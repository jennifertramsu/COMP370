pony,dialog
Narrator,"Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land. To do this, the eldest used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for their kingdom and their subjects, all the different types of ponies. But as time went on, the younger sister became resentful. The ponies relished and played in the day her elder sister brought forth, but shunned and slept through her beautiful night. One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused to lower the moon to make way for the dawn. The elder sister tried to reason with her, but the bitterness in the young one's heart had transformed her into a wicked mare of darkness: Nightmare Moon."
Narrator,"She vowed that she would shroud the land in eternal night. Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed the most powerful magic known to ponydom: the Elements of Harmony. Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony, she defeated her younger sister, and banished her permanently in the moon. The elder sister took on responsibility for both..."
Narrator and Twilight Sparkle,...sun and moon...
Twilight Sparkle,...and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since. Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where?
Twinkleshine,"There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on."
Twinkleshine,[sigh] Does that pony do anything except study? I think she's more interested in books than friends.
Twilight Sparkle,I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.
Spike,Ow!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Spi-ike! Spike?
Twilight Sparkle,"There you are. Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?"
Spike,"Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing."
Spike,But we're on a break!
Twilight Sparkle,"No, no, no... no, no, no! [grunts] Spike!"
Spike,It's over here!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ah! Elements, Elements, E, E, E... Aha! Elements of Harmony, see: Mare in the Moon?"
Spike,Mare in the Moon? But that's just an old ponies' tale.
Twilight Sparkle,"Mare, mare... aha! The Mare in the Moon, myth from olden pony times. A powerful pony who wanted to rule Equestria, defeated by the Elements of Harmony and imprisoned in the moon. Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about nighttime eternal! [gasp] Spike! Do you know what this means?"
Spike,No<U+0097> whoa!
Spike,Ow!
Twilight Sparkle,"Take a note please, to the Princess."
Spike,Okie dokie.
Twilight Sparkle,"My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!"
Spike,Hold on. Preci... preci...
Twilight Sparkle,Threshold.
Spike,Threh...
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, brink? Ugh, that something really bad is about to happen! For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she's about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
Spike,Twi... light Spar... kle. Got it!
Twilight Sparkle,Great! Send it.
Spike,Now?
Twilight Sparkle,Of course!
Spike,"Uh, I dunno, Twilight, Princess Celestia's a little busy getting ready for the Summer Sun Celebration. And it's like, the day after tomorrow."
Twilight Sparkle,"That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the Princess is told right away!"
Spike,Impera... impera...
Twilight Sparkle,Important!
Spike,Whoa!
Spike,"Okay, okay! [inhale] There, it's on its way. But I wouldn't hold your breath..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The Princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me."
Twilight Sparkle,See? I knew she would want to take immediate action.
Spike,"[clears throat] My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely."
Twilight Sparkle,Mm-hm!
Spike,...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books!
Spike,"My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying, so I'm sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year's location: Ponyville. And, I have an even more essential task for you to complete: make some friends!"
Spike,"Look on the bright side, Twilight. The Princess arranged for you to stay in a library. Doesn't that make you happy?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, yes it does. You know why? Because I'm right! I'll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon's return."
Spike,"Then... when will you make friends, like the Princess said?"
Twilight Sparkle,"She said to check on preparations. I am her student, and I'll do my royal duty, but the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you, sirs."
Spike,"Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about. Come on, Twilight, just try!"
Twilight Sparkle,Um... hello?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, that was interesting all right."
Spike,"Summer Sun Celebration official overseer's checklist. Number one, banquet preparations: Sweet Apple Acres."
Applejack,Yeehaw!
Twilight Sparkle,[sigh] Let's get this over with... Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle<U+0097>
Applejack,"Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like makin' new friends!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Friends? Actually, I<U+0097>"
Applejack,"So, what can I do you for?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[clears throat] Well, I am in fact here to supervise preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. And you're in charge of the food?"
Applejack,We sure as sugar are! Would you care to sample some?
Twilight Sparkle,As long as it doesn't take too long...
Applejack,"Soup's on, everypony!"
Applejack,"Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks, but I really need to hurry<U+0097>"
Applejack,"This here's Apple Fritter. Apple Bumpkin. Red Gala. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp... [deep breath] Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom and Granny Smith. Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests."
Granny Smith,"[snort] Wha..? Soup's on? I'm up, here I come, ahm comin'..."
Applejack,"Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[spit] [nervous laughter] Okay, well, I can see the food situation is handled, so we'll be on our way."
Apple Bloom,Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do..."
Twilight Sparkle,...fine.
Spike,"Food's all taken care of, next is weather."
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh... I ate too much pie...
Spike,"Hmm, there's supposed to be a Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?"
Twilight Sparkle,Nng.
Twilight Sparkle,Nnnn.
Rainbow Dash,[laughter] Lemme help you.
Twilight Sparkle,Let me guess. You're Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash,"The one and only. Why, you heard of me?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I heard you were supposed to be keeping the sky clear. [sigh] I'm Twilight Sparkle, and the Princess sent me to check on the weather."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon as I'm done practicing."
Twilight Sparkle,Practicing for what?
Rainbow Dash,"The Wonderbolts! They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!"
Twilight Sparkle,The Wonderbolts?
Rainbow Dash,Yep!
Twilight Sparkle,The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?
Rainbow Dash,That's them!
Twilight Sparkle,Pfft! Please. They'd never accept a Pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat."
Twilight Sparkle,Prove it.
Rainbow Dash,"[sounds of exertion] Loop-de-loop around, and wham! What'd I say? Ten. Seconds. Flat. I'd never leave Ponyville hanging. [sheep baaing] [chuckles] You should see the look on your face. Ha! You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle. I can't wait to hang out some more."
Twilight Sparkle,Rrgh.
Spike,Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it!
Spike,Decorations. Beautiful...
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, the d<e9>cor is coming along nicely. This ought'a be quick. I'll be at the library in no time. Beautiful indeed."
Spike,"Not the d<e9>cor, her!"
Rarity,"No, no, no, oh! Goodness no."
Spike,How are my spines? Are they straight?
Twilight Sparkle,Good afternoon<U+0097>
Rarity,"Just a moment, please! I'm 'in the zone', as it were. Oh, yes! Sparkle always does the trick, does it not? Why, Rarity, you are a talent. Now, um, how can I help yo<U+0097> [yelp] Oh my stars, darling! Whatever happened to your coiffure?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story. I'm just here to check on the decorations, and then I'll be out of your hair!"
Rarity,Out of my hair? What about your hair?!
Twilight Sparkle,Wait! Where are we going?! Help!
Rarity,"No, no, uh-uh. Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too... shiny. Now go on, my dear. You were telling me where you're from."
Twilight Sparkle,[wincing] I've... been sent... from Canterlot... to<U+0097>
Rarity,Huh?
Rarity,"Canterlot?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamour, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can't wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I... Emeralds?! What was I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!"
Twilight Sparkle,Quick! Before she decides to dye my coat a new color!
Spike,Wasn't she wonderful?
Twilight Sparkle,"Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?"
Spike,"[clears throat] Oh, uh, music! It's the last one!"
Fluttershy,"Oh my. Um, stop please, everyone, umm. Excuse me, sir? I mean no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off. Now, follow me, please. A-one, a-two, a-one two three-"
Twilight Sparkle,Hello!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh my, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to frighten your birds. I'm just here to check up on the music and it's sounding beautiful. [pause] I'm Twilight Sparkle. [pause] What's your name?"
Fluttershy,[very quietly] Um... I'm Fluttershy.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, what was that?"
Fluttershy,[even quieter] Um... My name is Fluttershy.
Twilight Sparkle,Didn't quite catch that.
Twilight Sparkle,"[pause] Well, um, it looks like your birds are back, so I guess everything's in order. Keep up the good work!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oookay. [to Spike] Well, that was easy."
Fluttershy,[gasp] A baby dragon!
Fluttershy,"Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before. He's sooo cute!"
Spike,"Well, well, well...!"
Fluttershy,"Oh my, he talks. I didn't know dragons could talk. That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, in that case we'd better be going."
Fluttershy,"Wait, wait! What's his name?"
Spike,I'm Spike.
Fluttershy,"Hi Spike, I'm Fluttershy. Wow, a talking dragon! And what do dragons talk about?"
Spike,"Well, what do you wanna know?"
Fluttershy,Absolutely everything.
Spike,Well... I started out as a cute little purple and green egg...
Spike,"...and that's the story of my whole entire life! Well, up until today. Do you wanna hear about today?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, yes, please!"
Spike,Gyah!
Twilight Sparkle,"I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep."
Spike,No I don't<U+0097> whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,"Aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!"
Fluttershy,"Poor thing, you simply must get into bed..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, yes, we'll get right on that. Well, g'night!"
Spike,Huh. Rude much?
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light?"
Ponies,Surprise!
Pinkie Pie,Surprise!
Pinkie Pie,"Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to be quiet.
Pinkie Pie,"Well, that's silly! What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? I mean, duh, bo-ring! Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember? You were all ""hello"" and I was all [deep gasp], remember? Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I mean everypony in Ponyville!"
Pinkie Pie,"And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went [deep gasp]! I must throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville! See? And now you have lots and lots of friends!"
Applejack,"Are you all right, sugarcube?"
Pinkie Pie,"Aww, she's so happy she's crying!"
Spike,"""Hot sauce""."
Pinkie Pie,Ooh... [with mouth full] What? It's good!
Spike,"Hey Twilight! Pinkie Pie's starting ""pin the tail on the pony""! Wanna play?"
Twilight Sparkle,No! All the ponies in this town are crazy! Do you know what time it is?!
Spike,"It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration. Everypony has to stay up, or they'll miss the Princess raise the sun! You really should lighten up, Twilight. It's a party!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! ""Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night."" I hope the Princess was right... I hope it really is just an old pony tale..."
Spike,"C'mon, Twilight, it's time to watch the sunrise!"
Pinkie Pie,"Isn't this exciting? Are you excited, 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited<U+0097> well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went [deep gasp] but I mean really, who can top that?"
Mayor Mare,"Fillies and gentlecolts, as mayor of Ponyville, it is my great pleasure to announce the beginning of the Summer Sun Celebration!"
Mayor Mare,"In just a few moments, our town will witness the magic of the sunrise, and celebrate this, the longest day of the year! And now, it is my great honor to introduce to you the ruler of our land, the very pony who gives us the sun and the moon each and every day, the good, the wise, the bringer of harmony to all of Equestria..."
Fluttershy,Ready?
Mayor Mare,...Princess Celestia!
Rarity,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,This can't be good.
Mayor Mare,"Remain calm, everypony, there must be a reasonable explanation!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding?"
Rarity,She's gone!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh no... Nightmare Moon!
Nightmare Moon,"Oh, my beloved subjects. It's been so long since I've seen your precious little sun-loving faces."
Rainbow Dash,What did you do with our Princess?!
Applejack,"[muffled] Whoa there, Nelly..."
Nightmare Moon,"[chuckle] Why, am I not royal enough for you? Don't you know who I am?"
Nightmare Moon,Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years? Did you not recall the legend? Did you not see the signs?
Twilight Sparkle,I did. And I know who you are. You're the Mare in the Moon <U+0096> Nightmare Moon!
Nightmare Moon,"Well well well, somepony who remembers me. Then you also know why I'm here."
Twilight Sparkle,"""Elements of Harmony, see 'Mare in the Moon'""?"
Spike,But that's just an old ponies' tale.
Twilight Sparkle,She will bring about nighttime eternal.
Twilight Sparkle,It's imperative that the princess is told right away.
Twilight Sparkle,I knew she would wanna take immediate action.
Spike,"My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying. Make some friends!"
Twilight Sparkle,All the ponies in this town are crazy!
Twilight Sparkle,I hope the Princess was right.
Rarity,She's gone!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh no. Nightmare Moon!
Mayor Mare,Seize her! Only she knows where the Princess is!
Applejack,Ergh...
Rainbow Dash,Come back here! [pants] Nighttime? Forever? Where's she going?
Spike,Uh... We gotta stop Nightmare!...
Twilight Sparkle,"You've been up all night, Spike. You are a baby dragon after all. Elements, elements, elements... Ugh! How can I stop Nightmare Moon without the Elements of Harmony?"
Rainbow Dash,"And just what are the Elements of Harmony? And how did you know about Nightmare Moon, huh? Are you a spy? Whoa!"
Applejack,"Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy. But she sure knows what's going on. Don't you, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I read all about the prediction of Nightmare Moon. Some mysterious objects called the Elements of Harmony are the only things that can stop her, but I don't know what they are, where to find them; I don't even know what they do!"
Pinkie Pie,"""The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide."""
Twilight Sparkle,How did you find that?!
Pinkie Pie,"[sing-song voice] It was under ""E""!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh. There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known: Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now--"
Everypony,The Everfree Forest!
Pinkie Pie,Whee! Let's go!
Twilight Sparkle,"Not so fast. Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd really rather do this on my own."
Applejack,"No can do, sugarcube. We sure ain't lettin' any friend of ours go into that creepy place alone. We're stickin' to you like caramel on a candy apple."
Pinkie Pie,Especially if there's candy apples in there. What? Those things are good.
Twilight Sparkle,"So, none of you have been in here before?"
Rarity,"Ugh, heavens no! Just look at it - it's dreadful."
Applejack,And it ain't natural. Folks say it don't work the same as Equestria.
Twilight Sparkle,What's that supposed to mean?
Rainbow Dash,Nopony knows. You know why?
Applejack,"Rainbow, quit it."
Rainbow Dash,'cause everypony who's ever come in has never come out!
Rainbow Dash,Fluttershy! Quick!
Fluttershy,"Oh my goodness, oh my goodness."
Applejack,Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack! What do I do?
Applejack,Let go.
Twilight Sparkle,Are you crazy?
Applejack,No I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
Twilight Sparkle,That's not true!
Applejack,"Now listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe."
Twilight Sparkle,Yaaah! Phew-wah!
Fluttershy,Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.
Rainbow Dash,"And once Pinkie and Rarity were saved, whoosh... Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, Rainbow, I was there, and I'm very grateful, but we gotta- [gasp] A manticore!"
Twilight Sparkle,We've gotta get past him!
Rarity,"Take that, you ruffian!"
Rarity,My hair! Woop--
Fluttershy,Wait.
Applejack,"YEE-HAW! Git along, little dogie."
Fluttershy,Wait.
Applejack,"Whoa! All yours, partner."
Rainbow Dash,I'm on it.
Fluttershy,Wait!
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow!
Fluttershy,WAIT!
Fluttershy,"Shhh... It's okay. Oh, you poor, poor little baby."
Rainbow Dash,Little?
Fluttershy,Now this might hurt for just a second.
Everypony,Fluttershy!
Fluttershy,"[giggles] Aw you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you? Yes you are, yes you are."
Twilight Sparkle,How did you know about the thorn?
Fluttershy,I didn't. Sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness.
Rarity,"No. My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck. Well, I didn't mean that literally."
Twilight Sparkle,That ancient ruin could be right in front of our faces and we wouldn't even know it.
Rarity,"I didn't see you there, my apologies."
Rainbow Dash,Right here... guh...
Applejack,"Oh wait, I think I stepped in somethin'."
Applejack,It's just mud.
Applejack,Aah!
Everypony,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh girls, don't you see?"
Pinkie Pie,When I was a little filly and the sun was going down...
Twilight Sparkle,Tell me she's not...
Pinkie Pie,"The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown..."
Rarity,She is.
Pinkie Pie,I'd hide under my pillow From what I thought I saw But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way To deal with fears at all
Rainbow Dash,Then what is?
Pinkie Pie,"She said, ""Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall Learn to face your fears You'll see that they can't hurt you Just laugh to make them disappear."""
Others,Ha! Ha! Ha!
Pinkie Pie,"So, giggle at the ghostly Guffaw at the grossly Crack up at the creepy Whoop it up with the weepy Chortle at the kooky Snortle at the spooky"
Others,And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... hahahaha... heh...
Others,Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuugh!
Pinkie Pie,How are we gonna cross this?
Pinkie Pie,Huh?
Steven Magnet,"[sobbing] What a world, what a world."
Twilight Sparkle,"Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, give me a break."
Applejack,That's what all the fuss is about?
Rarity,"Why, of course it is. How can you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales."
Steven Magnet,[sniffs] I know.
Rarity,And your expertly coiffed mane.
Steven Magnet,"Oh, I know, I know."
Rarity,Your fabulous manicure.
Steven Magnet,[gasp] It's so true!
Rarity,All ruined without your beautiful mustache.
Steven Magnet,"It's true, I'm hideous!"
Rarity,I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
Steven Magnet,[yelp] What did you do that for?
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, what are you-"
Steven Magnet,[moans] Oh-hohohoho! My mustache. How wonderful.
Rarity,You look smashing.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Rarity, your beautiful tail..."
Rarity,"Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back."
Rainbow Dash,So would the mustache.
Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] We can cross now. Let's go. Ah!
Steven Magnet,Allow me.
Twilight Sparkle,"There it is, the ruin that holds The Elements of Harmony. We made it!"
Applejack,"Twilight, wait for us!"
Twilight Sparkle,We're almost there. Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,What's with you and falling off cliffs today?
Pinkie Pie,[sighs] Now what?
Rainbow Dash,Duh.
Pinkie Pie,Oh yeah.
Shadowbolt Leader,Rainbow...
Rainbow Dash,Who's there?
Shadowbolt Leader,Rainbow...
Rainbow Dash,I ain't scared of you! Show yourself!
Shadowbolt Leader,We've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the best flyer in Equestria.
Rainbow Dash,Who?
Shadowbolt Leader,"Why, you, of course."
Rainbow Dash,"Really?! I mean... Oh yeah, me. Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya? 'cause I've been trying to get into that group for like, ever."
Shadowbolt Leader,"No, Rainbow Dash. We want you to join us, The Shadowbolts. We're the greatest aerial team in the Everfree Forest, and soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria, but first, we need a captain. The most magnificent-"
Rainbow Dash,Yep.
Shadowbolt Leader,Swiftest-
Rainbow Dash,Yes.
Shadowbolt Leader,Bravest flyer in all the land.
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, [chuckle] it's all true."
Shadowbolt Leader,We need... you.
Rainbow Dash,WOOHOO! Sign me up. Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
Shadowbolt Leader,No! It's them or us.
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow, what's taking so long? Oh no. Rainbow! Don't listen to them."
Shadowbolt Leader,Well?
Rainbow Dash,"You... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no."
Rainbow Dash,See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.
Twilight Sparkle,Whoa.
Applejack,"Come on, Twilight. Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?"
Twilight Sparkle,"The Elements of Harmony, we've found them. Careful, careful!"
Pinkie Pie,"One, two, three, four... There's only five!"
Rainbow Dash,Where's the sixth?
Twilight Sparkle,"The book said: when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed."
Applejack,What in the hay is that supposed to mean?
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Stand back. I don't know what will happen."
Applejack,"Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate."
Twilight Sparkle,Aah!
Everypony,Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,The Elements!
Applejack,"Twilight, where are you?"
Rarity,Look!
Applejack,Come on!
Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] Hmph!
Nightmare Moon,"You're kidding. You're kidding, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[groan] Just one spark. Come on, come on. Aah!"
Nightmare Moon,"No, no!"
Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] But... where's the sixth Element?!
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasp] You think you can destroy The Elements of Harmony just like that? Well, you're wrong, because the spirits of The Elements of Harmony are right here."
Nightmare Moon,What?
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty! Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness! Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter! Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity! And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty! The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us."
Nightmare Moon,You still don't have the sixth Element! The spark didn't work!
Twilight Sparkle,"But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you, how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside me when I realized that you all... are my friends! You see, Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the... the spark, that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element: the element of... magic!"
Nightmare Moon,Nooo! Nooo!
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, my head."
Applejack,Everypony okay?
Rarity,"Oh, thank goodness."
Fluttershy,"Why Rarity, it's so lovely."
Rarity,I know! I'll never part with it again.
Fluttershy,No. Your necklace. It looks just like your cutie mark.
Rarity,What? Ooh. So does yours.
Pinkie Pie,Look at mine! Look at mine!
Rainbow Dash,Aw yeah.
Applejack,"Gee, Twilight! I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship."
Princess Celestia,Indeed you do.
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Princess Celestia.
Princess Celestia,"Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it."
Twilight Sparkle,But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.
Princess Celestia,"I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return, and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna!"
Princess Celestia,"It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister."
Twilight Sparkle and Rainbow Dash,Sister?
Princess Celestia,Will you accept my friendship?
Pinkie Pie,Whoa!
Princess Luna,"I'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister!"
Princess Celestia,"I've missed you, too."
Pinkie Pie,"[blows her nose] [sobs] Hey, you know what this calls for?"
Pinkie Pie,A party!
Princess Celestia,"Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?"
Twilight Sparkle,"That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them."
Princess Celestia,"Spike, take a note, please. I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh thank you, Princess Celestia! I'll study harder than ever before."
Pinkie Pie,"Isn't this exciting? Are you excited cause I'm excited I've never been so excited, well, except for the time that I went [deep gasp] but I mean really-"
Twilight Sparkle,"No problem at all, Applejack. I'm glad the goal is lunchtime. All this hard work is making me hungry."
Spike,"I know, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ooh-wee, Spike. You've been lounging on my back all morning while we worked."
Spike,"Exactly. You two are taking so long, I missed snack-time."
Twilight Sparkle,"[stomach grumbles] [laughs nervously] Eh, I guess we better get some food."
Spike,Nope. Worm. A-ha!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh Spike, that looks delicious."
Twilight Sparkle,Spike.
Twilight Sparkle,It's a letter from Princess Celestia.
Spike,"[clears throat] Hear ye, hear ye. Her Grand Royal Highness, Princess Celestia of Equestria, is pleased to announce the Grand Galloping Gala to be held in the magnificent capital city of Canterlot, on the 21st day of, eh, yadda yadda yadda, cordially extends an invitation to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest."
Applejack and Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] The Grand Galloping Gala!
Applejack,Woo-hoo!
Spike,"[burp] Look, two tickets."
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. Have you, Spike?"
Spike,"No, and I plan to keep it that way. I don't want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense."
Twilight Sparkle,"Aw, come on Spike. A dance would be nice."
Applejack,"Nice? It's a heap good more than just nice. I'd love to go. Land sakes, if I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles 'til the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip."
Applejack,"Why, I'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, well in that case, would you like to--"
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! [crash] Ugh. Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala?
Applejack,Rainbow Dash. You told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. What were you busy doing? Spyin'?
Rainbow Dash,"No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, but--"
Rainbow Dash,"YES! This is so awesome. The Wonderbolts perform at the Grand Galloping Gala every year. I can see it now. Everyone would be watching the sky. Their eyes riveted on the Wonderbolts, but then in would fly Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,I would draw their attention with my Super Speed Strut.
Rainbow Dash,"Then, I would mesmerize 'em with my Fantastic Filly Flash. And for my grand finale, the Buccaneer Blaze! The ponies would go wild!"
Rainbow Dash,"The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member."
Applejack,Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here. [spit] I asked for that ticket first.
Rainbow Dash,So? That doesn't mean you own it.
Applejack,"Oh, yeah? Well I challenge you to a hoof-wrestle. Winner gets the ticket."
Twilight Sparkle,"Girls, these are my tickets, I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much. Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think?"
Applejack,Drummin' up business for the farm?
Rainbow Dash,A chance to audition for the Wonderbolts?
Applejack,Money t' fix Granny's hip.
Rainbow Dash,Living the dream.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh my, those were all pretty good reasons, aren't they? [stomach rumbles] [chuckles] Listen to that, I am starving. I don't know about you, but I can't make important decisions on an empty stomach, so I'll, uh, think about it over lunch and get back to you two, okay?"
Spike,"So, who you gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know Spike, but I really can't think straight when I'm hungry, so where should we eat?"
Pinkie Pie,"[crash] Gah! Bats! Bats on my face! Help! Wait, these aren't... tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala?! It's the most amazing incredible tremendous super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous party in all of Equestria! I've always always always wanted to go!"
Pinkie Pie,Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me Hip hip Hooray! It's the best place for me For Pinkie...
Pinkie Pie,With decorations like streamers and fairy-lights and pinwheels and pi<f1>atas and pin-cushions. With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sun-beams and sarsaparilla. And I get to play my favorite-est of favorite fantabulous games like Pin the Tail on the Pony!
Pinkie Pie,Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me 'Cause it's the most galarrific superly-terrific gala ever In the whole galaxy Wheee!!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh thank you, Twilight, it's the most wonderful-est gift ever."
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, actually--"
Rarity,[gasp] Are these what I think they are?
Twilight Sparkle,Uh--
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, yes, yes! Twilight's taking me to the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot."
Rarity,"The gala? I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I've never had the opportunity to attend. Oh, the society, the culture, the glamour! It's where I truly belong, and where I'm destined to meet him."
Pinkie Pie,Him! ... Who?
Rarity,"Him. I would stroll through the gala, and everyone would wonder, ""Who is that mysterious mare?"" They would never guess that I was just a simple pony from little old Ponyville. Why, I would cause such a sensation that I would be invited for an audience with Princess Celestia herself, and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him, her nephew: the most handsome, eligible unicorn stallion in Canterlot. Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt. Our courtship would be magnificent. He would ask for my hoof in marriage, and of course I would say, ""Yes!"" We would have a royal wedding, befitting a princess, which is [giggles] what I would become upon marrying him, the stallion of my dreams."
Rarity,"Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can... party, and prevent me from meeting my true love. How could you? Hmph."
Spike,Hey!
Fluttershy,"[gasp] Angel, these are perfect."
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, listen guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to."
Rarity and Pinkie Pie,You haven't?
Fluttershy,"Um, excuse me, Twilight. I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be all right, if you haven't given it to someone else--"
Rarity,You? You want to go to the gala?
Fluttershy,"Oh, no. I mean, yes, or, actually, kind of. You see, it's not so much the Grand Galloping Gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance. The flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria. For the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom... and that's just the flora! Don't get me started on the fauna. There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my! Hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz. White-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful...?"
Rainbow Dash,Wait just a minute.
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash! Were you following me?
Rainbow Dash,"No. I mean, yes. I mean, maybe. Look, it doesn't matter. I couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody."
Applejack,Wait just another minute.
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, were you following me too?"
Applejack,No. I was followin' this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business. Still trying to take mah ticket.
Rainbow Dash,Your ticket?
Pinkie Pie,But Twilight's taking me.
Twilight Sparkle,QUIET!
Pinkie Pie,"And then I said, ""Oatmeal, are you craz--"" oh."
Twilight Sparkle,"Girls, there's no use in arguing."
Rarity,But Twilight-
Twilight Sparkle,"Eh! This is my decision, and I'm gonna make it on my own, and I certainly can't think straight with all this noise... [stomach rumbles] not to mention hunger. Now go on, shoo."
Twilight Sparkle,"And don't worry, I'll figure this out... somehow."
Savoir Fare,Have you made your decision?
Twilight Sparkle,I CAN'T DECIDE!
Spike,"Twilight, he just wants to take your order."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.
Spike,"Do you have any rubies? No? Okay. I'll have the hay fries, extra crispy."
Twilight Sparkle,"What do you think, Spike?"
Spike,"I think we have to try another restaurant. I mean, I like grass just fine, but would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?"
Twilight Sparkle,I mean about the Gala and the ticket and who I should take.
Spike,Oh. You're still on that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, listen. How do I choose? And when I do choose, will the other four be mad at me? I mean, I could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. What if I--"
Savoir Fare,"Ah, your food."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure everything will be much clearer once I eat.
Savoir Fare,"Em, madam? Are you going to eat your food in ze rain?"
Twilight Sparkle,It's not raining... What's going on?
Rainbow Dash,"Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had. Enjoying the sunny weather?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?"
Rainbow Dash,"Whaddya mean? I just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so I thought I'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you?"
Rainbow Dash,"Me? No no no, of course not."
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-huh.
Rainbow Dash,"Seriously, I'd do it for anypony. [gulp] Heh heh, eh."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow, I am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so I'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now."
Rarity,"Twilight, it's raining."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, really?"
Rarity,Come with me before you catch a cold.
Twilight Sparkle,"Heh heh, oops, sorry."
Rarity,"Oh no, it's quite all right. After all, we are... the best of friends, are we not? And you know what the best of friends do?"
Twilight Sparkle,Uh...
Rarity,Makeovers!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, Rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. I mean, thank you but, ooh, that's too tight."
Rarity,"There. Oh, you're simply darling."
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it?"
Rarity,"And you. Oh Spike, I have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent."
Spike,"D-ah, ow, oh, hey, wow, watch it, whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[giggles] Oh, Spike."
Rarity,Now you just need a hat.
Spike,"Ugh, I told you, I don't want any part of this girly gala gunk. See you back at the library."
Rarity,"[laughs] Oh, who needs him anyway. This is all about you, and how fabulous you'll look at the Grand Galloping Gala."
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait, the Grand--"
Rarity,"[gasp] And oh, my goodness, what a coincidence. I happen to have an ensemble of my own that matches yours to a T. We would be the belles of the ball, you and I. Everyone would be clamoring for our attention. All eyes would be on us, and then everyone would finally know, the most beautiful, most talented, most sophisticated pony in all of Equestria is Rarity the unicorn. Ah, [nervous laughter] and Twilight Sparkle, of course."
Twilight Sparkle,"I see what's going on. You're just buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket. Well it's not gonna work. You're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I've been trying all day just to get some lunch."
Applejack,Did somepony say lunch?
Twilight Sparkle,You've got to be kidding me!
Applejack,"I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts, apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumblers, and apple Brown Betty. Uh, the dessert, not my auntie. What do you say there, best friend?"
Applejack,Is that a yes?
Twilight Sparkle,"No. No. I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. In fact, I'm less sure now than I was this morning. Ugh!"
Applejack,"So, that's a maybe?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, I never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating."
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasp] Fluttershy, not you too?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, well, hello Twilight. I hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you."
Twilight Sparkle,It's summer.
Fluttershy,"Oh, well, better late than never, right? It was Angel's idea."
Twilight Sparkle,"You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?"
Fluttershy,"Oh no, I'm doing this because you're my very best friend. Right, Angel? Oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, no, no! Well, this was all very nice of you and Angel, but I'm not accepting any extra favors until I've made my final decision, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
Ponies,SURPRISE!
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight is my bestest friend Whoopie, whoopie!"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie...
Pinkie Pie,"She's the cutest, smartest, all around best pony, pony!"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie.
Pinkie Pie,"I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party, party!"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie,She'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to me!
Twilight Sparkle,PIIINKIIIE!!
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,At least the other ponies tried to be subtle about the ticket.
Drizzle,"Wait, what ticket? What gala?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, you didn't know? Twilight has an extra ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala!"
Others,"Ponies, The Grand Galloping Gala?!"
Daisy,Would you like any help with your gardening?
Shoeshine,I have a cartload of extra carrots.
Spike,What are we gonna do?
Twilight Sparkle,We're... gonna... run!
Spike,Ugh... Warn me next time you're gonna do that.
Twilight Sparkle,"I didn't even know it was gonna happen. Now quick, lock the doors. Yaaaargh! I can't decide, I just can't decide. It's important to all of you and I just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and I wanna make you all happy and I can't, I just can't!"
Applejack,"Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore. You can give it to somepony else. I won't feel bad, I promise."
Fluttershy,Me too. I feel just awful that I made you feel so awful.
Pinkie Pie,And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends.
Rarity,"Twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as I did."
Rainbow Dash,"Yes! That means the ticket is mine. Ha ha, [sing-song voice] I got the ticket, I got the ticket-- you know, I haven't perfected my signature moves for the Wonderbolts anyway. I don't need that ticket either."
Applejack,We all got so gun-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how un-gun-ho we were making you.
Ponies in unison,"We're sorry, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, take down a note. Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala."
Ponies in unison,What?!
Twilight Sparkle,"If my friends can't all go, I don't wanna go either."
Applejack,"Twilight, you don't have to do that."
Twilight Sparkle,"Nope. I've made up my mind. Spike, you can send the letter now."
Fluttershy,Now you won't get to go to the gala either.
Twilight Sparkle,"It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me, so I would rather not go at all."
Spike,Hgh... hgh... urk... urk...
Applejack,"Well wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like a boy? Can't handle the least bit of sentiment."
Applejack,Whoa Nelly!
Twilight Sparkle,A letter from the princess? That was fast.
Spike,"""My faithful student Twilight,"
Others,"Why didn't you just say so in the first place?"" Six tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala."
Twilight Sparkle,Now we can all go.
Rarity,Allow us to treat you to dinner.
Rainbow Dash,What a great way to apologize.
Pinkie Pie,"And to celebrate. Come on everyone, the cupcakes are on me."
Applejack,Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. That there is the biggest bumper crop o' apples I ever laid eyes on.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup. Too big for you to handle on your own.
Applejack,"Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. Oops, sorry. I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end."
Big McIntosh,Biting off more than you can chew is just what I'm afraid of.
Applejack,Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,"Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?"
Big McIntosh,"But still only one pony, and one pony plus hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to..."
Applejack,Well I better get kickin'. These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees. Hey! Oh no.
Rainbow Dash,STAMPEDE!
Sweetie Drops,Stampede!
Pinkie Pie,[laughter] Hey...! [vibrating] This makes my voice sound silly!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run!"
Mayor Mare,Everypony calm down. There is no need to panic.
Rarity,"But Mayor, whatever shall we do?"
Rainbow Dash,Look there!
Applejack,YEEHAW!
Applejack,"Move aside, Winona. Put 'em up, girl!"
Applejack,Attagirl. [grunts] Yee haw!
Applejack,Whoaaa. Hooie. Now what was that all about?
DaisyJo,"[moo] [cough] Oh my! Begging your pardon, Applejack, but Moo-riella here saw one of those nasty snakes."
DaisyJo,"And it just gave us all the willies, don'tcha know."
Applejack,"I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville."
DaisyJo,"We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!"
Applejack,Yee haw!
Pinkie Pie,"Yee haw! Ride 'em, cowpony!"
Mayor Mare,Applejack was just... just...
Pinkie Pie,Appletastic!
Mayor Mare,Exactly. We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.
Pinkie Pie,I know.
Pinkie Pie,A party!
Twilight Sparkle,We all ready?
Rarity,Just one last thing. Now we're ready.
Twilight Sparkle,Is Applejack all set?
Rainbow Dash,"Actually, I haven't seen her all week."
Pinkie Pie,Not since the stampede.
Rainbow Dash,But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late.
Twilight Sparkle,"Welcome, everypony! Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. A pony whose contributions to--"
Rainbow Dash,"Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? What an athlete. This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome."
Twilight Sparkle,Exactly. And...
Pinkie Pie,"This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time."
Twilight Sparkle,What does that have to do with Applejack?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh. Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me. Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter--"
Fluttershy,Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,--rupted.
Fluttershy,"Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills."
Twilight Sparkle,"Anyone else? Anyone? No? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! Never mind."
Mayor Mare,"Ah-ahem. And so, with no further ado, it is my privilege to give the prize, Pony of Ponyville Award, to our beloved guest of honor, a pony of the utmost trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity. Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend: Applejack!"
Spike,"Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean-- heh."
Mayor Mare,Ah-ahem.
Spike,Awkward.
Applejack,"I'm here. I'm here. [yawn] [sigh] Sorry I'm late--whoa--I was just... whoa... Did I get your tail? Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for this here... award thingy. [yawn] It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh. Ooo-ooo."
Pinkie Pie,Woo-ooo.
Applejack,Ooo-ooo.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay. Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony."
Applejack,"[yawn] Yeah. I like helping the ponyfolks and [yawn] and stuff. [snore] Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Thanks."
Twilight Sparkle,"Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little--"
Rainbow Dash,Tired?
Fluttershy,Dizzy?
Rarity,"Messy? Well, did you see her mane?"
Pinkie Pie,She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo!
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm.
Applejack,[grunts] [sigh] Phew. [gasp] O-oah.
Twilight Sparkle,What on Earth is that pony doing?
Applejack,Whoops.
Twilight Sparkle,Hey Applejack!
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack.
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack. AppleJACK!
Applejack,"Oh, howdy, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,What is all this?
Applejack,It's Applebuck season. Whoa.
Twilight Sparkle,Applewhat season?
Applejack,"Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em."
Twilight Sparkle,But why are you doing it all alone?
Applejack,'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.
Twilight Sparkle,What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?
Applejack,"[sigh] They were just here for the Apple family reunion. They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards. So, uh, I'm on my own. Which means, I should really get back to work. Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?"
Twilight Sparkle,Fine.
Applejack,"Could you step aside, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good."
Applejack,"Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa."
Twilight Sparkle,Do you... want some help?
Applejack,"Help? No way, no how."
Twilight Sparkle,But there's no way you can do it all on your own.
Applejack,Is that a challenge?
Twilight Sparkle,Uhm... no?
Applejack,"Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck."
Rainbow Dash,There you are.
Applejack,"[yawn] I'm a mite sorry, Rainbow. I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late. Now, what's this new trick a' yours?"
Rainbow Dash,See this contraption?
Applejack,Uh... Yeah.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts."
Applejack,Isn't that a mite dangerous?
Rainbow Dash,"Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly."
Applejack,"Well, all right-y then. Oh my."
Rainbow Dash,Ready? One... two... THREE!
Rainbow Dash,Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end.
Rainbow Dash,"Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!"
Applejack,"You are. I'm okay. Really. I-I have an idea. Watch this. [groan] Ta da! Oh... Maybe not. Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time."
Rainbow Dash,Ugh!
Applejack,Heh heh... Here I go!
Rainbow Dash,"Wait, Applejaaaaack!"
Applejack,You're welcome!
Twilight Sparkle,Can I help you?
Rainbow Dash,I think somepony else needs your help.
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack?
Rainbow Dash,Yep.
Applejack,Ow!
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, can we talk? Applejack, can we talk?"
Applejack,Can bees squawk?! I don't think so.
Twilight Sparkle,No. Can we talk?
Applejack,Twenty stalks? Bean or celery?
Twilight Sparkle,No! I need to talk to you.
Applejack,"You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you?"
Twilight Sparkle,I need to talk to you!
Applejack,Oh! Well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about?
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.
Applejack,That's quite neighborly of her.
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air."
Applejack,"Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning."
Twilight Sparkle,Because you're working too hard and you need help.
Applejack,What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed.
Twilight Sparkle,HELP! You need HELP!
Applejack,"Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own. Ow! Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie."
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Now Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?"
Pinkie Pie,"Yes siree bob, Mrs. Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker ever. Right, Applejack?"
Mr. Cake,Mr. No? You're not the best baker ever?
Applejack,"WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye."
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. [sigh] All right. Well, see you later, girls!"
Pinkie Pie,"Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'."
Pinkie Pie,All right-y! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?
Applejack,"Eh, uh, whu, what was that?"
Pinkie Pie,Chocolate chips.
Applejack,"Chips... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next?"
Pinkie Pie,Baking soda.
Applejack,Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. Now what?
Pinkie Pie,A cup of flour.
Applejack,"A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie,One last thing. Wheat germ.
Applejack,"Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms."
Pinkie Pie,Now that's gonna be delicious.
Applejack,If you say so.
Pinkie Pie,Free muffin sample spectacular!
Applejack,Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot.
Twilight Sparkle,We came as soon as we heard.
Nurse Redheart,"Oh thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh no! What happened?
Nurse Redheart,It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack.
Spike,[chomp] Want one?
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, we need to talk."
Applejack,"Wha, huh? Oh, it's you, Twilight. [yawn] I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no."
Twilight Sparkle,"Not to upset your applecart, but you need help."
Applejack,Hardy har. [groan] And no I don't.
Twilight Sparkle,"Here, let me help."
Applejack,Help? No thanks. [groan] A little more... [groan] Little... [grunt] There. I'll prove that this apple can handle these apples. Come on [grunt] apples [grunt] fall off [grunt].
Twilight Sparkle,"AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree."
Applejack,I knew that.
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and--"
Applejack,"You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,But if you'd just let me help--
Applejack,"Ugh. No, no, NO! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony!"
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.
Twilight Sparkle,No offense.
Mule,None taken.
Fluttershy,Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit roundup.
Applejack,Ugh. Why are we doin' this?
Fluttershy,"Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families."
Applejack,Fine. Can we just get on with it?
Fluttershy,"Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently."
Applejack,"I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?"
Fluttershy,"Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle."
Applejack,"That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. Hop to it. Swell. Just swell. Put 'em up, Winona!"
Fluttershy,Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them.
Applejack,"We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies."
Fluttershy,Oh no.
Rainbow Dash,STAMPEDE!
Daisy,[yelps] Stampede!
Rose,"The horror, the horror."
Lily Valley,It was awful.
Daisy,"A disaster. A horrible, horrible disaster."
Twilight Sparkle,I don't get it.
Lily Valley,"Our gardens, destroyed."
Rose,"Every last flower, devoured."
Daisy,By... by... THEM!
Fluttershy,"Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness."
Twilight Sparkle,All right. Enough is enough.
Applejack,Must [gasp] keep [gasp] buckin'... just [gasp] a few [gasp] more. Must finish harvestin'.
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help."
Applejack,"[grunts] Ha! No, I don't. Look, I did it. I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like them apples?"
Big McIntosh,"Um, how do you like them apples?"
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack. Applejack.
Applejack,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help anypony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you."
Applejack,"Okay, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"I am not taking ""no"" for an answer--what?"
Applejack,"Yes, Twilight. Yes, please. I could really use your help."
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help anypony. The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer."
Others,"Your faithful student,"
Others,Twilight Sparkle
Applejack,"How about y'all take a little break? I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya! [sigh] Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a bit stubborn."
Twilight Sparkle,A bit?
Applejack,"Okay. A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry. Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends."
Rainbow Dash,Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry.
Spike,And I've got the perfect treat.
Pinkie Pie,"Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them?"
Spike,From the trash.
Ponies,[in unison] EW!
Spike,Just a little nibble? Come on.
Ponies,Ew! Gross!
Pinkie Pie,"Hoof-biting action overload! She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then Rainbow Dash swooped down--swoosh--and right before she hit the ground--shoom-she pulled up--vrrrmmm!"
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-huh.
Pinkie Pie,And then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo!
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-huh. Phew.
Pinkie Pie,Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,[grunt] Pinkie Pie? Not again.
Pinkie Pie,Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash,"Not now, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,"But, but Rainbow Dash<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,I'm in the middle of something.
Pinkie Pie,But<U+0096>
Pinkie Pie,I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain.
Pinkie Pie,"[humming] Hi, I'm looking for Rainbow Dash. Have you seen her? Hi there, have you seen Rainbow Dash? Okay, thanks anyway. Twilight, have you seen Rainbow Dash anywhere?"
Twilight Sparkle,Isn't she right up there?
Pinkie Pie,Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash,Phew. That was close.
Pinkie Pie,Hi!
Rainbow Dash,Aah!
Pinkie Pie,Hi again.
Rainbow Dash,Aah!
Pinkie Pie,"Pfeh. I need a favor, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,"Waaa--oh, forget it."
Pinkie Pie,I totally promise it'll be totally fun.
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Okay.
Pinkie Pie,"Over to the right. No no, a little to the left. Oh wait, back to the right. Now a little leftish while staying rightly. Stop. Hmm. Maybe a few inches to the south. Now a couple centimeters north. Okay. One more smidgimeter to the--"
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, I mean, perfect. Now wait for my signal."
Pinkie Pie,"[laughing] Oh Rainbow Dash, we startled Spike into getting the hiccups."
Spike,"[chuckles] Good one, Pinkie [hiccup] Pie. [hiccup] You're always pulling a fast one [hiccup] on me. [hiccup] Nnaa--"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh no, you're not hurt are you?"
Spike,"Ne--[hiccup]--eh, don't be [hiccup] silly, dragons are [hiccup] fire-proof."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, okay, good."
Spike,I wish the same thing [hiccup] were true with scrolls.
Rainbow Dash,I can think of one thing.
Rainbow Dash,"I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie."
Rainbow Dash,"You know Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought."
Rainbow Dash,You wanna hang out?
Rainbow Dash,A simple nod would do.
Pinkie Pie,Mmm-hmm.
Rainbow Dash,Is she even home?
Pinkie Pie,I don't know. This is gonna be gold.
Rainbow Dash,There she is.
Pinkie Pie,Aaa-choo!
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm?
Applejack,[gasp] Land sakes!
Pinkie Pie,Is someone over there? Who're we gonna squirt? Who're we gonna squirt?
Rainbow Dash,[chuckles] Fluttershy.
Pinkie Pie,"WHAT? [spits] Nononononono, we can't prank Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive. It'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, you're right. [raspberry] Huh. We need another victim who's made of tougher stuff. So, who's it gonna be?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, [chuckles] I've got someone in mind. [chuckles] The toughest around."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, awesome. Who? Who? Do I know them?"
Pinkie Pie,"[giggles] Oh, yes. [giggles] You're very close."
Rainbow Dash,"[chuckles] Good one, Pinkie Pie."
Rainbow Dash,Ridiculous.
Pinkie Pie,[blows party hooter] Rise and shine Rainbow Dash! It's a brand new day and we got a lot of pranking to-- Ooh.
Rainbow Dash,"Mornin', Pinks. Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie."
Gilda,Hey. What's up?
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda."
Pinkie Pie,What's a griffon?
Rainbow Dash,"She's half-eagle, half-lion."
Gilda,"And all awesome. Raa. Heh-haa. Yeah, that's right."
Rainbow Dash,"Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp. Hey, remember the chant?"
Gilda,"Sha, they made us recite it every morning, I'll never get that lame thing out of my head."
Rainbow Dash,Sooo...
Gilda,"Ugh. Only for you, Dash."
Rainbow Dash and Gilda,"Junior Speedsters are our lives, Sky-bound soars and daring dives Junior Speedsters, it's our quest, To someday be the very best!"
Pinkie Pie,"[laughs] Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank. Gilda, you game?"
Gilda,"Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank as much as the next griffon. But Dash, you promised me we'd get a flying session in this morning."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you? Gilda just got here. We'll catch up with you later."
Gilda,"Whoa, that was sweet. Just like old times."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, only faster. So now what?"
Pinkie Pie,Hey there.
Gilda and Rainbow Dash,Huh?
Pinkie Pie,It's later. And I caught up.
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie, you are so random."
Gilda,"Hey Dash, think you got enough gas left to beat me to that cloud?"
Rainbow Dash,A race? You are so on.
Gilda,"One, two, three, go."
Pinkie Pie,Hey!
Rainbow Dash,I win.
Gilda,"As if. I won, dude."
Rainbow Dash,No way.
Gilda,Yes way.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, come on, I was way ahead of you."
Gilda,"Uh, I don't think so."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh Geez, dream on."
Gilda,Remember back in camp? I<U+0096>
Rainbow Dash,There is no way you beat me.
Gilda,Whatever.
Pinkie Pie,"Wow guys, that was really close, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather."
Rainbow Dash,"Hah, see? Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G."
Gilda,"Okay... Dash, last one to that cloud up there is a gnarly dragon egg. Go! [To Pinkie Pie] I think the high altitude is making you dizzy."
Pinkie Pie,"Wait, guys! Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time."
Gilda,"So, Dash, got any new moves in your tricktionary, or are you 100% old school?"
Rainbow Dash,"New moves? Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while."
Gilda,"Hey Pinkie, c'mere."
Pinkie Pie,Yeah?
Gilda,"Don't you know how to take get lost for an answer? Dash doesn't need to hang with a dweeb like you now that I'm around. You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie, so make like a bee and BUZZ OFF."
Pinkie Pie,[gasp] Whaaa-aaa<U+0096>
Rainbow Dash,"Try matching that. Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?"
Gilda,"Eh, she left. Something about being as busy as a bee."
Pinkie Pie,Hmph!
Twilight Sparkle,"So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?"
Pinkie Pie,"Um, yeah. She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. I've never met a griffon this mean. Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda."
Twilight Sparkle,"You know what I think, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,Hmm?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I think... you're jealous."
Pinkie Pie,Jealous?
Spike,"Green with envy. Well, in your case, pink with envy."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump. I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude."
Rainbow Dash,"[laughing] That was sweet. Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here. Shouldn't take long. Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya."
Gilda,"That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down."
Rainbow Dash,Later.
Granny Smith,"[sniffs] Aaah! A rattler, a rattler! Run for the hills! Everybody forsake yourselves!"
Gilda,"This stuff ain't fresh, dude."
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke. How mean. No, no, I can't misjudge her. It was kind of a funny prank, I guess."
Pinkie Pie,"[gasp] I did misjudge her. She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief. Nonononono, she might give it back. It's just a joke."
Fluttershy,"All right little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck, you're free and clear."
Gilda,Hey.
Fluttershy,Please excuse me.
Gilda,I'm walkin' here.
Fluttershy,"Oh, um, I'm sorry. I-I-I was just trying to..."
Gilda,"[mocking] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why don't you just watch where you're going, doofus?"
Fluttershy,B-b-b-but I... I...
Gilda,"Ugh, please, all these lame ponies are driving me buggy. I gotta bail."
Pinkie Pie,"She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully. The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is. I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No. One. This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style."
Pinkie Pie,"Welcome, welcome. Welcome!"
Applejack,Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?
Rarity,"I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare."
Twilight Sparkle,"You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight."
Pinkie Pie,Welcome. Welcome.
Fluttershy,"Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Umm... Do you really think it's a good idea? I mean<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda. Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of.
Fluttershy,I'm a year older than you.
Pinkie Pie,"Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. You are a scream."
Gilda,"Yeah [chuckles nervously] uh, good one, Pinkie Pie."
Rainbow Dash,"Come on G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends."
Gilda,Right behind you Dash. I know what you're up to.
Pinkie Pie,Great.
Gilda,Rrrh. I know what you're planning.
Pinkie Pie,"[giggles] Well, I hope so. This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party."
Gilda,"I mean, I've got my eye on you."
Pinkie Pie,"And I got my eye on you. Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash. Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie,Please help yourself.
Gilda,Vanilla lemon drops. Don't mind if I do. HOT!
Rainbow Dash,"G, the punch."
Gilda,[gasp] [gulp] Huh?
Pinkie Pie,"Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass."
Gilda,"[gulp] [gasp] Yeah, hilarious."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey G, look, presents."
Applejack,"Spittin' snakes. Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month."
Gilda,Ha ha. I bet I know who that was.
Pinkie Pie,You do?
Pinkie Pie,Cake time everypony.
Spike,"Hey, can I blow out the candles?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike? She is the guest of honor after all."
Spike,Ugh.
Spike,"[laughs] Re-lighting birthday candles, I love that prank. What a classic."
Pinkie Pie,"Now, I wonder who could've done that."
Gilda,"Yeah, I wonder."
Spike,"Mmm, who cares. This cake is amazing."
Twilight Sparkle,Spike.
Spike,"What? It's great, try some."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?"
Gilda,"No way, Dash. Like I said, I'm down with a good prank."
Rainbow Dash,"Come on then, let's have some cake."
Gilda,"Hey, I'm watching you. Like a hawk."
Pinkie Pie,Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?
Applejack,"Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony. Let's play."
Rarity,"Oh, my favorite game. Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail?"
Gilda,"Well, I am the guest of honor, and I'll have the purple tail."
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded."
Gilda,Hey what-- ugh-- what are you doing? Rrrah.
Pinkie Pie,We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.
Gilda,"[mockingly] Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail. Hmph, yeah, right. This is another prank, isn't it? I'm going this way."
Pinkie Pie,Wait. The poster is this--
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end."
Gilda,"[roar] This is your idea of a good time? I've never met a lamer bunch of dweebs in all my life. And Pinkie Pie, you! You are queen lame-o with your weak little party pranks. Did you really think you could make me lose my cool? Well, Dash and I have ten times as much cool as the rest of you put together. Come on Dash, we're bailing on this pathetic scene. Come on Rainbow Dash. I said, we're leaving."
Rainbow Dash,"You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party."
Gilda,[gasp] What?
Pinkie Pie,Ooh.
Rainbow Dash,So I guess I'm queen lame-o.
Gilda,"Come on, Dash, you're joshing me."
Rainbow Dash,"They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off."
Pinkie Pie,"I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it."
Gilda,"No way. It was Pinkie Pie. She set up this party to trip me up, to make a fool of me."
Pinkie Pie,Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.
Rainbow Dash,"And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends. If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else."
Rainbow Dash,Not cool.
Spike,"Wow, talk about a party pooper."
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, what was that about?"
Merry May,"Um, what just happened?"
Pony,Really awkward.
Rainbow Dash,"I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here. I didn't know how rude she was. And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her."
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business."
Rainbow Dash,I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings?
Pinkie Pie,No hard feelings.
Twilight Sparkle,Hey Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you.
Pinkie Pie,"It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish."
Twilight Sparkle,"Dearest Princess Celestia,"
Others,"Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and one who's true will surely come to light."
Others,"Your faithful student,"
Others,Twilight Sparkle
Princess Celestia,"Dear Twilight Sparkle,"
Spike,"Come on, Twilight. You can do it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, here goes."
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go."
Spike,"Wait! Aw, rats!"
Spike,"Twenty-five, Twilight. Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting. I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents!"
Twilight Sparkle,"True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?"
Spike,"Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me."
Spike,"Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight."
Snails,Gangway! Comin' through!
Spike,"Augh! Snips, Snails! What's goin' on?"
Snails,"Wha, haven't you heard?"
Spike,Whoa!
Snails,There's a new unicorn in town!
Snips,Yeah! They say that she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever!
Twilight Sparkle,Really?
Spike,"Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here."
Twilight Sparkle,Where is this unicorn?
Snails,"Ho, she's in the town square. Come on!"
Snips,Yeah! [laughter] Come on! Whooo!
Trixie,"Come one, come all! Come and witness the amazing magic of the Great and Powerful Trixie!"
Audience,Ooh!
Trixie,Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes!
Rarity,"My, my, my! What boasting!"
Spike,"Come on, nopony's as magical as Twi<U+0097> Twi<U+0097> Twi<U+0097> Oh! [clears throat] Hey, Rarity, I, uh<U+0097> Mustache!"
Twilight Sparkle,"There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?"
Applejack,"Nothin' at all, 'cep'n when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons."
Rarity,Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.
Rainbow Dash,"Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us. [laughter] Eh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. Boo!"
Trixie,"Well, well, well, it seems we have some neighsayers in the audience. Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie? Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?"
Rarity,[raspberry] Just who does she think she is?
Spike,Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Shhh!
Spike,What? What's wrong?
Twilight Sparkle,You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off.
Rainbow Dash,"So, ""Great and Powerful Trixie"". What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?"
Trixie,"Heh, why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major!"
Audience,Ahh!
Snips,What?
Snails,No way!
Trixie,"When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington had no one to turn to, but the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in, and with her awesome magic, vanquished the ursa major and sent it back to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest!"
Snips and Snails,"Saw, sweet!"
Snips,That settles it.
Snails,"Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awesome unicorn in Ponyville."
Snips,"No, in all of Equestria!"
Spike,"How do you know? You didn't see it! And besides, Twi<U+0097> [zip!] Mmph! M-mmph!"
Trixie,"[laughter] It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers. Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville."
Trixie,"Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie? [chuckles] Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians. Anything you can do, I can do better. Any takers? Anyone? Hmm? Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived!?"
Twilight Sparkle,"There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially since<U+0097>"
Trixie,"Hmm, how about you?"
Trixie,"Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?"
Twilight Sparkle,I<U+0097> I<U+0097>
Trixie,"Well, little hayseed?"
Applejack,That's it! I can't stand for no more of this!
Spike,"You show her, AJ!"
Applejack,Can your magical powers do this?
Applejack,"Top that, missy."
Trixie,Oh ye of little talent. Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie!
Applejack,Whoa! Uh!
Trixie,"Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails."
Rainbow Dash,There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.
Trixie,Oh?
Rainbow Dash,That's my job!
Rainbow Dash,"They don't call me ""Rainbow"" and ""Dash"" for nothin'!"
Trixie,"When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser."
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-a-a-a! [gulp] I think I'm [gulp] gonna be sick.
Trixie,Seems like anypony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie.
Rainbow Dash,Ow!
Spike,What we need is another unicorn to challenge her. Someone with some magic of her own.
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.
Applejack,A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.
Twilight Sparkle,Uh...
Rarity,"Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace."
Trixie,"Ooo, what's the matter? Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane?"
Rarity,"Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn needs to have style."
Audience,Ooh!
Rarity,A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
Spike,"Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she's<U+0097>"
Rarity,Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair!
Twilight Sparkle,Nothing.
Rainbow Dash,It's fine.
Applejack,It's gorgeous.
Spike,It's green. What?
Golden Harvest,"Well, I never!"
Spike,"Well Twilight, guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of."
Twilight Sparkle,What do you mean? I'm nothing special.
Spike,"Yes, you are! You're better than her!"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm not better than anyone.
Trixie,"Hah! You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie? You think you have more magical talent? Well, come on, show Trixie what you've got. Show us all."
Twilight Sparkle,"Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go."
Spike,Twilight?
Trixie,"Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria. Huh, was there ever any doubt?"
Snips,"Here's your smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it."
Snails,"Mmm, hay."
Trixie,[sips] Yes?
Snips,"Ooo, tell us another story, Great and Powerful Trixie."
Snails,"Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major."
Trixie,Guh! Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination. Begone with you until morning.
Snails,"Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie."
Snips,Anything you say. We are at your beck and call.
Trixie,Ah.
Spike,What are you two doin'?
Snips,Just bringin' the Gee an' Pee Tee a<U+0097>
Spike,The what?
Snips,The Great and Powerful Trixie.
Spike,Sheesh.
Snips,Just bringin' her a smoothie.
Spike,"How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-off. Unlike Twilight, who<U+0097>"
Snips,The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an ursa major. Can your Twilight claim that?
Spike,Oh really? Were you guys actually there?
Snips,"Well, eh, uh... no, but<U+0097>"
Spike,But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding.
Snails,[laughs] I like pudding.
Spike,"Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says, and neither should you!"
Snips,"Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hey? Snails! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Snails,Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas?
Snips,"Yeah, uh... oh, come on!"
Spike,"Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends."
Spike,"It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends!"
Twilight Sparkle,"No, Spike, it's exactly the same."
Spike,"Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie."
Twilight Sparkle,I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie.
Spike,But you're the best!
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh. Please, Spike, I said no!"
Spike,"[sighs] If that's the way you want to be, then fine."
Snips,"Oh, how we gonna find an ursa major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?"
Snips,"Oh, heh. That's better."
Snails,Yaaaah!
Snips,Yaaaah!
Spike,"Hey, guys, where ya goin'?"
Snips,Can't talk now.
Snails,Got a major problem!
Snips,"Yeah, ursa major, to be exact."
Spike,Huh?
Snips and Snails,Trixie!
Spike,Twilight!
Trixie,Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed!
Snips,[nervous laughter] We<U+0097> We have a<U+0097> a tiny problem.
Snails,"Actually, it's a big one."
Trixie,What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?
Spike,Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!
Twilight Sparkle,"I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie!"
Spike,"No, you don't understand, it's<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, is that what I think it is?"
Spike,Majorly.
Snips,"Great and Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa."
Snails,"Yeah, vanquish so we can watch."
Snips,It took a lot of trouble to get that thing here.
Trixie,"Wait, you brought this here? [gasp] Are you out of your little pony minds?"
Snips,"But, you're the Great and Powerful Trixie."
Snails,"Yeah, remember? You defeated an ursa major."
Trixie,"Uh, okay. [gulp] Stand back."
Trixie,Heh. Piece of cake.
Snips,"Aw, come on, Trixie."
Snails,"Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh?"
Snails,"Well, that was a dud."
Snips,"Yeah, pfft, come on! Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier? You know."
Trixie,Uh-oh.
Twilight Sparkle,What's going on?
Snips,We brought an ursa to town.
Twilight Sparkle,You what!?!
Snails,"Don't worry, the Great and Powerful Trixie will vanquish it."
Trixie,I can't.
Snips and Snails,What!?
Trixie,"Oh, I can't, I never have. No one can vanquish an ursa major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better."
Snips and Snails,Made it up!?
Spike,Nice use of number sixteen.
Unidentified cow,"Golly, dont'cha know?"
Spike,That's new.
Rainbow Dash,Unbelievable!
Spike,That was amazing!
Applejack,"Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me."
Others,"Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Hate you?"
Rarity,"Why, whatever do you mean, darling?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought--"
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth."
Rarity,Most unpleasant.
Applejack,All hat and no cattle.
Twilight Sparkle,"So, you don't mind my magic tricks?"
Applejack,"Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend."
Rainbow Dash,"And after whuppin' that ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder."
Twilight Sparkle,You are?
Rainbow Dash,Uh-huh.
Applejack,Mm-hmm.
Rarity,Mm-hmm.
Spike,"Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major?"
Twilight Sparkle,That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.
Spike,So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself?
Twilight Sparkle,"That wasn't an ursa major. It was a baby, an ursa minor."
Trixie,That was just a baby?
Twilight Sparkle,And it wasn't rampaging. It was just cranky because someone woke it up.
Snips and Snails,Awww...
Spike,"Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like?"
Twilight Sparkle,You don't wanna know.
Trixie,"Huh. You may have vanquished an ursa minor, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie!"
Rainbow Dash,"Why, that little..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two."
Snips,"Ah [nervous laughter]. Uh, we're sorry that we woke up the ursa minor."
Snails,We just wanted to see some awesome magic.
Snips,Yeah! And the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome!
Snails,We deserve whatever punishment you give us.
Twilight Sparkle,"For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five?"
Spike,"Oh, twenty five! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too."
Snips and Snails,Heah?
Twilight Sparkle,I think you're right.
Others,"Snips, Snails, Sweet!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: I was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends."
Spike,"So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?"
Spike,"Eh, she didn't go for the mustache."
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself."
Spike,Or... Maybe the mustache wasn't enough. Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard?
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, not this again!"
Spike,"Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Oh, no, a soul patch right on my chin!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, goodness. Are you okay?"
Fluttershy,Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?
Fluttershy,Because you need some water?
Fluttershy,[gasp] Because of that giant cloud of scary black smoke? I'll take that as a... yes.
Rainbow Dash,"Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me, future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder. Three forty six, three forty seven..."
Pinkie Pie,This calls for a celebration!
Fluttershy,"Oh, no, Pinkie Pie, this is no time for celebration. This is a time for panic, for--"
Pinkie Pie,Ooo! I'm going to need balloons! One for every pony in Ponyville!
Fluttershy,"There's-- there's smoke. And-- and where there's smoke, there's fire. And--"
Pinkie Pie,"Let's see, that's one, two, three, four..."
Rainbow Dash,Three hundred fifty four...
Pinkie Pie,"Five, six..."
Rainbow Dash,"Three hundred fifty five, no, wait..."
Pinkie Pie,Seven.
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over.
Fluttershy,"We're all going to have to start over, in a new village. 'Cause ours is gonna be--"
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Rainbow Dash, wait up!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, please, this is an emergency. I-I need everypony to--"
Twilight Sparkle,Listen up! Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria.
Ponies,What? Oh no! That's awful!
Fluttershy,That's what I've been trying to--
Twilight Sparkle,"But don't worry, I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire."
Fluttershy,"Oh, thank goodness."
Twilight Sparkle,It's coming from a dragon.
Fluttershy,A... d-dragon?
Applejack,What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in Equestria?
Twilight Sparkle,Sleeping.
Others,"Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Fluttershy, Huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,"According to Princess Celestia, he's taking a nap. His snoring is what's causing all this smoke."
Pinkie Pie,He should really see a doctor. That doesn't sound healthy at all.
Rarity,"Well, at least he's not snoring fire. What are we meant to do about it?"
Rainbow Dash,I'll tell you what we're meant to do. Give him the boot. Take that. And that!
Twilight Sparkle,"We need to encourage him to take a nap somewhere else. Princess Celestia has given us this mission, and we must not fail. If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years."
Rarity,Hmph. Talk about getting your beauty sleep.
Twilight Sparkle,"All right everypony, I need you to gather supplies quickly. We've got a long journey ahead of us. Let's meet back here in less than an hour."
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, girls, you heard her. The fate of Equestria is in our hooves. Do we have what it takes?"
Fluttershy,"Um, actually..."
Rainbow Dash,Raaah!
Applejack,Yaaa!
Pinkie Pie,"[laughter] Oh, I mean, grrr!"
Rarity,Ewww! Much better. Onward!
Applejack,Let's go!
Twilight Sparkle,"All right girls, listen up. I'm mapping out the fastest route, but we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall."
Fluttershy,M-m-mountain?
Twilight Sparkle,The dragon is in that cave at the very top.
Applejack,Looks pretty cold up there.
Rainbow Dash,"You bet it is. The higher you go, the chillier it gets."
Rarity,Good thing I brought my scarf.
Pinkie Pie,Ooo! Pretty!
Rainbow Dash,"Heh, oh yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy."
Fluttershy,"[gulp] Um, excuse me, Twilight? I know you're busy, but..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh-huh. Well, we could go this way."
Fluttershy,But if I could just have a second...
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh-huh. No, we want to avoid that."
Fluttershy,"So, um, I was thinking that, um, maybe I should just stay here in Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-huh.
Fluttershy,Oh! Good. I'll stay here and--
Twilight Sparkle,Wait! You have to come! Your way with wild animals will surely come in handy.
Fluttershy,I don't think I--
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, and don't worry about your little friends in the meadow. Spike's got it covered while you're gone."
Spike,You can count on me! Oooh! Hey! Hey! Wait!
Fluttershy,I don't really think he's up to the task. Maybe... But... But... no!
Rainbow Dash,"Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along? I mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow. She's just going to slow us down."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, she's just a little nervous. Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine."
Twilight Sparkle,"All right girls, move out!"
Rainbow Dash,Whoa. What was that?
Twilight Sparkle,That is what it sounds like when a dragon snores.
Fluttershy,It-- it's so... high!
Rainbow Dash,"Well, it is a mountain. I'm going to fly up there and check it out! Wah!"
Applejack,"Hold on, now. I think we should all go up together. Safety in numbers and all."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, all right."
Rarity,"I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests. Ooo, if I play my cards right, I might be able to convince him to part with a few!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Girls! This is no laughing matter! Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures. What do you think the dragon will be like? Fluttershy?"
Rainbow Dash,Hey! What are you waiting for? An invitation?
Pinkie Pie,"Ooo, I think I have one in my bag!"
Fluttershy,I-it's so... so... steep.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, it is a cliff. You could just, oh, I don't know, fly up here?"
Pinkie Pie,"Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it. Flap those wings!"
Rainbow Dash,Ugh.
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, we don't have time for this. What are you doing?"
Applejack,I'll need this if I'm going to take her around the mountain another way.
Rainbow Dash,[groan] Around the mountain? That's going to take them forever.
Applejack,"Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety-split."
Pinkie Pie,Whoo-hoo! I win again!
Rarity,Ugh. That's thirty-five games in a row. Best of seventy-one?
Rainbow Dash,Told you it was going to take them forever.
Twilight Sparkle,"Your turn, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,But... it's so... wide.
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, Fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now."
Applejack,You could just leap on over.
Fluttershy,I--
Fluttershy,I don't know.
Pinkie Pie,"There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a hop, skip and a jump. See?"
Pinkie Pie,"It's not very far Just move your little rump You can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump"
Twilight Sparkle,We don't have time for this.
Pinkie Pie,"A hop, skip and jump, Just move your little rump, A hop, skip and jump, A hop, skip and jump, A hop, skip and jump, A hop skip and jump, A hop skip and jump!"
Fluttershy,O-okay. Here I go. A hop.
Applejack,That's it.
Twilight Sparkle,You've got it.
Rarity,Almost there.
Fluttershy,Skip.
Twilight Sparkle,Just don't look down.
Rainbow Dash,Ugh.
Fluttershy,I guess I forgot to jump.
Twilight Sparkle,"[whispers] Let's keep it down. According to my map, we're entering an avalanche zone. The smallest peep could cause a huge rock slide."
Fluttershy,An... an ava... ava...
Twilight Sparkle,Shhh!
Fluttershy,AVALA--!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh no! Help! Ooh!
Applejack,Oh my! [stops coughing] Everypony okay?
Twilight Sparkle,Thanks to you I am.
Rarity,Eugh. Blech.
Pinkie Pie,Whoo-hoo! Let's do it again!
Rarity,"Uh! This is why a girl always packs extra accessories. Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes."
Fluttershy,[sigh] Sorry.
Applejack,"Aw, no big whoop, sugarcube."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, we'll just have to [sigh] climb over."
Applejack,Wha! Wha...
Rarity,My apologies.
Rainbow Dash,Not your fault.
Rainbow Dash,[sigh] Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?
Twilight Sparkle,"We're about to find out. We're here. Rainbow Dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke."
Rainbow Dash,Mm-hmm.
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity and Pinkie Pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there."
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. Is everypony ready?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay then, we're goin' in. So, what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him? Fluttershy? Oh, come on! Come on! [grunt] We have to do this! [grunt] Now! Every [grunts] second longer that dragon [grunts] sleeps is another [grunts] acre of Equestria that is covered in [grunts] smoke. Ooh!"
Fluttershy,I-- I-- I can't go in the cave.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, great. She's scared of caves now, too."
Fluttershy,"I'm not scared of caves, I'm scared of [mumble]."
Applejack,"What's that, sugarcube?"
Fluttershy,I'm scared of [mumble].
Twilight Sparkle,What?
Fluttershy,I'm scared of dragons!
Twilight Sparkle,But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals.
Fluttershy,"Yes, because they're not dragons."
Rainbow Dash,Oh come on! We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.
Fluttershy,"Yes, because he wasn't a dragon."
Pinkie Pie,Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.
Fluttershy,"Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!"
Twilight Sparkle,"But, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here?"
Fluttershy,I was afraid to.
Rainbow Dash,Ugh.
Applejack,All of us are scared of that dragon.
Rainbow Dash,I'm not!
Applejack,"Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do. So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of."
Fluttershy,I-- I-- I just... can't.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Fluttershy."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm goin' in. He... probably just doesn't realize what he's doing... right?
Twilight Sparkle,Mr. Dragon.
Twilight Sparkle,Excuse me.
Twilight Sparkle,Mr. Dragon.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, good, you're awake. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Twilight--"
Twilight Sparkle,"Augh! Puh! Sparkle, and my friends and I are residents here in Equestria. Ponyville, to be exact. We've come here to ask that you find another spot to take your nap. It's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring, and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke. [coughs] Equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze. You understand, don't you?"
Rainbow Dash,So much for [coughs] persuading him.
Applejack,Now what?
Rarity,"[coughs] Obviously, this situation just calls for a little ""pony charm"". Allow me, girls. I'm so sorry to interrupt. [clears throat] But I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have. And those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years?"
Rarity,"Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off. Hmm. Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone."
Rarity,I was this close to getting that diamond.
Twilight Sparkle,You mean... getting rid of that dragon?
Rarity,"Oh, yeah... sure."
Applejack,What in tarnation...?
Rarity,"Darling, you look ridiculous."
Pinkie Pie,Exactly! Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side! Hi!
Pinkie Pie,"Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh. Or sharing."
Rainbow Dash,"All right, that's it. We tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is Pinkie Pie does."
Rainbow Dash,It's time to stop wasting time! I'm going in!
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow, no!"
Rainbow Dash,Heh. Sorry.
Rainbow Dash,Who-o-o-o-o-a!
Ponies,Ugh!
Fluttershy,"How dare you... How dare you! Listen here, mister. Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully! You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire. But you do not-- I repeat-- You do not! Hurt! My! Friends! You got that?"
Fluttershy,Well?
Razer,But that rainbow one kicked me.
Fluttershy,"And I am very sorry about that. But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better. You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures."
Razer,But I--
Fluttershy,"Don't you 'but I' me, mister. Now what do you have to say for yourself? I said, what do you have to say for yourself?"
Fluttershy,"There, there. No need to cry. You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision. Now go pack your things. You just need to find a new place to sleep. That's all."
Twilight Sparkle,You did it! I knew you could do it.
Spike,[pant] I said come back here! Ooh! How does Fluttershy put up with you furry little things?
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, take a letter."
Spike,[sigh] With pleasure.
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, Fluttershy, who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears."
Others,"Always your faithful student,"
Others,Twilight Sparkle.
Applejack,Twilight! You gotta come see this! She's just five away from a new pony record!
Rainbow Dash,"Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight..."
Rainbow Dash,Dragon!
Rainbow Dash,[pants] Why are you laughing? That awful dragon is back!
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie, you scared me! I mean, uh, you... broke my concentration."
Rarity,Hmm. Hah! Perfect.
Applejack,"[spit] Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity. Don't y'all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'?"
Rarity,"Somepony has to. You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack."
Applejack,"Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony."
Rarity,I simply cannot imagine why the Pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.
Applejack,"[sigh] Think more practical-like, will ya? They accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all."
Rarity,Oh no! My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!
Applejack,Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.
Rarity,Oh! Ah! Oh! Ph! It's coming down too fast! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Help me!
Applejack,"Uh, there. Hunker down to yer heart's content whilst I finish things."
Rarity,"[pant] Oh, no, no, no!"
Applejack,What now?
Rarity,I prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
Applejack,"Guh. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there? Everything's got to be just so."
Rarity,"[scoff] Well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?"
Applejack,Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha.
Rarity,[laugh] That doesn't even make any sense.
Applejack,Does so.
Rarity,Does not.
Applejack,Does so.
Rarity,Does not.
Applejack,Does so.
Rarity,Does not.
Applejack,Does so infinity. Hah.
Rarity,Does not infinity plus one. Heh. What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret?
Applejack,I reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first.
Rarity,"On the contrary, I believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first."
Applejack,I'm not sayin' anythin'.
Rarity,Nor am I.
Applejack,"Y'all just be on yer way, then."
Rarity,After you!
Rarity,Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.
Applejack,"Uh-huh, perhaps we should. And fast."
Applejack,"Heh. Nice and dry under here, sorta."
Rarity,Oh! Unacceptable.
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack! Rarity! Applejack! Rarity!
Applejack and Rarity,Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,"Come inside girls, quick."
Applejack,"Whoa, nelly. Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?"
Twilight Sparkle,It is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like I do. Come on in!
Rarity,Hah! We are most grateful for your invitation.
Applejack,Thank ya kindly for yer hospitality.
Rarity,"Uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you?"
Applejack,"[grumble] If I gotta spend one more second with that fussbudget Rarity today, I can't be held responsible for what I'm gonna do."
Twilight Sparkle,"Some storm, huh? The Pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time. I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home."
Rarity,It may indeed be a problem.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, you're welcome to stay if need be. Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business. I'm home all alone tonight. [gasp] You and Applejack should totally sleep over! We'll have a slumber party! I've always wanted one of those."
Rarity,"Oh! Uh, goodness. Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now. [nervous laugh] Ah, silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night -- with Applejack. [reading] Slumber 101: All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask."
Twilight Sparkle,"My own personal copy. It's a fantastic reference guide. You should see the table of contents. I've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! This is gonna be so great!"
Applejack,"[gasp] What in tarnation... Now wait just a goll-darn minute. Ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over yer faces?"
Rarity,Silly! This is called a mud mask. It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.
Twilight Sparkle,"We're giving each other makeovers! Eee-hee! We have to do it, it says so in the book."
Applejack,"Slumber 101: Everything You... Oh hey, heh, would'ja look at the time. I gotta skidaddle on home quick. I'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'. Uh, g'night. [cry] Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell."
Twilight Sparkle,Hurray slumber party!
Applejack,Blahch. What in the world is this for?
Rarity,"[sigh] To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hee-hee! Isn't this exciting? We'll do everything by the book, and that will make my slumber party officially fun."
Rarity,"Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you?"
Applejack,"Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?"
Rarity,So do we have an agreement?
Rarity,"Oh! Gross! You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude."
Applejack,"You know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves."
Rarity,"Fortunately, I can get along with anypony, no matter how difficult she may be."
Applejack,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm the ""get-alongin-est"" pony you're ever gonna meet."
Rarity,That's not even a word.
Twilight Sparkle,This is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!
Applejack and Rarity,Yay.
Rarity,"So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?"
Applejack,"Just fine, Rarity."
Twilight Sparkle,"This is so awesome! [giggle] Makeovers, check. Ooh, it says here we have to tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?"
Applejack,Me! I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness. Oo-oo! I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one?
Rarity,"Never heard of it, but I have a much better one. It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated everypony within a hundred miles! Oo-oo!"
Applejack,That's not a real story. You made it up.
Rarity,"It is a ghost story, they're all made up."
Twilight Sparkle,"I've got one! This story is called The Legend of The Headless Horse. It was a dark and stormy night, just like this one. And three ponies were having a slumber party, just like this one..."
Twilight Sparkle,"...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her, just inches away was--The Headless Horse!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ghost story, check. Now, who wants s'mores?"
Twilight Sparkle,Ooo!
Rarity,[sigh] You could at least say excuse me.
Applejack,"Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me. Pardon."
Twilight Sparkle,"S'mores, check. Now the next item of fun we have to do is Truth or Dare."
Rarity,I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.
Applejack,"Oh yeah? Well I dare Rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change."
Rarity,I think the truth of the matter is that somepony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.
Applejack,And I think the truth is somepony oughta quit with her fussin' so the rest of us can get things done.
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, I don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. You have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever anypony dares you to do."
Applejack,"I dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again."
Twilight Sparkle,You have to. It's the rule.
Applejack,Hah!
Rarity,"Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a frou-frou, glittery, lacey outfit."
Applejack,[gasp] Happy?
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, do I ever get a turn?"
Applejack,I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town.
Rarity,I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.
Applejack,I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed.
Rarity,And I dare you to comb yours just once.
Twilight Sparkle,"I, uh, I think we should check off Truth or Dare and move on. Let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? Hm, what does this mean? Pillow fight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I get it! Pillow, fight! Fun! Ugh. Ah. Uh, girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch?"
Applejack,I will if she will.
Rarity,[gasp] She started it.
Twilight Sparkle,[spit] Maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep?
Rarity,Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.
Applejack,My hooves ain't muddy.
Rarity,They were. There might still be a little on them.
Applejack,There ain't. See?
Rarity,Eww!
Applejack,Now who's bein' inconsiderate?
Rarity,I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. Get up.
Applejack,Hey!
Rarity,"Ah ah ah! You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this. Mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah."
Applejack,"Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Geronimo!"
Rarity,Hey!
Applejack,Ah.
Rarity,You did that on purpose.
Applejack,"Um, yeah?"
Rarity,Get up so I can fix it again.
Rarity,M-mmm!
Applejack,I ain't budgin'.
Rarity,You will if you want any blankets.
Applejack,Give it back!
Rarity,I will not!
Applejack,"Yes, you will!"
Rarity,Won't!
Applejack,Will!
Rarity,Won't!
Applejack,Will!
Rarity,Won't!
Applejack,Will!
Twilight Sparkle,"Enough! It says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, and thanks to you two I can't check that off!"
Applejack,I've been tryin' my darndest to get along.
Rarity,"No, it is I who have been trying my best."
Applejack,"No, it was me."
Rarity,"No, it was I."
Applejack,Me!
Rarity,I!
Twilight Sparkle,"I hope you're happy, both of you. You've ruined my very first slumber party. The makeover, the s'mores, Truth or Dare, the pillow fight... I mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong?"
Twilight Sparkle,Sorry I asked.
Applejack,"Ya see? That's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up."
Rarity,But I--
Applejack,"Outta my way, missy! Time's a-wastin'."
Rarity,Wait! Stop! Don't!
Applejack,"No waitin'! No stoppin'! Doin'! And that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done."
Rarity,[cries] I tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here.
Applejack,"Well, ya shoulda tried harder. [sigh] I'm mighty sorry, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"It's... Well, it's not okay. There's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom, and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. Or at least I haven't found that entry yet. Ooh... ah!"
Applejack,What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?
Rarity,"Cleaning up this mess somepony made. Who was that again? Oh, right, that's you."
Applejack,We gotta do somethin'!
Twilight Sparkle,Baking... BFFs... Brothers... There's nothing in here about branches.
Applejack,"[grunts] Rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing! I said hussle over here and help me! Look, I'm sorry, all right?"
Rarity,What was that?
Applejack,"I said I'm sorry! I shoulda listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. Yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess. But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! Please!"
Rarity,"Uh. Uh, but I'll get all icky."
Applejack,"Consarnit! What the... eh... you... I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself. I need your help."
Rarity,Oh. Let's do this.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. Is that what we're doing right now? Does this count as camping?"
Rarity,"U-ugh. Oh, I look awful."
Applejack,Better?
Rarity,"Hmph, thanks."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, pretty! Where did these come from? They're not in the book either."
Applejack,Is it bigger than a barn?
Twilight Sparkle,[laugh] Nope.
Rarity,Is it smaller than a saddle?
Twilight Sparkle,[laugh] No! Only three of your twenty questions left!
Applejack,"[sigh] We're never gonna guess what you're thinkin' of, it could be anythin'."
Rarity,Are we getting warmer?
Twilight Sparkle,Why? Is it too cold in here for you? I can turn up the heat.
Applejack,She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh! No. And that technically counted as a question, so only two more left!"
Applejack,Is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?
Rarity,"Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?"
Twilight Sparkle,That's it!
Applejack and Rarity,It is?
Twilight Sparkle,"No. [chuckle] It's that. But it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along, I wanted you to be able to win together."
Twilight Sparkle,See? We could have been having fun like this all along.
Applejack,If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
Rarity,"Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy."
Applejack,Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.
Rarity,"Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse."
Applejack,"That's kind of ya to say, but I'm the one who's sorry."
Rarity,"Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are."
Applejack,Ugh. Are not.
Rarity,Are too.
Applejack,Are not!
Rarity,Are too.
Applejack,Are not.
Rarity,Are too.
Twilight Sparkle,I declare my first slumber party a success!
Twilight Sparkle,"Have fun, check."
Rarity,"Now take two steps to your left. Uh, no, my left."
Rarity,[laughter] Sorry.
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all."
Twilight Sparkle,"So, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? Ugh. How about a week from Thursday? Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday? A month from now?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, what a gorgeous day!"
Spike,Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away.
Twilight Sparkle,I bet all of Ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine. What? Where is everypony?
Spike,Is it some sort of pony holiday?
Twilight Sparkle,Not that I know of.
Twilight Sparkle,Not more than usual.
Spike,Is it... zombies?!
Twilight Sparkle,Uh... not very likely.
Spike,Not likely... but possible?
Pinkie Pie,Psst! Twilight! Spike! Come here! Come! Here! Hurry! Before she gets you!
Spike,Who?! The zombie pony?
Pinkie Pie,Z-Zombie pony?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike! There are no zombie ponies. Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?"
Pinkie Pie,I'm not alone in the dark.
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasp] Okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark?"
Applejack,We're hidin' from her!
Apple Bloom,Did you see her Twilight? Did you see... Zecora?
Applejack,Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I saw her glance this way..."
Pinkie Pie,Glance evilly this way.
Twilight Sparkle,... And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.
Applejack,"No good reason? You call protectin' yer kin no good reason? Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes."
Apple Bloom,[shakily] Did not!
Applejack,So I swept her up and brought her here.
Apple Bloom,I walked here myself!
Applejack,For safe keepin'.
Apple Bloom,"Applejack, I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself!"
Applejack,Not from that creepy Zecora.
Fluttershy,She's mysterious.
Rainbow Dash,Sinister.
Pinkie Pie,And spoooooky!
Twilight Sparkle,Will you cut that out?
Rarity,Just look at those stripes! So garish!
Twilight Sparkle,She's a zebra.
Everyone but Twilight,A what!?
Twilight Sparkle,"A zebra, and her stripes aren't a fashion choice Rarity, they're what she was born with."
Applejack,"Born where? I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept... her!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony. My books say that zebras come from a faraway land. But I've never seen her in Ponyville. Where does she live?"
Applejack,"That's just it, she lives in... the Everfree Forest!"
Twilight Sparkle,Spike!
Spike,"Uh, sorry."
Applejack,The Everfree Forest just ain't natural. The plants grow...
Fluttershy,Animals care for themselves...
Rainbow Dash,And the clouds move...
Others,"Applejack, Fluttershy, All on their own!"
Pinkie Pie,And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil... stuff! She's so evil I even wrote a song about her!
Rainbow Dash,Here we go...
Pinkie Pie,She's an evil enchantress She does evil dances And if you look deep in her eyes She'll put you in trances Then what will she do? She'll mix up an evil brew Then she'll gobble you up In a big tasty stew Soooo... Watch out!
Twilight Sparkle,Wow. Catchy.
Pinkie Pie,It's a work in progress.
Twilight Sparkle,This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors. Now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?
Rainbow Dash,"Well... Once a month, she comes into Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle,[dramatically] Oooooh.
Rarity,"Then, she lurks by the stores."
Twilight Sparkle,"[dramatically] Oh, my."
Fluttershy,"And then, she digs at the ground."
Twilight Sparkle,"[dramatically] Good gracious! [normal tone] Okay, I'm sorry. But how is any of this bad? Maybe she comes to town to visit?"
Apple Bloom,Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly.
Twilight Sparkle,"And maybe she's not lurking by the stores, maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping?"
Apple Bloom,Yeah! Everypony likes to shop. You know what I think?
Applejack,Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.
Apple Bloom,[under breath] I am a big pony!
Rainbow Dash,W-what about digging at the ground? You've got to admit that's weird.
Fluttershy,What if she's digging for innocent creatures?
Twilight Sparkle,"I am sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does. And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth."
Twilight Sparkle,You ponies are being ridiculous!
Pinkie Pie,"Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay."
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay!"
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay."
Applejack,Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?
Fluttershy,The door's open.
Rarity,She went outside!
Rainbow Dash,And Zecora's still out there.
Applejack,[sigh] That silly lil' filly! I told her to stay put!
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, you stay here in case Apple Bloom comes back."
Spike,Will do!
Applejack,Apple Bloom?
Applejack,You get back here right now!
Zecora,"Beware! Beware, you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!"
Applejack,"Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?"
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Oh brother.
Zecora,Beware! Beware!
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, back at ya, Zecora! You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!"
Applejack,And you! Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?
Apple Bloom,I...I...
Applejack,Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?
Twilight Sparkle,"You guys, there's no such thing as curses!"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself."
Twilight Sparkle,"My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with. Curses are artificial, fake magic. It's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare. But curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale."
Applejack,"Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true."
Pinkie Pie,"She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!"
Zecora,Beware! Beware!
Pinkie Pie,"If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!"
Rarity,"Wicked, wicked zebra!"
Fluttershy,... it's a curse.
Pinkie Pie,Then what will she do?
Applejack,"Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true."
Pinkie Pie,Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew! Soooo... Watch out!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh... what a dream... Curses, schmurses. Whoa! [chuckle] Maybe Zecora cursed my hair. [Laughs nervously and then gasps] Or she cursed my horn!"
Twilight Sparkle,No no no no no! None of these books have a cure! Ugh! There has to be a real reason for this! An illness? An allergy?!
Spike,A curse!
Twilight Sparkle,I said a real reason. Something that points to something real.
Spike,How about this one?
Twilight Sparkle,"""Supernaturals""? Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses. This book is just a bunch of hooey!"
Spike,"But what if you're wrong, Twilight? What if this really is a-"
Pinkie Pie,Ah pfurse!
Spike,A purse? How could it be a purse?
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie? What happened?
Pinkie Pie,Pee pah Zthecora! Sthe put a cursthe on me!
Spike,"Hey, say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!"
Rainbow Dash,[thud] Ow! [thud] Oh! She's [thud] trying to say-ow!- Zecora [thud]-oh!-[crash] she slapped us all with a-ow- curse!
Applejack,"[high pitched voice] I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!"
Applejack,"It's a curse, I tells ya!"
Twilight Sparkle,But Fluttershy... seems just fine!
Rarity,"Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her."
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you? Would you care to tell us? So... you're not going to tell us? Yes you're not, or yes you will?"
Applejack,"Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!"
Fluttershy,[deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it.
Spike,"This is hilarious! [laughs] Look at all of you! We got: Hairity, Rainbow Crash, Spitty Pie, Apple Teeny, Flutterguy, and... uh... I got nothin'... Twilight Sparkle. I mean seriously, I can't even work with that."
Twilight Sparkle,"[Sarcastic laughter] This is no joke, Spike. Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure!"
Rainbow Dash,[groans] I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!
Twilight Sparkle,It's not a curse!
Applejack,I agree with Dash! We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
Twilight Sparkle,It's not a hex either!
Apple Bloom,"This is all my fault. If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would have happened. I just gotta fix this."
Applejack,Now where does she think she's goin' this time?
Rainbow Dash,"I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to pony up and confront Zecora. Come on, girls. Are you with me?"
Pinkie Pie,Ah am-pft!
Rarity,And I as well.
Fluttershy,"Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous."
Rainbow Dash,"How about you, Applejack? Applejack?"
Pinkie Pie,Pf-she's gone-pft!
Rarity,Aah! Or somepony stepped on her!
Twilight Sparkle,... or sat on her?
Rainbow Dash,Rarity's hair!
Rarity,"Oh! OH! Pinkie, what are you doing? Ah, really. Aah! You ever hear of personal space?"
Pinkie Pie,Nopthe.
Twilight Sparkle,Apple Bloom is gone too!
Rainbow Dash,I bet they went after Zecora.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well we better go find them. Come on girls, let's go."
Rarity,"[grunt] Oh dear. Oh, this is so unseemly. Auuuaah!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, a little help here?"
Fluttershy,Oopsie! Sorry.
Rainbow Dash,[crash] OW!
Fluttershy,Uh... Spike? Are you coming?
Spike,Nope! Uh... gotta stay here and look for a cure. [gasp] Twilight Flopple!
Applejack,"Stop right there! Turn around right now, missy!"
Apple Bloom,No.
Applejack,No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!
Apple Bloom,"Hehehe. Sorry, Applejack, but I'm the big sister now."
Applejack,"Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant! I'm gonna tell Big McIntosh on you! Aw, pony feathers."
Twilight Sparkle,C'mon girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry!
Rarity,Ooh... Ahaha. Easier said than done.
Applejack,Rainbow! Thank Celestia! There's no time to lose! I need to get to Zecora's pronto! Giddy-up pony!
Rainbow Dash,Ex-CUSE me?
Applejack,YEEE-HAW!
Rainbow Dash,What the...
Applejack,"No, Rainbow Dash. Other way!"
Rarity,Oh. I look horrible!
Pinkie Pie,Plis place plooks horrible!
Rarity,"Oh my. That place really does look horrible. Nice decorations, if you like creepy!"
Pinkie Pie,Sthe sthtole my sthong! Shthe shtole mm mm!
Rarity,She stole your song?
Twilight Sparkle,Oh Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song.
Others,She's an evil enchantress And she does evil dances And if you look deep in her eyes She will put you in trances Then what would she do? She'll mix up an evil brew Then she'll gobble you up In a big tasty stew Soooo... Watch out.
Rarity,You saw those terrible things. Now do you believe us Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,"Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron? [sigh] Everything is pointing to Zecora being... bad. Or... what if Zecora is just making soup?"
Zecora,"Mmm! The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume. Now, where is that little Apple Bloom?"
Twilight Sparkle,Or... what if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!
Twilight Sparkle,What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!
Applejack,"I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!"
Rainbow Dash,Aaah!
Applejack,"Whoa there. Easy, Rainbow Crash."
Twilight Sparkle,What have you done with Apple Bloom?
Rainbow Dash,Ahh!
Zecora,Ponies! What is this you...
Zecora,No! You know not what you do! You've gone and spilled my precious brew!
Twilight Sparkle,"We're onto you Zecora. I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!"
Rarity,You made me look ridiculous.
Fluttershy,You made me sound ridiculous!
Pinkie Pie,[incoherent] You made me speak ridiculous!
Twilight Sparkle,You ruined my horn!
Zecora,"How dare you! You destroy my home, destroy my work, then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?"
Rainbow Dash,"You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us."
Zecora,It is unwise to venture down this road. Your actions will make my anger explode!
Twilight Sparkle,Where is Apple Bloom!?
Apple Bloom,Zecora! I think I found all the things ya asked for. What in Ponyville is goin' on here?
Applejack,[gasp] Apple Bloom! You're okay!
Apple Bloom,Why wouldn't I be?
Twilight Sparkle,Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!
Apple Bloom,Oh Twilight. Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head? You know there's no such thing as a curse.
Twilight Sparkle,"Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse."
Apple Bloom,This isn't a curse.
Zecora,"If you will remember back, the words I spoke were quite exact. [flashback]: Beware, beware you pony folk. Those leaves of blue are not a joke."
Apple Bloom,It was a warnin'. About that blue plant. It's called Poison Joke.
Zecora,That plant is much like poison oak. But its results are like a joke.
Applejack,What in the hay does that mean?
Zecora,It means this plant does not breed wrath. Instead this plant just wants a laugh.
Applejack,Will somepony please talk normal?
Twilight Sparkle,"I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke. All our problems are just little jokes it played on us."
Applejack,Little jokes?! Very funny.
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, fine. But what about the cauldron?"
Fluttershy,And the chanting?
Rarity,And the creepy d<e9>cor?
Zecora,"Treasures of the native land where I am from. This one speaks 'hello', and this 'welcome'."
Rarity,"Not welcoming at all, if you ask me."
Zecora,The words I chanted were from olden times. Something you call a nursery rhyme.
Twilight Sparkle,But the cauldron... The Apple Bloom soup?
Apple Bloom,"Lookie here Twilight. That pot of water wasn't for me, it was for all these herbal ingredients. The cure for poison joke is a simple old-natural remedy. You just gotta take a bubble bath!"
Twilight Sparkle,But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?
Zecora,"Here is the book, you see? Sad that you lack it in your library."
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, I do have this book, but I didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird. Supernaturals: Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super. I...I... I'm so sorry, Zecora. I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside."
Zecora,"[chuckle] Maybe next time you will take a second look, and not judge the cover of the book."
Apple Bloom,Hahaha.
Twilight Sparkle,Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?
Zecora,Mix it up I certainly will. Yet I am missing an herb from Ponyville.
Apple Bloom,"But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, well... I think we can help you with that."
Daisy,Look Rose! How awful!
Rose,The wicked enchantress has cursed them all.
Lily Valley,"The horror, the horror!"
Daisy,"Run, ponies! Run!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Daisy, we need to talk."
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"My friends and I all learned an important lesson this week: Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your ""cover"" is; it's the ""contents"" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever."
Others,"Your faithful student,"
Others,Twilight Sparkle
Lotus Blossom,"Miss Zecora, I would love to get the recipe for this bath. It's simply luxurious!"
Apple Bloom,"Applejack! Hey, where's Applejack?!"
Applejack,"[normal voice] I'm right here, little sis. I ain't tiny no more!"
Rarity,Oh! I have never felt so lovely in all my life!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, my gosh! I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk. I mean, I love talking so much, and when I couldn't talk anymore, my tongue was all 'ehhhh'! It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy,[normal voice] ... Yes.
Fluttershy,"La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la."
Fluttershy,Gah!
Fluttershy,"Hello, little guy. I've never seen anything like you before."
Fluttershy,"Oh, are you hungry? Here you go. [gasp] I guess you were hungry."
Fluttershy,You're the cutest thing ever! I can't wait to show you to my friends.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself."
Spike,It also didn't mess itself up.
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
Spike,I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.
Twilight Sparkle,"There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter."
Spike,"Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho! Aw."
Twilight Sparkle,Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.
Spike,"You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet."
Twilight Sparkle,"Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming."
Twilight Sparkle,What happened to the rest of her name?
Golden Harvest,We couldn't fit it all in.
Twilight Sparkle,"You can't hang a banner that says ""Welcome Princess Celest"". Take it down and try again."
Twilight Sparkle,That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.
Twilight Sparkle,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming?"
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. Uh...it would be coming a little better if...
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.
Pinkie Pie,"I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess."
Fluttershy,"Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?"
Pinkie Pie,"No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home. [slurp] What's going on, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy,"You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay."
Fluttershy,[gasp] Three?
Twilight Sparkle,They're amazing. What are they?
Fluttershy,I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying."
Fluttershy,"Pinkie, do you want the other one?"
Pinkie Pie,Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding?
Fluttershy,Ugh?
Twilight Sparkle,A para-what?
Fluttershy,How could you not like...
Pinkie Pie,Ugh. Now I gotta go find a trombone.
Twilight Sparkle,A what?
Twilight Sparkle,"Ahhh, typical Pinkie."
Rarity,"Stand still, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy! This is waaay too boring for me."
Rarity,Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous."
Rarity,"Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents."
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, sooo boooring."
Rarity,Huh?
Rainbow Dash,"What's that sound, Twilight?"
Rainbow Dash,"Wow, what are they?"
Twilight Sparkle,"The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, I'll take one."
Rarity,"Me too, oh, they're perfect."
Pinkie Pie,Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
Pinkie Pie,Girls! Hello! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot.
Twilight Sparkle,"[sigh] The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, [yawn] what's there to worry about?"
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Wake up! What happened?
Spike,Huh? Whaaa! What's going on?
Twilight Sparkle,Where did they come from?
Spike,"I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!"
Twilight Sparkle,The princess will be here in a few hours.
Spike,Ugh.
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, help me round up these little guys."
Spike,"Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, ""stop fooling around""."
Rainbow Dash,Huh? Huh?! [screech] [grunt] [groan] Get off me! [groan] [grunt] Waaa!
Rarity,"Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful."
Rarity,Oh! Are you okay? Aaah! [gasp] Eewww. Aaah! Gross gross gross! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!
Pinkie Pie,"Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica. [plays harmonica] Isn't that great?"
Pinkie Pie,[gasp] And not a moment too soon.
Rarity,"Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now."
Pinkie Pie,"And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time."
Rarity,"Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem."
Pinkie Pie,"You've got a real problem, all right. And a banjo is the only answer!"
Rarity,[gasp] I see we're having the same problem.
Rainbow Dash,Ditto!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying."
Twilight Sparkle,...or not.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?"
Fluttershy,"I've tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and..."
Rainbow Dash,Guh.
Twilight Sparkle,"If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster."
Rarity,"Ew! If you ask me, it's already a total disaster."
Applejack,"Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. Hey!"
Fluttershy,What do we do?
Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] I got it! Nopony can herd like Applejack.
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.
Applejack,"[scoffs] I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away."
Rainbow Dash,Aye aye.
Applejack,Yeeeeeee-haw!
Applejack,"Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash! Hold on girls, we're almost there."
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, we don't have much time."
Twilight Sparkle,You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment.
Pinkie Pie,Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.
Twilight Sparkle,"Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas."
Pinkie Pie,"[gasp] You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me!"
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie, you are so random."
Pinkie Pie,And you are all so stubborn!
Applejack,Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out.
Fluttershy,Ouch.
Twilight Sparkle,"We did it. Nice work, Applejack."
Applejack,Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
Twilight Sparkle,Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time."
Twilight Sparkle,Where did they come from?
Fluttershy,"Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute."
Twilight Sparkle,We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?
Rainbow Dash,Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA!
Twilight Sparkle,"[grunt] Way to go, Rainbow Dash!"
Applejack,Looks like our problems are solved.
Pinkie Pie,They will be with these cymbals. [crash] Hey! Give me those back!
Rainbow Dash,Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Whoa! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up.
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, what have you done?"
Pinkie Pie,"I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done."
Twilight Sparkle,Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.
Pinkie Pie,"Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?"
Applejack,"Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel."
Pinkie Pie,Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you'd just slow down and listen to me!
Gardening pony,Aah!
Fluttershy,What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.
Applejack,[gasp] My apples!
Twilight Sparkle,We've gotta do something. [gasps] I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.
Rainbow Dash,"Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore."
Rarity,Oh no... if they get inside my store... Everypony for herself!
Pinkie Pie,I'll save you!
Applejack,No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.
Applejack,"Brace yourself, y'all, here they come. [gasp] Didn't see that one comin'."
Spike,Help!
Spike,Help...
Zecora,Ugh. Have you gone mad?
Twilight Sparkle,"Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?"
Zecora,"Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes?"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know! Is it?
Zecora,"Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed."
Twilight Sparkle,"[grunts] Oh no, here she comes."
Daisy,"Aaaah, aaaaaaah!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them."
Rainbow Dash,YAAAA!
Twilight Sparkle,"Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over!"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense?
Twilight Sparkle,Look.
Princess Celestia,"Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hello, princess."
Princess Celestia,"So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends."
Twilight Sparkle,So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic?
Princess Celestia,"Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable."
Rainbow Dash,They're not that adorable.
Princess Celestia,I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
Twilight Sparkle,"Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade."
Princess Celestia,"Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation."
Twilight Sparkle,An... infestation?
Princess Celestia,"Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble."
Twilight Sparkle,Trouble? What trouble?
Princess Celestia,"Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?"
Twilight Sparkle,My... report?
Princess Celestia,Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives..."
Twilight Sparkle,Even when they don't always seem to make sense.
Princess Celestia,"I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you, princess."
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, what happened to the princess?"
Twilight Sparkle,Emergency in Fillydelphia.
Rainbow Dash,Some sort of infestation.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel."
Twilight Sparkle,I think the princess can handle it.
Applejack,"So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you."
Twilight Sparkle,"We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen."
Twilight Sparkle,"You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you."
Pinkie Pie,"Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me."
Twilight Sparkle,"You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville."
Twilight Sparkle,...Or not.
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasp] Spike, wake up. Wake up, wake up, it's Winter Wrap Up day!"
Spike,Huh? Mommy?
Twilight Sparkle,Winter Wrap Up!
Spike,You're not mommy.
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow, so everypony in Ponyville needs to clean up winter. Now help me get ready."
Spike,Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter? Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot?
Spike,It's ridiculous. No magic... Fuh.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, let's see: scarf, check; saddle, check; boots, check; Spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check. It's a good thing I'm so organized, I'm ready. Bright and early. Oh... maybe a little too early."
Twilight Sparkle,"Those must be the team vests Rarity designed. Blue for the weather team, green for the plant team, and tan for the animal team. I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing."
Spike,"I'll take a blue vest, same color as my blankie, which I think I hear calling my name. ""Spike! Spike! Come to bed!"" Ugh, it's too early."
Mayor Mare,"Thank you, everypony, for being here bright and early. We need every single pony's help to wrap up winter, and bring in spring."
Mayor Mare,"Now, all of you have your vests, and have been assigned to your teams, so let's do even better than last year, and have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, this is so exciting."
Mayor Mare,"All right everypony, find your team leader, and let's get galloping!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh gosh, where should I go? I'm not sure where I fit in. What exactly does everypony do?"
Rainbow Dash,Three months of winter coolness And awesome holidays
Pinkie Pie,We've kept our hoovsies warm at home Time off from work to play
Applejack,But the food we've stored is runnin' out And we can't grow in this cold
Rarity,And even though I love my boots This fashion's getting old
Twilight Sparkle,"The time has come to welcome spring And all things warm and green But it's also time to say goodbye It's winter we must clean How can I help? I'm new, you see What does everypony do? How do I fit in without magic? I haven't got a clue!"

Twilight Sparkle,Everypony belongs to a team. What should I do? Where should I go?
Rainbow Dash,"All right team, you're clear for takeoff."
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, hey Twilight, what's up?"
Twilight Sparkle,What are you doing?
Rainbow Dash,Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, can I help? How about if I help clear out the clouds?"
Rainbow Dash,Um...
Twilight Sparkle,Right. No wings.
Rainbow Dash,"Sorry, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasp] Great, now what do we do?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on Spike, this is serious business. Winter needs to be wrapped up, and I'm determined to do my part. Somehow."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, please tell me there's something, anything I can help you with."
Rarity,"Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests?"
Twilight Sparkle,Birds' nests?
Rarity,"Why yes. When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs."
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Rarity, that one's really beautiful."
Rarity,"Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?"
Twilight Sparkle,Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?
Rarity,"Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. Now, weave them through there, yes. Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... I don't know I guess that would do... oh dear."
Twilight Sparkle,There! It looks just like... yours. Oh my.
Spike,That nest needs to be condemned.
Rarity,"Oh, Spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a..."
Spike,An outhouse?
Twilight Sparkle,Hw...
Spike,I think we lost her.
Rarity,"Ah, and we need to weave the string..."
Pinkie Pie,"Hellooooooo, Twilight! Wheeeeeeee!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Pinkie Pie, you're quite the skater. Probably the best skater I've ever seen."
Pinkie Pie,"Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie. Just comes natural. Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. I cut lines in the lakes with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie."
Twilight Sparkle,"How clever. When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you, there's quite a few lakes in Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie,"Ha, tell me about it. Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out?"
Twilight Sparkle,Would I?
Pinkie Pie,"Come on, put on those skates over there. I bet you'll be a natural too."
Twilight Sparkle,Okay.
Twilight Sparkle,Uh... maybe on second thought.
Spike,What are you talking about? You said you wanted to be helpful.
Pinkie Pie,Yippie!
Spike,Now get out there.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh no, whoa, wow..."
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, steer! Steer!"
Twilight Sparkle,Yaaaaa!
Pinkie Pie,Oh boy...
Spike,Pwuh.
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, you did a great job your first time around. I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours."
Twilight Sparkle,Really?
Pinkie Pie,No.
Pinkie Pie,But did I make you feel better?
Twilight Sparkle,"Mm-hmm, yeah, I guess."
Pinkie Pie,"I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hooves on the ground. I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well... I'm pretty good with little animals. Yeah, I'll go help her."
Pinkie Pie,"Uh... it's, ah, that a-way."
Twilight Sparkle,Yaaaaaa!
Fluttershy,"Wake up, little sleepy heads. Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming."
Twilight Sparkle,"Awww, how cute."
Fluttershy,"Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again."
Spike,"Uh, what's ""hibernation""?"
Fluttershy,It's like a long sleep.
Spike,Long sleep?
Fluttershy,"Yes. [bell rings] Wake up, little porcupines. Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food."
Spike,"I definitely like the idea of hibernation, uh, except for the ""eat less food"" part."
Fluttershy,"Oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens? I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'll help, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,"You will? Oh, that would be wonderful."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, let's start there."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hello? Wake up little friends, wherever you are. Spring is coming. [bell rings] I wonder which cute little furry creatures I've awoken."
Twilight Sparkle,Waaa! Snakes! Snakes! [scream] Ugh! [grunt] [scream] Ugh!
Fluttershy,"Good morning, friends."
Twilight Sparkle,[sigh] All this Winter Wrap Up stuff is a lot harder than it looks.
Spike,"[nasally] Right, because there's no magic. Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way?"
Twilight Sparkle,"No, Spike, I have to do it the traditional way. Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter."
Spike,"[nasally] Well, they never had you here before, either. Think how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic."
Applejack,"Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it, Bumpkin. I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Applejack. How's everything going?"
Applejack,"Oh, just dandy. A little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear, ya hear? We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow hightailed outta here."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'd like to help."
Applejack,"Well, I... I dunno Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,Just give me a chance.
Applejack,"Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but..."
Spike,Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
Twilight Sparkle,I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...
Applejack,Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.
Spike,"That's my girl, following my advice."
Applejack,And what in tarnation does that mean?
Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] Uh-oh. Slow down. Slow down!
Spike and Applejack,Whoa-oa-oa!
Applejack,"What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you?"
Applejack,"Nuts, Twilight, you used magic."
Spike,The nerve. Can you believe her?
Applejack,"That's not how we do it 'round here, Twilight, and especially not on MY FARM!"
Spike,"Come on, Twilight. Come on out."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm a winter mess up.
Spike,"Well you're good at a lot of things, just not nest-making, ice-skating, animal-waking, snow-clearing."
Twilight Sparkle,[whine] Thanks a lot for making me feel so much better.
Spike,"That's what I'm here for, sister."
Applejack,"Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto."
Rainbow Dash,Got it.
Fluttershy,Wait. My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.
Rainbow Dash,Got it.
Applejack,"I'm tellin' you, Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now."
Fluttershy,"No, you simply must wait."
Rainbow Dash,Okay.
Applejack,Go.
Fluttershy,Stop.
Applejack,Go.
Fluttershy,Stop.
Applejack,GO!
Fluttershy,STOP!
Rainbow Dash,Ugh! Make up your minds!
Mayor Mare,"Oh! What in Equestria are all you arguing about? This sort of silliness is why we were late for spring last year, and the year before that, and the year before that."
Twilight Sparkle,Did she say late?
Mayor Mare,"I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech would urge everyone to do better than last year, but now it looks like we're going to be later than ever. I mean just look at this catastrophe. The ice scorers made the ice chunks too big to melt. The nest designer is horrendously behind, we need several hundred, and she's only made one."
Mayor Mare,"And don't get me started on all the clouds in the sky, the icicles on the trees... This isn't good, not at all!"
Applejack,And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.
Rainbow Dash,"Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can."
Fluttershy,"No, not fast, we have to wake animals slowly."
Big McIntosh,"Uh, AJ?"
Applejack,"Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Rainbowshine,[grunt] Ditzy Doo accidentally went north to get the southern birds!
Rainbow Dash,Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?
Mayor Mare,Stop this at once. We don't have time to argue. It's almost sundown. Spring is going to be late again. Another year of scandal and shame. If only we could be more organized.
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard, STAT!"
Spike,"Eh, yes, ma'am."
Twilight Sparkle,"Stop, everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle,Stop!
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry. I know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it. What you need is organization, and I'm just the pony for the job."
Mayor Mare,I can't believe it. Spring is here! On time! And we have you to thank for it. If it weren't for your organizing skills we would still be arguing.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Twilight Sparkle,It was a team effort.
Mayor Mare,"And since you helped every team, we have an official vest for you. We give you the title, ""All-Team Organizer""."
Twilight Sparkle,"Gosh, I don't even know what to say. Thank you, everypony."
Mayor Mare,And hereby I declare that winter is... wrapped up on time.
Applejack,Spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprised when that last piece a' ice melts.
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville. It helped me to learn we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them, and as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything. How's that, Spike? Spike?"
Cheerilee,Let's quiet down please. We have a very important lesson to get to. [class quiets down] Thank you. Today we are going to be talking about cutie marks.
Cheerilee,"You can all see my cutie mark, can't you? Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark. My flank was blank."
Twist,Aww...! She's so precious!
Cheerilee,"Then one day, when I was about your age, I woke up to find that a cutie mark had appeared."
Cheerilee,"Yes I know, but honestly, that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then. I had decided to become a teacher, and the flowers symbolized my hope that I could help my future students bloom if I nurture them with knowledge. The smiles represented the cheer I hope to bring to my little ponies while they were learning. Now, can anyone tell me when a pony gets his or her cutie mark?"
Twist,Oh! Oh! Oh! When she discovers that certain something that makes her special!
Cheerilee,"That's right, Twist. A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank when he or she finds that certain something that makes them different from every other pony. Discovering what makes you unique isn't something [Diamond Tiara: Pssst!] that happens overnight, and no amount of hoping, wishing, [Diamond Tiara: Pssst!] or begging, would make a cutie mark appear before its time."
Diamond Tiara,Pssst!
Apple Bloom,What?!
Cheerilee,Apple Bloom! Are you passing a note?
Apple Bloom,"Uh, I... Um..."
Cheerilee,What could be so important that it couldn't wait until after class? [gasp] It's blank.
Twist,Want some sweets? I've got some peppermint sticks. I made them myself.
Apple Bloom,Mm-mm.
Twist,They'll make you smi-i-le.
Apple Bloom,No...
Diamond Tiara,"I don't know why we had to sit through a lecture about getting a cutie mark. I mean, waiting for your cutie mark is sooo last week. You got yours, I just got mine. We all have them already. [gasp] I mean, almost all of us have them already. Don't worry, you two, you're still totally invited to my cute-cea<f1>era this weekend."
Silver Spoon,It's going to be amazing.
Diamond Tiara,It's a party celebrating me and my fantastic cutie mark. How could it not be?
Apple Bloom,Gimme a break.
Silver Spoon,See you this weekend...
Apple Bloom,It's not fair! It's just not fair!
Applejack,Don't get your mane in a tangle. You'll get your cutie mark. Everypony gets one eventually.
Apple Bloom,"But I don't want one eventually! I want one right now! I can't go to Diamond Tiara's cute-cea<f1>era without one, I just can't!"
Applejack,"'Course you can. Y'know, I was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and I couldn't be prouder of it. I knew my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal. [gasp] Come to think of it, Granny Smith was the last one in her class, too. Huh, same as Big McIntosh."
Apple Bloom,"I really don't see how that's supposed to make me feel better. It probably means that being the last one in your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family. ...runs in the family. Runs in the family! Runs in the family! You've got apples for your cutie mark, Granny Smith has an apple pie, Big McIntosh has an apple half, my unique talent must has som'n to do with apples! Apples apples apples! [crash] Oops... apples."
Applejack,"Get your delicious, nutritious apples here!"
Apple Bloom,Create fine art for your home with 'em. You have to be crazy not to get a bushel of your very own.
Applejack,"Heh... she's so creative, heh."
Apple Bloom,"You, sir, care t' buy some apples?"
Dr. Hooves,Dr. No thanks.
Apple Bloom,Why not?
Dr. Hooves,Dr. I have plenty at home.
Apple Bloom,Are you sure?
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Yes, I'm pretty sure I..."
Apple Bloom,"You're pretty sure, but you're not absolutely positively completely super-duper sure, are you?"
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Y...ah... If I buy some apples, will you please leave me alone?"
Apple Bloom,All right!
Applejack,You forgot your change!
Apple Bloom,"Woo-hoo! That's how you sell s'm apples and get a cutie mark! So, what does my cutie mark look like? A shoppin' bag full of apples? A satisfied customer eating an apple? Hmm... maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first. You touch it, you buy it! We take cash or credit."
Applejack,"I'm sorry, ma'am. Ma'am! Aww... Now Apple Bloom, you can't just..."
Apple Bloom,That'll be four bits.
Sweetie Drops,I didn't put those in my bag.
Apple Bloom,"Likely story. Four bits, lady!"
Applejack,"Apple Bloom! I am really really sorry about that. She's new. Here, take these. No charge. And these. And these."
Applejack,"Y'all come back now, y'hear?"
Apple Bloom,What?
Applejack,"Sorry, little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over."
Apple Bloom,What? But how else am I gonna get my cutie mark?
Applejack,Home. Now.
Apple Bloom,Hm!
Applejack,"Ugh. Listen, sugarcube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it. Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet. Ain't there other fillies in your class without one?"
Apple Bloom,Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet.
Applejack,Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?
Apple Bloom,Mmm-hmm.
Applejack,Well there you go. Bet you and Twist would have a great time together. Now run along and find your friend.
Apple Bloom,You're sure you don't want me to stick around 'til the end of th' market?
Ace Point,Hey! Who's been using my racket?
Applejack,Yeah. I'm sure.
Twist,"Oh, what's up, Apple Bloom?"
Apple Bloom,"So I was thinkin'... maybe we could go to Diamond Tiara's cute-cea<f1>era together. I don't have a cutie mark, you don't have a cutie mark."
Twist,"Well, um..."
Twist,"Isn't my cutie mark swell? I've always loved making my own favorite sweets, but it took me some time to discover that it was my super-special talent. Pretty sweet, huh?"
Apple Bloom,"Yeah, pretty... sweet."
Twist,"Hey... this doesn't mean we can't go to the cute-cea<f1>era together. You're still gonna come to the party, are you?"
Diamond Tiara,Of course she will.
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head. Let me do something about that. What's the matter, kid?"
Apple Bloom,[inhales] There's a cute-cea<f1>era this afternoon and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I wanna get my cutie mark but I'm no good at sellin' apples but I really wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark which my big sister says I'm gonna get eventually but... I WANT IT NOW!
Apple Bloom,Applejack says these things take time. I have to just wait for it to happen.
Rainbow Dash,Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?
Apple Bloom,But Applejack says th...
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark? I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry. It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAM, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning."
Rainbow Dash,"That's right, stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose. The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark. Are you ready?"
Apple Bloom,I'm ready!
Rainbow Dash,I said: Are! You! Ready!
Apple Bloom,I'M READY!
Apple Bloom,Ah!
Apple Bloom,Whoa!
Apple Bloom,Hi-ya! Ee...
Apple Bloom,Whoaaa! Whoa...
Rainbow Dash,Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...
Silver Spoon,"Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party."
Diamond Tiara,I know. It totally shows off my cutie mark.
Silver Spoon,I love being special.
Diamond Tiara,Can you imagine how embarrassing it must be to be... not special?
Silver Spoon,"I don't even want to, like, think about it."
Rainbow Dash,Tried that one... tried that one...
Apple Bloom,I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find sumth'n I'm good at.
Pinkie Pie,You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.
Apple Bloom,Eatin' cupcakes?
Rainbow Dash,Eating cupcakes?
Pinkie Pie,Eating cupcaaakes!
Apple Bloom,"I really appreciate all your help, Rainbow Dash. You're a really great coach and I really learned a lot from you and I'm sure I can learn a lot more but... I've got some cupcakes to eat! See you at the cute-cea<f1>era! Hold on, Pinkie Pie, I'm comin'."
Apple Bloom,"I can't believe I didn't think of this. A cupcake-eating cutie mark, it's sooo obvious. Now, where are those cupcakes? I'm ready t' chow down!"
Pinkie Pie,I don't have any cupcakes.
Apple Bloom,Oh.
Pinkie Pie,[gasp] But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some.
Apple Bloom,"I guess, uh, making-cupcakes cutie mark could work too."
Pinkie Pie,"All you have to do is take a cup of flour! Add it to the mix! Now just take a little something sweet, not sour! A bit of salt, just a pinch!"
Others,"Baking these treats is such a cinch! Add a teaspoon of vanilla! Add a little more, and you count to four, And you never get your fill of..."
Others,"Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty! Cupcakes! Don't be too hasty! Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES!"
Apple Bloom,"[cough] Hot, hot, hot!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oooh, those look much better than the last batch. [chomp] Mmm..."
Apple Bloom,"Ugh! I guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either. [sigh] I just have to face it, I'm gonna have a blank flank forever."
Pinkie Pie,What about that?
Apple Bloom,"What about what? Is there something on my flank? Is there, is there, is there? [gasp] A cutie mark! It's a... a measuring cup? No. A mixin' bowl? No... Are those cupcakes? A tower of cupcakes maybe."
Pinkie Pie,"[blow] Flour. It's flour! Yay! I guessed it. What game you wanna play next? Please say bingo, please say bingo."
Twilight Sparkle,"Whoa, what's been going on in here?"
Pinkie Pie,"We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Nnnno thank you... not that they don't look, heh, delicious."
Apple Bloom,"Twilight, you have to help me!"
Twilight Sparkle,What's the matter?
Apple Bloom,"[inhales] Tiara's cute-cea<f1>era's today and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I want to get my cutie mark but I'm no good at selling apples or hang-gliding or making cupcakes, but I wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark, which Pinkie Pie says I can't just make appear, but I need it to appear, right now!"
Twilight Sparkle,Uhhh... I don't follow. How can I help you?
Apple Bloom,You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh no, Apple Bloom. A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself."
Apple Bloom,"Please Twilight, jus' trah."
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, but-"
Apple Bloom,"Oh please, please, please please please!"
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, all right!"
Apple Bloom,Oh thank you thank you thank you. [pwing] Yes! I knew you could do... it.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, sweetie, but I told you-"
Apple Bloom,"Try again, try again!"
Twilight Sparkle,Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time.
Apple Bloom,"It's hopeless, hopeless! I just won't go to the party, I can't go. Everyone will just laugh at me and make fun of me and call me names. It will be the worst night of my life."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.
Apple Bloom,"Forget it, there's no way I'm going to that [gulp] party."
Apple Bloom,How could I have forgotten the time? How could I have forgotten Pinkie Pie was hosting the party? How could I have forgotten it was at Sugarcube Corner?
Pinkie Pie,"Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!"
Apple Bloom,I have to get out of here before anypony sees me.
Diamond Tiara,"Hey! It's my cute-cea<f1>era, I'm supposed to get the first bite at cake."
Apple Bloom,"Okay, Apple Bloom, almost there."
Applejack,"Apple Bloom, you made it. After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up. I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. These things happen when these things are supposed to happen. Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you."
Diamond Tiara,"Well well well, look who's here."
Silver Spoon,Nice outfit.
Apple Bloom,"Just sumt'n I, uh, pulled together last minute."
Diamond Tiara,"It really shows off your cutie mark. Oh wait, that's right, you don't have one."
Apple Bloom,"Uh, I have a cutie mark."
Silver Spoon,"Eh, what? Since when?"
Apple Bloom,Since... Um... Earlier today.
Diamond Tiara,Oh really? Let's see it.
Apple Bloom,"I shouldn't. I couldn't. My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing, I'm afraid that if I show it off, everyone will start paying attention to me instead of you. Outshined at your own cute-cea<f1>era. Can you imagine how embarrassing that would be?"
Diamond Tiara,"Uh, forget it, I didn't really want to see it anyway."
Apple Bloom,Oh no.
Silver Spoon,"Wow, that is an amazing cutie mark."
Diamond Tiara,Nice try...
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon,Blank flank!
Scootaloo,[offscreen] You got a problem with blank flanks?
Scootaloo,"I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?"
Silver Spoon,"The problem is, I mean, she's like, totally not special."
Sweetie Belle,"No, it means she's full of potential."
Scootaloo,"It means she could be great at anything. The possibilities are, [mocking] like, endless."
Sweetie Belle,"She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer. She could even be mayor of Ponyville someday."
Scootaloo,And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two.
Diamond Tiara,"Hey, this is my party, why are you two on her side?"
Scootaloo,Because...
Apple Bloom,[gasp] You don't have your cutie marks either? I thought I was the only one.
Scootaloo,We thought we were the only two.
Twilight Sparkle,I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.
Diamond Tiara,Lucky? How can they be lucky?
Twilight Sparkle,"They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be."
Applejack,"And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon."
Others,"""Tornado Bolt"": Wow, Apple Bloom, I wish I could be a scientist."
Others,"""Pi<f1>a Colada"": Do you really think you could be mayor?"
Others,"""Coronet"": Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon."
Diamond Tiara,"Hey, what's everypony doing? This is my party, everypony is supposed to be paying attention to me."
Silver Spoon,"Whatever. We still think you're losers, right, Diamond Tiara? Bump, bump, sugar... lump..."
Diamond Tiara,"Not now, Silver Spoon."
Scootaloo,Name's Scootaloo.
Sweetie Belle,And I'm Sweetie Belle.
Apple Bloom,Apple Bloom.
Twist,This song is so super!
Apple Bloom,"So I was thinking, now that we're friends... I mean, we are friends, right?"
Scootaloo,"How could we not be? We're totally alike. We don't have cutie marks, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon drive us crazy--"
Sweetie Belle,Totally crazy.
Apple Bloom,"Well, now that we're friends, what if the three of us work together to find out who we are and what we're supposed to be?"
Sweetie Belle,Ooh! Ooh! We could form our own secret society.
Scootaloo,I'm liking this idea.
Apple Bloom,A secret society. Yeah. We need a name for it though.
Scootaloo,The Cutie Mark Three?
Sweetie Belle,The Cutastically Fantastics?
Apple Bloom,How about... The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
Scootaloo,It's perfect!
Sweetie Belle,This is gonna be so great!
Apple Bloom,We're gonna be unstoppable!
Scootaloo,What do you say we celebrate with some of these delicious cupcakes?
Apple Bloom,Not the cupcakes. Trust me.
Sweetie Belle,Let's see if there are any cookies.
Apple Bloom,Yeah! Come on.
Twilight Sparkle,"Dearest Princess Celestia,"
Others,"I am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out..."
Princess Celestia,...can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are. Hmm...
Rainbow Dash,[grunt] Whoo-hoo!
Applejack,Hoo-wee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?"
Applejack,"I know I can. [grunt] Oh, for Pete's sake!"
Rainbow Dash,Heh! Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse. The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.
Applejack,"All right, all right. You got another throw there, pony girl."
Applejack,"[sarcastically] Wow, Rainbow, heh. You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it."
Applejack,[grunt] Yee-haw! It's a ringer. That's how you do it down here on the farm.
Rainbow Dash,I lost.
Applejack,"Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow. It's all in good fun."
Rainbow Dash,I hate losing.
Applejack,"Besides, you're a mighty good athlete. I'm just better. Heh heh heh."
Rainbow Dash,"All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?"
Applejack,"Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gildin' the lily."
Rainbow Dash,...and I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it.
Applejack,Prove what?
Rainbow Dash,"I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition. A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all."
Applejack,"You know what, Rainbow? You're on."
Twilight Sparkle,"So you two are doing what, now?"
Applejack,An Iron<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,Iron Pony competition.
Applejack,"See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,And I'm here to...?
Rainbow Dash,[grunt] I don't know. Why is she here?
Applejack,To be our judge and keep score.
Spike,"Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, Spike, who are you talking to?"
Spike,"Um... Uh, them! Let the games begin!"
Twilight Sparkle,Ready. Set. Go!
Applejack,[gasp] Dagnabbit.
Twilight Sparkle,"Time, Spike?"
Spike,17 seconds.
Applejack,You're kiddin'! That breaks my record from last year's rodeo.
Spike,But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel.
Applejack,"[sigh] Nuts and chews! Still, that's 22 seconds. Not too shabby. Hey, don't be nervous. Remember, it's all in good fun. Now git on up there."
Twilight Sparkle,Ready. Set. Go!
Applejack,"Woo! That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!"
Rainbow Dash,"Thanks, but I [pant] couldn't have been as fast as you."
Applejack,"What was the time on that, Spike?"
Spike,18 seconds!
Applejack,"18 seconds. Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?"
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, I can't believe I won."
Applejack,"Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it."
Applejack,Years of applebuckin'.
Rainbow Dash,Ugh.
Granny Smith,Waa-hoo!
Apple Bloom,Whoo-hoo!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Spike,Why me?
Twilight Sparkle,Go!
Spike,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-hoa! Whoa! Whoaaa! Ouch.
Rainbow Dash,Ready for another pony ride?
Spike,No.
Twilight Sparkle,Go!
Spike,Guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guhwhoaaaaaa!
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash wins the bronco-buck.
Spike,And I lose.
Spike,Whoa! [grunt] How do I get roped into these things?
Rainbow Dash,[grunt] Does this count?
Applejack,[grunt] Wah!
Rainbow Dash,Yeah.
Spike,"Fillies and gentlecolts, at the halfway point, our competitors are tied at five and five."
Twilight Sparkle,Who are you talking to?
Spike,Them!
Twilight Sparkle,"95, 96, 97, 98, 99... a hundred!"
Rainbow Dash,Yes!
Applejack,"Be a good sport, Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, you two. This is the final event. Give it all you've got."
Spike,Looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one.
Applejack,[mumbling] That's not fair. You can't use your wings to help you win.
Rainbow Dash,Huh?
Applejack,[mumbling] You're cheatin'!
Rainbow Dash,I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.
Rainbow Dash,Whoo-hoo! I win by a landslide... or mudslide in your case. [chuckles] I am the Iron Pony!
Applejack,Only 'cause you cheated.
Rainbow Dash,What?
Applejack,You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests.
Rainbow Dash,Sounds like sour apples to me.
Applejack,Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?
Rainbow Dash,Well... no. But you never said I couldn't use my wings.
Applejack,I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.
Rainbow Dash,I still would have won even without my wings.
Applejack,Hah! Prove it.
Rainbow Dash,Gladly. How?
Applejack,Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves. I challenge you to race me in it.
Rainbow Dash,Heh! Easy shmeasy.
Applejack,"Hold on! There is one condition: the point is to run, so no wings allowed."
Rainbow Dash,No wings? No problem.
Spike,"Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race."
Twilight Sparkle,Why are you so excited about the race? It's only for ponies.
Spike,"Yeah, but I'm hoping I can be the announcer again. Just listen: Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the annual Running of the--"
Pinkie Pie,"Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves! This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer."
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken."
Pinkie Pie,"As everypony knows, the Running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall. So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes."
Rainbow Dash,"Pardon me, excuse me. Make way for the Iron Pony."
Applejack,"The Iron Phony, you mean."
Rainbow Dash,"So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?"
Applejack,"I'm ready to run a good, clean race."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, yeah..."
Applejack,You are not allowed to use your wings.
Rainbow Dash,I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back.
Applejack,"[grunts] Trussed up like a turkey. Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is."
Rainbow Dash,Very funny.
Applejack,'Least now we know we're racin' fair and square.
Pinkie Pie,Racers! Please take your positions!
Spike,Um... Pinkie Pie?
Spike,"Uh, yeah. I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and... I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but... I was just wondering..."
Pinkie Pie,What?
Spike,Aw... Forget it.
Pinkie Pie,Spike! Would you like to be my co-reporter? We could comment on the action together.
Spike,We could?
Pinkie Pie,Climb on up.
Applejack,Twilight? What in tarnation are you doin' up here?
Twilight Sparkle,I'm racing.
Rainbow Dash,"[laughs] Good one, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm not joking.
Rainbow Dash,"What? You're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead."
Twilight Sparkle,"I am not an egghead, I am well-read."
Rainbow Dash,[softly] Egghead.
Applejack,[snickers] But have you ever run a race?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, no, but I do know a lot about running."
Rainbow Dash,And you know this from...
Twilight Sparkle,Books. I've read several on the subject.
Rainbow Dash,"What'd you read, ""The Egghead's Guide to Running""? Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up? [laugh] Get it? Eye muscles."
Twilight Sparkle,"Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the Running of the Leaves is a Ponyville tradition, and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself."
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. See you at the finish line... Tomorrow.
Pinkie Pie,"All right, ponies, are you ready?"
Spike,Get set.
Pinkie Pie,And they're off!
Pinkie Pie,"Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves! You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. No, that's left to my little ponies."
Spike,"Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall."
Pinkie Pie,"Ugh. Those lazy, lazy leaves. But this year, the run is about more than the weather. It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it: Applejack and Rainbow Dash."
Spike,"You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle. Trying to prove who's the most athletic."
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, and ""grudge"" rhymes with ""fudge""."
Spike,"Yes, it... does. What?"
Pinkie Pie,And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
Spike,So... no fudge?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck and neck. But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. But Rainbow Dash won't let Applejack have it and takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose. Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... roughly speaking. Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!"
Applejack,"Not so easy without wings, is it?"
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash."
Spike,"Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash is catching up the frontrunner Applejack!"
Pinkie Pie,What an upset. I thought Applejack had this in the bag.
Rainbow Dash,"You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?"
Applejack,Whoa! I don't believe it.
Twilight Sparkle,"I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?"
Applejack,"Not the scenery, Twilight. Rainbow Dash just tripped me."
Twilight Sparkle,She did not.
Applejack,She did too!
Twilight Sparkle,"She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock."
Applejack,"What? Oh, hayseed! Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow."
Twilight Sparkle,Just be careful!
Applejack,See you at the finish line!
Spike,"I don't believe it. After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack."
Pinkie Pie,"She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The cat's pajamas! Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her."
Spike,Oookay... Let's get back to the race.
Rainbow Dash,"Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet!"
Applejack,It is for you. Heh.
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa! Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me."
Twilight Sparkle,Don't you ponies ever look where you're going? You tripped on a stump. See?
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat. It was just an accident."
Rainbow Dash,"Sure it was. I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was."
Twilight Sparkle,"Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game."
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game."
Pinkie Pie,"Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie."
Spike,And Spike. Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up.
Pinkie Pie,"I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally, I prefer mustard. How about you, Spike?"
Spike,Uh... I... like... pickles?
Pinkie Pie,Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.
Rainbow Dash,"Look, ma, no wings."
Spike,"As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead."
Applejack,"Ugh. Hey, Rainbow!"
Applejack,"[gasp] Why, that little cheater did that on purpose. It's on."
Rainbow Dash,"Nice one, Rainbow."
Applejack,Later!
Rainbow Dash,[gasp] Aaa!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely. Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?"
Rainbow Dash,[chuckling] I'm sure I'll win now.
Twilight Sparkle,Except that the other racers just passed you.
Rainbow Dash,Oh horse apples... See ya!
Pinkie Pie,"Applejack, what are you doing up here?"
Spike,There aren't even any trees.
Applejack,"Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way... Rainbow. Mind giving me a lift?"
Rainbow Dash,What the hay?! You said no flying!
Applejack,"No, I said no wings."
Pinkie Pie,"I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!"
Spike,With the most interesting announcing.
Pinkie Pie,But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the lack of running!
Rainbow Dash,[grunt] Aaa!
Applejack,Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,"Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running?"
Rainbow Dash,"You know, I think Twilight's right."
Applejack,You do?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better... RUUUN!"
Pinkie Pie,"Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck and neck, jockeying for position. Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack--"
Spike,"Oh no, she di'int!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh yes, she di'id!"
Applejack,Cut it out!
Rainbow Dash,"No, you cut it out!"
Applejack,You started it.
Rainbow Dash,And now I'm gonna finish it.
Applejack,"Oh no, you won't."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh yes, I will. [grunt] That's it! All bets are off!"
Applejack,"Oh no, you don't."
Pinkie Pie,"It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash--"
Rainbow Dash,I won!
Applejack,"No, I won!"
Rainbow Dash,I won!
Spike,You tied!
Applejack and Rainbow Dash,Tied?!
Applejack,For first?
Pinkie Pie,For last!
Applejack,Last?!
Rainbow Dash,Then who won?
Applejack and Rainbow Dash,You?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering I've never run a race before."
Applejack,What? How's that even possible?
Rainbow Dash,"You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery."
Twilight Sparkle,"Exactly. I paced myself, just like my book said. Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish."
Rainbow Dash,I don't believe it. Twilight beat us.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy."
Applejack,"You're right, Twilight. Our behavior was just terrible."
Rainbow Dash,We weren't very good sports.
Princess Celestia,Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned.
Applejack and Rainbow Dash,Princess Celestia?!
Applejack,W-What are you doin' here?
Princess Celestia,"Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves."
Applejack,"I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sports, Princess."
Princess Celestia,"That's all right, Applejack. Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition."
Twilight Sparkle,It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition.
Princess Celestia,"Exactly, Twilight. Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered."
Applejack,"Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. Whaddya say, friend? Wanna go for another run?"
Rainbow Dash,I'd love to stretch my legs.
Rarity,"Oh, Opalescence. Can't you just picture it? Moi, stepping out in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!"
Rarity,"Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking."
Rarity,"Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you. What's that? You want to help me more? Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing? Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all."
Applejack,"Howdy, Rarity!"
Twilight Sparkle,Shh... Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
Applejack,What do you think she's makin'?
Twilight Sparkle,Looks like a dress.
Applejack,"Well, that makes sense. Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all."
Rarity,Is there something I can help you with?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor. Could you please fix the button for me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala."
Rarity,"Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. This dress is fine."
Rarity,Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.
Twilight Sparkle,But...
Rarity,Not another word! I won't take no for an answer.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, in that case... Thank you for your generosity, Rarity. Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful."
Rarity,"Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either."
Applejack,Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
Rarity,"You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire."
Applejack,Hm... Nah.
Rarity,What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
Applejack,"Okay, sure. Why not? Since you're up for it and all. Just don't make them too... frou-frou-y."
Rarity,Deal!
Rainbow Dash,Look out below!
Rainbow Dash,Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.
Rarity,"Hmm... [gasp] Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,Outfit for the what now?
Rarity,"I'll make one for you and you and all of you. Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!"
Twilight Sparkle,What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it.
Rarity,"Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. Plus, fun!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, I love fun things!"
Rarity,Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us.
Applejack,"So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies? And lickety split?"
Rarity,"Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard."
Rarity,"Thread by thread, stitching it together Twilight's dress, cutting out the pattern snip by snip Making sure the fabric folds nicely It's the perfect color and so hip Always gotta keep in mind my pacing Making sure the clothes' correctly facing I'm stitching Twilight's dress"
Others,"Yard by yard, fussing on the details Jewel neckline, don't you know a stitch in time saves nine? Make her something perfect to inspire Even though she hates formal attire Gotta mind those intimate details Even though she's more concerned with sales It's Applejack's new dress"
Others,"Dressmaking's easy, for Pinkie Pie something pink Fluttershy something breezy Blend color and form, [To Opalescence] Do you think it looks cheesy?"
Others,"Something brash, perhaps quite fetching Hook and eye, couldn't you just simply die? Making sure it fits forelock and crest Don't forget some magic in the dress Even though it rides high on the flank Rainbow won't look like a tank I'm stitching Rainbow's dress"
Others,"Piece by piece, snip by snip Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip Thread by thread, primmed and pressed Yard by yard, never stressed And that's the art of the dress!"
Rarity,"That's it. Keep them closed. Don't look. Okay, you can look now!"
Rarity,"These are your new outfits. What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not? And Twilight! I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality. Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. Oh, and it turned out beautiful, don't you think? And I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring! And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing?"
Twilight Sparkle,Wow... They're...
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, they're..."
Applejack,They sure are... somethin'.
Twilight Sparkle,Yes! Something.
Pinkie Pie,I love something! Something is my favorite!
Fluttershy,It's... nice.
Rarity,But what's the matter? Don't you like them?
Twilight Sparkle,They're very nice...
Applejack,And we're plumb grateful 'cause you worked so hard on them.
Rainbow Dash,Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining. She asked.
Twilight Sparkle,I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
Rarity,"That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more where that came from. They were only a first pass. You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied. Not to worry, I'll redo them."
Fluttershy,"Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that. They're fine."
Rarity,I want them to be better than just fine. I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Applejack,"Are you sure? I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose."
Rarity,"Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity."
Rarity,What have I gotten myself into?
Fluttershy,"Hello? You wanted to see me, Rarity?"
Rarity,Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it. What do you think?
Fluttershy,I... love it.
Rarity,"Oh, you're just saying that."
Fluttershy,"No, no. I do. It's... nice."
Rarity,"""Nice""?"
Fluttershy,Nice.
Rarity,"If you don't like it, you should just tell me."
Fluttershy,"Oh, but I do like it."
Rarity,Like it or love it?
Fluttershy,Um... both?
Rarity,Which is it?
Fluttershy,"Please stop asking me this, I..."
Rarity,"Well, just tell me what you really think."
Fluttershy,"No, that's okay..."
Rarity,Tell me.
Fluttershy,No... it's fine...
Rarity,Tell me!
Fluttershy,I... like it...
Rarity,"Tell me, tell me, tell-me-tell-me-tell-me!"
Fluttershy,"All right! Since you really wanna know... [inhales] The armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch, and the overdesign is reminiscent of pr<ea>t-<e0>-porter and not true French haute couture. [pauses] But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine."
Twilight Sparkle,"Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. Orion has three stars on his belt, not four."
Rarity,"Stitch by stitch, stitching it together Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right? Even if my fabric choice was perfect Gotta get them all done by tonight Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive Wait until you see it in the light I'm sewing them together!"
Pinkie Pie,"Don't you think my gown would be more ""me"" with some lollipops?"
Rarity,"Well, I think..."
Pinkie Pie,Balloons?
Rarity,Well...
Pinkie Pie,Do it!
Rarity,"Hour by hour, one more change I'm sewing them together, take great pains Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind? Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine"
Others,"Dressmaking's easy, every customer's call Brings a whole new revision Have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision"
Twilight Sparkle,"That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor."
Fluttershy,"French haute couture, please."
Rarity,Ugh...
Applejack,What if it rains? Galoshes!
Pinkie Pie,"More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!"
Rarity,Streamers?
Pinkie Pie,Whose dress is this?
Rarity,Streamers it is.
Rainbow Dash,What?
Rarity,Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
Rainbow Dash,"No, I just want my dress to be cool."
Rarity,Do you not like the color?
Rainbow Dash,"The color's fine, just make it look cooler."
Rarity,Do you not like the shape?
Rainbow Dash,"The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about 20% cooler."
Pinkie Pie,All we ever want is indecision
Rainbow Dash,All we really like is what we know
Twilight Sparkle,Gotta balance style with adherence
Fluttershy,Making sure we make a good appearance
Applejack,Even if you simply have to fudge it
All sans Rarity,Make sure that it stays within our budget
Rarity,"Got to overcome intimidation Remember, it's all in the presentation!"
Others,"Piece by piece, snip by snip Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed Yard by yard, always stressed And that's the art of the dress!"
Rarity,"Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made."
Rarity,Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for. Now don't hold back. Let me know what you really think.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh my!
Fluttershy,It's... perfect!
Rainbow Dash,It's cool!
Applejack,"Why, they're the best duds I ever did see."
All sans Rarity,It's exactly what I asked for!
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you, Rarity."
Pinkie Pie,Are you as happy with them as we are? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Rarity,"Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy. I'm just relieved to finally be done."
Spike,You are never gonna believe this! You've heard of Hoity Toity?
Twilight Sparkle,The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Spike,"Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show. Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him... He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!"
Applejack,"Whoa, Nelly! You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy. Your business will be boomin'!"
Twilight Sparkle,Wow!
Rainbow Dash,That's so cool!
Pinkie Pie,I don't believe it!
Rarity,Hoity Toity? He's coming here? To see THESE dresses?
Spike,Yep! Get ready for all of your dreams to come true.
Rarity,"Oh. [gasp] There he is! [deep breaths] Okay. Relax, Rarity. Your friends like their outfits and so will he. [squeals] What's wrong with the lights?! Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good."
Spike,"Since the beginning of time, the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions that truly expressed the essence of their very souls. Patiently waiting decades -- no, centuries -- for the perfect pony gown. Today, at long last, Equestria, your wait is over! Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity!"
Applejack,Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
Twilight Sparkle,Oh dear.
Rainbow Dash,You think we overdid it?
Applejack,"Nah. [pause] Okay, maybe a little."
Hoity Toity,"Oh, those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink! It's a travesty is what it is. Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame. Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors? Not to mention wasting my valuable time."
Others,Rarity [to Opal]: Oh! Hide me.
Spike,"Come on out and take a bow, Rarity. You worked really hard for this. Yes! All right, woo-hoo! Go, Rarity!"
Pinkie Pie,Rarity? You okay in there? You haven't come out for days.
Twilight Sparkle,"You're not a laughing stock, Rarity..."
Rainbow Dash,She kind of is.
Twilight Sparkle,Shhh! Come on out and talk to us.
Rarity,"[sobbing] Leave me alone! I vant to be alone! I want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in! I'm so pathetic!"
Twilight Sparkle,Now what do we do?
Fluttershy,Uh... panic?
Rainbow Dash,That's your answer for everything!
Applejack,"Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this."
Pinkie Pie,She'll become a crazy cat lady!
Twilight Sparkle,She only has one cat.
Pinkie Pie,Give her time.
Rarity,"Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing. What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm?"
Rarity,Huh? Opal?
Rarity,"Opal, how did you get up there? Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!"
Rarity,Rainbow Dash?! How dare you strand my poor Opal in a tree?
Rainbow Dash,"Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this?"
Pinkie Pie,We all finished your dress for you.
Applejack,Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Fluttershy,Do you like it?
Rarity,Like it? Like it?!
Fluttershy,Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.
Rarity,"No, I don't like it."
All except Rarity,Awwww...
Rarity,I love it!
All except Rarity,Yay!
Rarity,You ponies did an amazing job. It's exactly the way I imagined it.
Fluttershy,We just followed your brilliant design.
Twilight Sparkle,Like we should have let you do for our outfits. Those first dresses you designed were perfect.
Pinkie Pie,We're so super sorry.
Rainbow Dash,You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them. We all saw how well that turned out.
Rarity,"Oh, I forgive you."
Applejack,"Well, that's mighty big of you."
Rarity,But my whole career is still ruined!
Applejack,"Oh, right. That."
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe not.
Hoity Toity,"All right, I haven't got all day."
Hoity Toity,Take two.
Hoity Toity,"Hello... Oh, this can't be the same designer."
Hoity Toity,"Simply magnificent! And I suddenly have a fierce craving for some Dutch apple pie, candied apples on a stick, apple turnovers, apple cobbler..."
Hoity Toity,Brilliant!
Hoity Toity,"Oh, spectacular!"
Hoity Toity,"Now this is a fashion show! All of these dresses are absolutely amazing. Who is responsible? Step forward, show yourself!"
Hoity Toity,Brava! Brava! Magnifico! Encore!
Rarity,"Oh, thank you. Thank you! Oh, thank you so much!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Hoity Toity,"Rarity, my congratulations to you on a most impressive fashion debut. Would you do me the great honor of allowing me to feature your couture in my Best of the Best Boutique in Canterlot?"
Hoity Toity,"Now, I'll need you to make a dozen of each dress for me by next Tuesday."
Twilight Sparkle,Tuh! Nuh! Uh! Nyuh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Eyes over here, Spike!"
Spike,"Uh, sorry."
Twilight Sparkle,"For this to work, it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the-"
Pinkie Pie,Ooh!
Spike,Nyuh!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! This magic needs our full attention to make it happen. There's no other way!
Spike,I can't help it. Look!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie."
Spike,Super-extra Pinkie Pie today.
Pinkie Pie,Hmm... Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch.
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie? What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you up to?"
Pinkie Pie,Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail! It's a-twitch a-twitchin'! And you know what that means!
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea."
Pinkie Pie,The twitchin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling! You two better duck for cover.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain. Why, there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh!"
Pinkie Pie,"He just said ""nice catch"" in Frog."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm so, so sorry. You okay, Twilight Sparkle? I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bogg."
Twilight Sparkle,Of course you did.
Fluttershy,[muffled] Bye-bye!
Pinkie Pie,Um... Twilight? You gotta little somethin' on your face there.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense tell you that, too?"
Pinkie Pie,Nah! I could just see it. La-la-la-la-la...
Twilight Sparkle,"C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion."
Spike,"Wow! That was amazing! Pinkie Pie predicted something would fall, and it did!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, come on. She said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time. A coincidence, nothing else to it."
Pinkie Pie,My tail! My tail! Twitch-a-twitch! Twitch-a-twitch! Somethin' else is gonna fall!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Pinkie, please. Nothing else is gonna fa-aaah!"
Spike,"Oh no, Twilight fell! Is it... safe to go help her?"
Pinkie Pie,"It's okay, my tail stopped twitching. La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la..."
Spike,Ha ha! That was amazing!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, please."
Applejack,"Uh, Twilight? Why are you hanging out in a ditch?"
Spike,"Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future."
Applejack,[gasp] Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense? Whoa! Nyu-uh!
Spike,"Don't worry, it's safe. Prediction already came true."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?"
Applejack,"I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while, have learned over time that, if Pinkie's a-twichin', you better listen."
Pinkie Pie,My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!
Spike,Nyuh! What does that mean?!
Pinkie Pie,I'll start a bath for you.
Twilight Sparkle,Huh? [chuckles] A bath? This thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute!
Twilight Sparkle,Phhhhft.
Pinkie Pie,"Sooo, basically, it works like this: I get different, little, niggly feelings and they mean different things. Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen."
Twilight Sparkle,Is your knee pinchy now?
Pinkie Pie,"No, but my shoulder's achy. That means there's an alligator in the tub."
Twilight Sparkle,"[scream] How come your knee didn't get pinchy?! That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!"
Pinkie Pie,"No, it's not, silly! This is my pet alligator, Gummy. He's got no teeth. See? Haha!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, okay... I get it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I still don't believe all this... ""special power"" stuff. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo."
Pinkie Pie,"What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Huge! For one thing, [clears throat] magic is something you study and practice. It only happens when you decide to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen. With you, uh, it makes no sense at all!"
Pinkie Pie,"That's so not true, Twilight! Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em ""combos""."
Twilight Sparkle,Combos?
Pinkie Pie,"Sure! You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, sure."
Pinkie Pie,"Uh-oh, I feel a combo coming on. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!"
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ughhh... You said that combo meant ""beautiful rainbow""."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh no-no-no-no-no. You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch. That usually means ""look out for opening doors"". You okay?"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't believe this.
Pinkie Pie,You don't believe because you don't understand.
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm...
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay. Now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information."
Pinkie Pie,Okie-dokie-lokie!
Twilight Sparkle,Any twitches yet?
Pinkie Pie,Nopey-dopey!
Twilight Sparkle,Now? Anything?
Pinkie Pie,"Wait! Hold on! Uhh, no."
Twilight Sparkle,"Are you kidding me?! After a whole day of nonstop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?"
Pinkie Pie,"I don't control it, they just come and go."
Twilight Sparkle,That makes no sense!
Pinkie Pie,"Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out."
Twilight Sparkle,I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.
Pinkie Pie,"Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh my gosh, what? What is it?!"
Pinkie Pie,It's my tummy! That usually means I'm hungry! Let's eat!
Twilight Sparkle,Urgh... You know what? [bite] [snap] Just forget it! I don't need to know if this is real or not. I don't need to understand it! I don't even care!
Pinkie Pie,Okie-dokie-lokie. [gasp] Uh-oh. [gasp] Hu-bu-bu-bu-buh!
Spike,Pinkie? Have you seen Twilight?
Pinkie Pie,Uh-huh.
Spike,Twilight? What are ya doing back there?
Twilight Sparkle,Rrrrgh... Did you two plan this?
Spike,Plan what?
Twilight Sparkle,Urgh! This is ridiculous. This can't be happening. This makes no sense. I have to figure this out.
Spike,Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,Ah!
Spike,Whoa-oh-uh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Honestly, Spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies?"
Spike,"Oh, sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasp] No! I'm doing scientific research. I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name: Pinkius Pieicus, in its natural habitat."
Spike,Pinkius-whoicus? Hh!
Twilight Sparkle,"There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it. So, shh. Come on, Pinkius Pieicus is on the move."
Twilight Sparkle,Hm... Itchy nose...
Twilight Sparkle,"Aha! That makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky, but a twitchy tail means something's gonna fall from the sky, not an itchy nose."
Twilight Sparkle,This proves...
Twilight Sparkle,"...perhaps conclusively, that<U+0097>"
Spike,Gah!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Where are you going? I'm trying to teach you the value of scientific<U+0097>
Spike,What's she doing now?
Twilight Sparkle,Smelling a flower.
Spike,Holy guacamole! I wonder what that means?
Twilight Sparkle,"Probably that the flower smells good. Wait. I'm getting something. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch."
Spike,"Hold on... You told me that's the combo that says ""watch out for opening doors""!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh-ho. You really, really believe this stuff, don't you? Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of. You see? I promise you there's nothing to fear from that<U+0097> Wo-o-ah! Ow! Ugh! Ow! Ow!"
Applejack,"Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?"
Spike,"Here, let me help you."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, take this down: twitchy tail."
Spike,Twitchy tail? [gasp] Twitchy tail!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?"
Spike,"Something's gonna fall, something's gonna fall! Run for your lives. Ah-ha-ha!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, Spike honestly, you're overreact<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh!
Pinkie Pie,"[humming] Hey, Applejack. Whatcha doin'?"
Applejack,"Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day without me knowing."
Twilight Sparkle,You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me?
Pinkie Pie,"[giggles] Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!"
Twilight Sparkle,Urgh!
Spike,Tail... still twitching?
Pinkie Pie,"All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell<U+0097> Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!"
Spike,Oh no! What does that one mean?
Pinkie Pie,"Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy. Something you'd never expect to happen is gonna happen! Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu! And it's gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bogg!"
Applejack,[gasp] That's where Fluttershy's headed!
Spike,Oh no! Is it about her?
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, I'm not sure."
Applejack,We better go and make sure she's okay.
Twilight Sparkle,"Calm down, everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all."
Spike,Guh<U+0097> Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.
Pinkie Pie,Okie-dokie!
Pinkie Pie,[shivers] Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
Twilight Sparkle,Cold? Need a jacket or something?
Pinkie Pie,"No thanks, I'm fine. [shivers] Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!"
Spike,So... Whadda'ya think happened to Fluttershy?
Applejack,I hope nothin'.
Spike,"I know, but, whadda'ya think happened?"
Applejack,I'm tryin' not to think about it.
Spike,"Me too. But I'm thinkin' about it anyway. Like, what if she exploded?"
Applejack,Just exploded? For no reason?
Spike,"Yeah, like boom!"
Pinkie Pie,Whoa!
Spike,I know.
Pinkie Pie,"What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!?"
Spike,Can you do that? Can you explode twice?
Applejack,Of course not.
Spike,"But what if she exploded, and exploded again, and then<U+0097> ugh!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Will you two stop? She's fine, I'm sure of it."
Applejack,"I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake. Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bogg!"
Applejack,Fluttershy?
Spike,Fluttershy! You're okay!
Fluttershy,Of course.
Applejack,"Phew, what a relief."
Pinkie Pie,I'm so glad everything's all right.
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, I know it's not nice to gloat but... Aha! I told you there was nothing to worry about, and I was right. Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a [cough] doozy, and [cough] and the only [cough] doozy here is how right I am."
Applejack,Um... Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but [cough] ugh, what is that smell? But what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing [cough] in anything you can't see for yourself."
Spike,"W-Well t-then, s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,I see it... But I don't believe it!
Pinkie Pie,Is that a hydra!?
Applejack,Who cares? Run!
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie! Come on!
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Fluttershy,Ah!
Twilight Sparkle,Everypony up that hill!
Spike,He-e-elp!
Twilight Sparkle,"Coming, Spike! Hang on!"
Twilight Sparkle,I think we're gonna make it.
Spike,But Pinkie's still shuddering!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, lookie there, it stopped. O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n."
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, he'll be up here in no time! Quick, one at a time, cross!"
Spike,"Nyu-uh! Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?"
Twilight Sparkle,No.
Spike,How about a squirrel?
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Spike,How 'bout<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,No small rodents of any kind!
Spike,That's too bad.
Fluttershy,"A hop, skip, and a... jump!"
Spike,Whoa-ho!
Pinkie Pie,Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
Twilight,"He's too close. I'll distract him. You two go, now!"
Twilight Sparkle,Oh... What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do? Chaaarge!
Pinkie Pie,T-T-T-twilight!
Pinkie Pie,T-T-T-twilight! You have to jump!
Twilight Sparkle,I'll never make it!
Pinkie Pie,You'll be fine!
Twilight Sparkle,I will not!
Pinkie Pie,It's your only ho-o-ope! You have to take a leap of faith!
Twilight Sparkle,Y-ugh! No! Oh no! Noooo! WA-A-A-AH! Ugh! Blegh!
Pinkie Pie,"I knew you could do it, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bogg, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy. I mean that hydra<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie,That wasn't it.
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Spike,What wasn't what?
Applejack,"What are you talking about, Pink?"
Pinkie Pie,The hydra wasn't the doozy.
Pinkie Pie,"I'm still getting the shudders. Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh. You see? There it is again. Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bogg, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened."
Twilight Sparkle,Huh? But I<U+0097> WHAT?! The hydra wasn't the doozy?! How could it not be the doozy?! What could be doozier than that?!
Pinkie Pie,"Dunno, but it just wasn't it."
Twilight Sparkle,Rrrgh... [flames and growls] Ooh... I give up...
Spike,"Give what up, Twi?"
Twilight Sparkle,"The fight. I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean it's not true."
Pinkie Pie,Y-Y-Y-You m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
Twilight Sparkle,"Eeyup, I guess I do."
Pinkie Pie,"Oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh. Ooh! [gasp] That was it. That's the doozy."
Spike,Bbrrbbrrbbrr.
Twilight Sparkle,What? What is?
Pinkie Pie,"You believing. I never expected that to happen. That was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was! La-la-la-la-la..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter."
Spike,"With pleasure, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that<U+0097> Spike, what have I been saying about focus?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike: I know, but I... Well..."
Twilight Sparkle,"What's wrong, Spike? Never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?"
Spike,"Not really, no."
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. What else can I do?
Twilight Sparkle,"I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way."
Pinkie Pie,Honk!
Spike,Honk.
Twilight Sparkle,"Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
Pinkie Pie,There it goes again.
Twilight Sparkle,I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time?
Pinkie Pie,You never know.
Spike,Twitchy tail? Holy guacamole!
Rainbow Dash,"Now, what have we learned?"
Fluttershy,Loss of control.
Rainbow Dash,Good.
Fluttershy,Screaming and hollering.
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, and most importantly?"
Fluttershy,Passion!
Rainbow Dash,"Right! So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one."
Fluttershy,[inhales] Yay.
Rainbow Dash,... Ugh. You're gonna cheer for me like that? Louder.
Fluttershy,Yay.
Rainbow Dash,Louder!
Fluttershy,Yay.
Rainbow Dash,Louder!
Fluttershy,[deep breath] [quietly] Yaaay.
Rainbow Dash,Ugh...
Fluttershy,Too loud?
Fluttershy,Yay.
Rainbow Dash,"[deep breath] And now, phase one of my routine."
Fluttershy,Wooo.
Rainbow Dash,Phase two.
Fluttershy,Way to go.
Twilight Sparkle,"[sigh] Last one. Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books, guys. It was a crazy week of studying."
Fluttershy,"Rainbow Dash, you rock! Woohoo. [gasp] Did my cheering do that?"
Rainbow Dash,Hehe. Sorry about that ladies. That was a truly feeble performance.
Fluttershy,"Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin."
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh. I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours. That feeble cheering!"
Twilight Sparkle,What are you two arguing about?
Fluttershy,Were we arguing? I'm sorry.
Rainbow Dash,[grunt] I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition.
Twilight Sparkle,What's that?
Pinkie Pie,"It's where all the greatest Pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles! Some are fast! [makes car sounds] And some are graceful. Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Applejack,Golly. I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah. I wish you guys could be there. Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational."
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever! Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean come on! It's a sonic rainboom! How not cool could it possibly not be?!"
Twilight Sparkle,What's a sonic rainboom?
Pinkie Pie,You really need to get out more. The sonic rainboom is legendary! When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going sooo fast... Boom! A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!
Applejack,And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!
Rainbow Dash,It was a long time ago... I was just a filly.
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?"
Rainbow Dash,Are... you kidding? I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale! I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow. If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!"
Rainbow Dash,The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts. A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes... It'll be a dream come true!
Fluttershy,Yay.
Rainbow Dash,"I'm gonna go rest up. Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. Hehe. You, on the other hand, better keep practicing. I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance."
Fluttershy,"She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it. I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, guess we better get this cleaned up... again."
Rarity,"Go on, go on."
Twilight Sparkle,Go on what?
Rarity,Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale. Didn't you see how nervous she was?
Applejack,Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'? She was tootin' her own horn louder than the brass section of a marching band!
Rarity,"Oh, puh-lease. I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it. We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now go on!"
Twilight Sparkle,Owaa! Ugh. How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?
Pinkie Pie,A flight spell? One sec. Page twenty-seven.
Applejack,How'd you do that?
Pinkie Pie,It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.
Twilight Sparkle,"Here it is! A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days. Ooh, it looks really difficult... I'm not sure I can do it."
Rarity,You've got to try!
Twilight Sparkle,Okay... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?
Rarity,"I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first."
Twilight Sparkle,I think it worked!
Rainbow Dash,"You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy. Don't be afraid to speak up."
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Well, well, well. What do we have here?"
Hoops,It's our old friend Rainbow Crash!
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Get kicked outta any flight schools lately?"
Rainbow Dash,I didn't get kicked out.
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Face it, Rainbow Crash. Flight school had too many rules, and not enough naptimes for you."
Hoops,"Huh, ask her about the sonic rainboom."
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": That's nothing but an old mare's tale. You don't have the skills to try something like that."
Fluttershy,"Now wait just a minute! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive. Anyhow... She is going to do a sonic rainboom!"
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": No she's not, 'cause there's no such thing!"
Fluttershy,Then show up at the Cloudeseum and see for yourself! ...If you're free.
Hoops,"[within laughter] Yeah, I'll be free."
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Oh, don't worry. We'll be there!"
Hoops,"See you then, Rainbow Crash!"
Fluttershy,Did you see that? I was so assertive!
Rainbow Dash,[sigh] Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.
Fluttershy,"But, Rainbow Dash. Just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies."
Rainbow Dash,Aaaaaah! What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join. Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest! My life is ruined!
Fluttershy,Rare...
Rainbow Dash,Rare?! The sonic rainboom is way more than rare!
Fluttershy,Rarity?
Rainbow Dash,Rarity! Are you... flying?!
Rarity,I most certainly am! Aren't my wings smashing?! Twilight made them for me. I just adore them! Why so shocked? We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!
Rainbow Dash,"""We""? I... I can't believe it!"
Fluttershy,It's incredible!
Rainbow Dash,This is so cool! You guys made it!
Pinkie Pie,Sure did!
Rainbow Dash,Wait! How'd you do that? Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
Pinkie Pie,"Haha. Pretty cool, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds."
Applejack,And we came to cheer you to victory!
Rainbow Dash,"To be honest, I was starting to get just the teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. But I feel a lot better now that you guys are here. Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?"
Others,"Rarity, Applejack, Yes!"
Rainbow Dash,Here it is: the greatest city in the sky!
Group,Oooh! Aaah!
Rarity,[in mirror] Oooh! Aaah!
Rainbow Dash,Uhh... Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale!
Rarity,"Oh, wait for me!"
Steam Roller,Those wings are gorgeous!
Rarity,"Why, thank you!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Be careful with those wings, Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate."
Rarity,"Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention."
Applejack,"Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made."
Rainbow Dash,"Great idea! C'mon, girls. To the weather factory!"
Rainbow Dash,"This is where they make the snowflakes. Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation."
Rarity,"[gasp] Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here."
Rainbow Dash,We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.
Rainbow Dash,And here's where they make the rainbows!
Pinkie Pie,[slurp] [pants] Spicyyyyyy!...
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor."
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": [offscreen] Whoa!"
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Oh, where'd you get those amazing wings? I want a pair!"
Rarity,"Hmm... Yeah, I guess I could see that."
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Oh, hey look, it's Rainbow Crash again!"
Hoops,Heheheyeah! Rainbow... Umm... Eyah... Crash!
Rainbow Dash,Rarity! What're you doing talking to these guys?
Rarity,"Oh, they were just admiring my wings, Rainbow Dash."
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Yeah, you should forget the sonic rainboom and just get yourself some wings like these!"
Rainbow Dash,Oohh...
Fluttershy,"Uhh... C'mon, girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made? Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure!"
Rainbow Dash,"Are you kidding? I can't do the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. I'm doomed!"
Rarity,"What, these old things? Go ahead, everypony. Photos are encouraged."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, we're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? Put your wings away and stop showing off!"
Rarity,"Oh, pfft. How can you ask me to put away perfection?"
Rarity,Waa-haa-haa!
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, are you okay? You don't look so good."
Rainbow Dash,[panting] Of course! Why wouldn't I be okay? Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.
Rainbowshine,Hey! There's an idea! YOU should enter the competition!
Foggy Fleece,Yeah! I could watch you fly all day long!
Rarity,There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. Perhaps I should compete.
Rainbow Dash,WHAT?!
Rainbow Dash,What am I gonna DO?! I'll never win the competition now...
Rarity,I'm going to be a while!
Madden,Fillies and gentlecolts! Please rise and join me in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia!
Madden,Please welcome our celebrity judges for the Best Young Flyer Competition: the Wonderbolts!
Madden,"And now, let's find out who will take the prize as this year's best young flyer!"
Lucy Packard,"Okay, contestant number one, you're up."
Rainbow Dash,Eyah!
Lucy Packard,"Okay, number two, let's go."
Rainbow Dash,Umm...
Lucy Packard,"C'mon, c'mon, we ain't got all day!"
Rainbow Dash,She's talking to you!
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Oh. Umm... Oh, I guess that's me!"
Lucy Packard,"Okay, number four, time to go."
Rarity,"I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?"
Lucy Packard,"Look, I don't care who it is, but somepony's gotta go on!"
Meadow Song,Let's do this!
Rainbow Dash,Uhh... What am I gonna do?
Twilight Sparkle,I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel rolls in a row can't be easy.
Fluttershy,My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.
Applejack,Hmm... Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet. The competition's almost over.
Lucy Packard,"Number fifteen, let's go!"
Rarity,Rarity... is ready!
Lucy Packard,"Look, ladies. I don't know what to tell you. There's only time for one more performance. If you both want to compete, you'll just have to go out there together!"
Rarity,"Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we?"
Madden,"And now, for our final competitor of the day, contestant number fifteen! Uhh... And apparently contestant number four..."
Rarity,"Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music. That ""rock and roll"" doesn't really match my wings."
Rainbow Dash,"[gulp] C'mon, Rainbow Dash. You can do this. Just remember the routine. Phase one."
Rainbow Dash,Oof. Waaah!
Hoops,"Nice work, Rainbow Crash!"
Rainbow Dash,Time for phase two.
Fluttershy,Look! Phase two is working.
Rarity,And now for my grand finale. I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale! [gasp and squeal] They'll be talking about it for years!
Rainbow Dash,"Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around. Phase three. The sonic [gulp] rainboom. Wings, don't fail me now!"
Rarity,"[panting] Look upon me, Equestria, for I... am... Rarity!"
Twilight Sparkle,Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!
Misty Fly,Ooh!
Soarin,Aah!
Spitfire,Uuh!
Rainbow Dash,"Hold on, Rarity! I'm coming!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, I can't look!"
Fluttershy,A sonic rainboom! She did it! She did it! Wooo!
Rainbow Dash,Whoa.
Fluttershy,A sonic rainboom! Wooo! Yeah!
Rainbow Dash,I did it. I did it!
Rarity,"[sigh] You sure did. Oh thank you, Rainbow Dash. You saved my life!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh yeah. I did that too. Ha, best day ever!"
Rarity,I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. I guess I just lost my head.
Fluttershy,It's okay.
Applejack,"Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo."
Pinkie Pie,We still love you.
Rarity,And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it. Can you ever ever forgive me?
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, it's okay. Everything turned out all right, right? I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake."
Rainbow Dash,[gasp] Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Spitfire,"So you're the little pony who saved our lives. We really wanted to meet you, and say thanks."
Rainbow Dash,Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Twilight Sparkle,Princess.
Princess Celestia,"Hello, Twilight Sparkle, and hello to your friends too."
Rarity,"Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition. Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria."
Princess Celestia,"I know she is, my dear. That's why, for her incredible act of bravery and her spectacular sonic rainboom, I'm presenting the grand prize for Best Young Flyer to this year's winner, Miss Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!
Princess Celestia,"So Twilight Sparkle, did you learn anything about friendship from this experience?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I did Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me."
Rarity,"I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends."
Princess Celestia,"Excellent. Well done, Rarity."
Rainbow Dash,This really is the best day ever!
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Uhh, hey, Rainbow Crash."
Hoops,Dash!
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Oh! Uhh... Sorry. Rainbow Dash. Uhh, we just wanted to congratulate you on winning the competition."
Hoops,That sonic rainboom was awesome!
Rainbow Dash,"Heh, thanks, guys."
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Uhh, we're really sorry we gave you such a hard time before."
Rainbow Dash,"Aww, that's okay. Don't worry about it."
Others,"""Dumb-Bell"": Hey. Do you want to hang out with us? Maybe you could show us how you did that incredible trick!"
Rainbow Dash,"Sorry, boys... But I've got plans!"
Rarity,"Where'd I put that? Ohh, I thought I already..."
Rarity,"Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to... oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?"
Sweetie Belle,Are you sure I can't help? I could<U+0097>
Rarity,No!
Sweetie Belle,Maybe just a<U+0097>
Rarity,No thanks!
Sweetie Belle,How about<U+0097>
Rarity,Just stand over there.
Sweetie Belle,But<U+0097>
Rarity,"Where you'll be out of the way. Ribbon, ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!"
Sweetie Belle,I got it!
Sweetie Belle,Whoa!
Rarity,Aah!
Sweetie Belle,"Um, I-I'll just go and stand over there, where I'll be... out of the way."
Sweetie Belle,Won't you at least let me help you clean up?
Rarity,No. You've helped me quite enough.
Sweetie Belle,"I'm sorry, sis! I just thought that if I could help, I might find my special gift and finally earn my cutie mark."
Rarity,I understand. It's just that... I need this time to fill this order without any... complications.
Rarity,"Okay, all done. Now, back to work. I've lost a lot of time, and I cannot have any more interruptions."
Rarity,"Oh, what now?!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, sorry. I thought the ""open"" sign meant you were open, but I must have been mistaken."
Rarity,[gasps] Fluttershy! Forgive me! I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!
Fluttershy,"No worries, Rarity. I've left her there in the basket."
Rarity,"Oh, she looks great! I just don't understand how you're able to do it! I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws."
Rarity,Ahh! Did you use... the Stare on her?
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't! I-I don't really have any control over when that happens. I-It just happens. No, I'm just good with animals. It's my special gift, you know?"
Rarity,"Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies."
Sweetie Belle,"Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Maybe I can be good with animals, too!"
Sweetie Belle,Or not.
Rarity,"I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy. I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order."
Sweetie Belle,But you're not eating anything.
Rarity,"No, Sweetie, it's an expression. It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle. I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight! They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning."
Rarity,"See? I've lined them in a special gold silk. It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?"
Fluttershy,"These are lovely, but twenty by tonight? How will you get it all done?"
Rarity,"Well, I, uh..."
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, oh, oh! Maybe I could... just... just stand over here and watch."
Rarity,I'll manage.
Fluttershy,"Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work."
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,"Hi, Fluttershy! Hi, Rarity!"
Rarity,"Hello, uh, girls..."
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,"Hey, Sweetie Belle!"
Sweetie Belle,Scootaloo! Apple Bloom!
Scootaloo,You ready for tonight?
Sweetie Belle,Yup! Cutie mark planning session is a go!
Apple Bloom,Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent.
Scootaloo,Even if it takes us all night!
Apple Bloom,I'm ready! You ready?
Scootaloo,Very ready!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Rarity's! Yay!
Sweetie Belle,And... look what I made us!
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,"Oh, wow! [laughter, gasps] That's so cool! Oooh!"
Fluttershy,What does that patch on your cape mean?
Cutie Mark Crusaders,The Cutie Mark Crusaders! Yay!
Scootaloo,"We're on a crusade, a mission!"
Apple Bloom,To find our cutie marks!
Sweetie Belle,"Yup. And look. I lined them with this special gold silk. It took sooo long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?"
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,Oooooh!
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle! What have you done? That was the last of the gold silk! Oh, now I'll have to make more! Oh, I hope I can make more. I'm gonna have to work all night! Which means... Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled."
Sweetie Belle,What?!
Rarity,I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time.
Sweetie Belle,But<U+0097>
Rarity,"No buts this time. I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. It's just the way it has to be."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Awwww...
Fluttershy,"I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night."
Rarity,I couldn't ask you to do that.
Fluttershy,"Oh, it's no problem at all."
Rarity,Have you met my sister and her friends? A problem is all it would be.
Fluttershy,Did I have a problem with Opal? You've seen how well I handle small creatures!
Rarity,I suppose that's true... and I do have a lot of work to do...
Fluttershy,"Come on, it'll be fun."
Rarity,"I assure you, they're quite a handful."
Fluttershy,These sweet little angels?
Rarity,Well... all right.
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Fluttershy's cottage! Yay!
Fluttershy,So cute. W-wait for me!
Rarity,Hmmm...
Fluttershy,"Oh, won't this be ever so fun? We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hello, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,"Oh! Hello, Twilight. Where are you off to?"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's to get some of my favorite tea.
Fluttershy,"Th-The Everfree Forest? Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?"
Twilight Sparkle,Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls?
Fluttershy,"Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover."
Twilight Sparkle,Wow. Sounds like everypony has their hooves full today. Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself? You sure you can handle it?
Fluttershy,What? These sweet little angels? They'll be no problem at all.
Sweetie Belle,Wow! Look at this place! What's that? Are those chickens?
Fluttershy,"[to herself] No... problem at all. [normal] Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?"
Scootaloo,I'm gonna get my mark first!
Fluttershy,Girls?
Sweetie Belle,Nuh-uh!
Fluttershy,Should we<U+0097>
Apple Bloom,I am!
Fluttershy,"Girls, okay, now settle<U+0097>"
Scootaloo,I'm staying up all night!
Apple Bloom,"Me, too!"
Sweetie Belle,"Me, three!"
Fluttershy,"I-I know you're excited, but<U+0097> girls, oh, oh, careful with the<U+0097> oh, ah, girls<U+0097> [huffs] So! What do you wanna do? Play a game?"
Scootaloo,We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Apple Bloom,And we want to crusade for our cutie marks!
Sweetie Belle,"And, and, and, we, um<U+0097> yeah! What they said!"
Fluttershy,"Mmm, I don't know... how about a nice quiet little tea party?"
Scootaloo,Or... we could go adventuring in the Everfree Forest!
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Yeah!
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous. It's filled with far too many strange creatures."
Sweetie Belle,"But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures. We could be, umm... creature catchers!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Yay! Cutie Mark Crusader creature catchers!
Scootaloo,Arrrr! I am a dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest! Rrrarr!
Sweetie Belle,"Halt, dangerous creature of the Everfree Forest. I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher, and I'm here to catch you!"
Scootaloo,You can never catch me! I am far too powerful and dangerous!
Sweetie Belle,You cannot run from me!
Scootaloo,Raaaar!
Fluttershy,"Um, oh, maybe that's not such a<U+0097> now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring? Doh<U+0097>"
Sweetie Belle,"Come back, dangerous creature, so I can catch you!"
Scootaloo,Never!
Fluttershy,Careful... you don't...
Fluttershy,...break anything.
Sweetie Belle,"Sorry, Fluttershy."
Scootaloo,"Yeah, sorry."
Apple Bloom,I guess we aren't creature catchers.
Fluttershy,"Oh, girls, it's okay. I<U+0097>"
Apple Bloom,I know! We could be Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters!
Fluttershy,C-carpenters?
Apple Bloom,Hammer!
Scootaloo,Hammer.
Sweetie Belle,Hammer!
Scootaloo,Hammer. Hammer! ...Hammer.
Sweetie Belle,Um ... that doesn't look like a table.
Scootaloo,We were making a table?
Apple Bloom,Somepony needs to put this thing out of its misery.
Scootaloo,We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters.
Sweetie Belle,Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank anyway?
Fluttershy,"Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?"
Apple Bloom,A game?
Fluttershy,"It's called ""Shhh!"""
Scootaloo,What's that?
Scootaloo,I lose!
Sweetie Belle,Me too!
Apple Bloom,Me three!
Apple Bloom,"Okay, now what can we do? Oooh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Yeah!
Fluttershy,No!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Awwww!
Fluttershy,"I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think? Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?"
Apple Bloom,Snuggly-wuggly? But we have more crusadin' to do!
Scootaloo,We've got plans!
Sweetie Belle,And capes!
Fluttershy,"Um, okay, um. Maybe the crusading can wait until morning? When it's light? And not so... dark?"
Apple Bloom,How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?
Fluttershy,[blows out candle] Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent.
Scootaloo,But we're not even tired!
Fluttershy,How about I sing you a lullaby?
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Mm-hmm, yeah!"
Fluttershy,"Hush now, quiet now It's time to lay your sleepy head Hush now, quiet now It's time to go to bed"
Sweetie Belle,I know this one!
Fluttershy,"Oh, how wonderful! Why don't you sing it with me?"
Sweetie Belle,Hush now! Quiet now! It's time to lay your sleepy head! Said hush now! Quiet now! It's time to go to bed!
Fluttershy,"Okay Sweetie, that was..."
Sweetie Belle,Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep! Exciting day behind you! Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep! Let the joy of dream land find you!
Fluttershy,"Thank you Sweetie, um..."
Sweetie Belle,Hush now! Quiet now! Lay your sleepy head! Said hush now! Quiet now! It's time to go to bed!
Others,Ow!
Scootaloo,What is that?
Fluttershy,[gasp] Girls!
Apple Bloom,"Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!"
Sweetie Belle,I wonder what could have caused that...
Scootaloo,"Don't worry, Fluttershy, the Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this!"
Sweetie Belle,Cutie Mark Crusader chicken herders! Yay!
Fluttershy,"No, I don't think that's a<U+0097> ah, come back! Please!"
Fluttershy,"Come on, girls, the chickens are fine<U+0097> oh, girls, um... girls!"
Fluttershy,"Come on, in you go."
Fluttershy,"There's some good chickens. Okay, you three. Isn't it about time you got into bed?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,But<U+0097>
Fluttershy,Please?
Fluttershy,"So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?"
Scootaloo,"Yes, Fluttershy!"
Sweetie Belle,"We promise, Fluttershy!"
Apple Bloom,"Good night, Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy,"Okay, good night."
Sweetie Belle,"Okay, so what kind of crusading do we do next?"
Apple Bloom,There's not much we can do from this room... unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader cottage cleaners.
Sweetie Belle,"N-no, thanks."
Apple Bloom,"Well, we have to think of somethin'. We can't just waste this opportunity to find out what our special talents are. Hey, girls! Look! Some of the chickens may have escaped!"
Sweetie Belle,Into the forest!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,[whispering] Cutie Mark Crusaders chicken rescuers are go!
Fluttershy,"[sigh] It really wasn't that hard ... I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge. Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy! Good with animals, good with kids."
Scootaloo,[whispering] Wait up!
Fluttershy,"Mmm, peace and quiet. [gasps] Too quiet. [gasps] Girls? Girls? Elizabeak! She's missing! Girls?! [gasps] Oh, no! They must have gone looking for my missing chicken! Which means... they must have gone into... [gasp] [gulp] The Everfree Forest!"
Apple Bloom,"Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick! Brawck, bawk-bawk-bawk, brawck!"
Scootaloo,What are you doing?
Apple Bloom,Callin' for the chicken!
Scootaloo,That is not how you call a chicken.
Apple Bloom,"Oh, and you know how to call a chicken?"
Scootaloo,I know that's not the way.
Apple Bloom,Then show me.
Scootaloo,I don't have to show you!
Apple Bloom,You're just chicken!
Scootaloo,Am not!
Apple Bloom,"Oh, wait, now I know how to call a chicken! Scootaloo! Scoot-scootalooooo!"
Scootaloo,That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
Apple Bloom,You also forgot how to call a chicken!
Scootaloo,"Why, you..."
Sweetie Belle,"Come on, guys, we're not gonna find the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing."
Apple Bloom,Maybe that's our special talent. Arguin'!
Scootaloo,Is not!
Apple Bloom,Is too!
Scootaloo,Is not!
Apple Bloom,Is too! Anything yet?
Scootaloo,Nope.
Apple Bloom,Darn.
Apple Bloom,"Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick, baaawk, bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk, b-baaaaawk!"
Fluttershy,"[whispering] Girls? [gulp] Girls? [tiny terrified squeak] Oh! Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy. Just put one hoof in front of the other."
Fluttershy,Ahh! What was that?
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! If you've been turned to stone, it must mean<U+0097> oh! Oh no, the girls! Don't move. I'll be back for you. Girls!"
Scootaloo,Is not!
Apple Bloom,Is too!
Scootaloo,Is not!
Apple Bloom,Is too!
Sweetie Belle,"Girls! Our special talent is not arguing. Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony whose talent is arguing even look like?"
Fluttershy,Girls? Girls?
Sweetie Belle,Fluttershy?
Fluttershy,Girls! Thank goodness I found you!
Apple Bloom,"Fluttershy, what<U+0097>"
Fluttershy,"Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!"
Sweetie Belle,But... we haven't found the chicken yet!
Fluttershy,There's no time for that. There's a cockatrice on the loose!
Apple Bloom,A cocka-what now?
Fluttershy,"A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake. Now, come on!"
Scootaloo,"The head of a chicken and the body of a snake? That doesn't sound scary, that sounds silly!"
Apple Bloom,"Why, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was."
Fluttershy,No! Never look one in the eye!
Fluttershy,If you look a cockatrice in the eye<U+0097>
Apple Bloom,The chicken!
Fluttershy,Girls! Wait!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!"
Others,[chicken clucking
Sweetie Belle,There he is!
Scootaloo,Two chickens?
Apple Bloom,I thought only one escaped!
Sweetie Belle,Grab them both!
Fluttershy,See? Now we have to<U+0097>
Fluttershy,"Girls, please. Girls<U+0097> now listen to me, girls, I<U+0097> please!"
Fluttershy,"Girls! Behind me, now!"
Fluttershy,"You! Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?"
Fluttershy,"You should be ashamed of yourself. I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man. Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again. Do you understand me?"
Fluttershy,Are you girls all right? I was so worried!
Scootaloo,"Yeah, fine!"
Sweetie Belle,Thanks to that stare of yours.
Scootaloo,You're like the queen of stares. You're the<U+0097>
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Stare Master!
Sweetie Belle,We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest.
Apple Bloom,Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.
Scootaloo,We promise.
Fluttershy,"Oh, you do, do you? Well, you better, or I'll give you... the Stare!"
Twilight Sparkle,What... what happened?
Fluttershy,And that's when it brought you back from stone.
Twilight Sparkle,This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess. I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls.
Fluttershy,"Oh, I wouldn't go that far."
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm? How so?
Fluttershy,"I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals. Boy, was I wrong. I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew."
Twilight Sparkle,"You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity."
Fluttershy,Did you finish all those capes?
Rarity,"[sigh] Just delivered them. I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have. Thanks again."
Fluttershy,Won't you stay for some tea?
Rarity,I really must get back to the shop and clean up. Girls! Get your things. Time to go. Girls!
Rarity,Girls! Time to<U+0097> Girls! Your things! Girls! It's time to<U+0097> Girls!
Fluttershy,Allow me. [clears throat] Girls?
Apple Bloom,"Yes, Fluttershy."
Scootaloo,You called?
Fluttershy,Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home.
Sweetie Belle,"Of course, Fluttershy, right away!"
Rarity,"Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?"
Fluttershy,I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Thank you, Fluttershy! Bye! Thank you, Stare Master!"
Rarity,"Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal."
Fluttershy,Of course. How about later today?
Apple Bloom,Where are you takin' us?
Applejack,"We're almost there, young'uns."
Sweetie Belle,I've never been here before.
Scootaloo,Ouch!
Apple Bloom,Oh. Sorry.
Scootaloo,Are we there yet?
Sweetie Belle,There? Where? What? I don't even know what we're doing.
Applejack,Here we are.
Apple Bloom,What are we lookin' at?
Scootaloo,I have no idea.
Sweetie Belle,What is that thing?
Applejack,"Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse. [silence] Well, don't thank me all at once. This was my clubhouse when I was your age. Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm. And it's all yours. It just needs a little, uh... TLC."
Scootaloo,TLC as in Tender Loving Care or Totally Lost Cause?
Apple Bloom,Applejack! We're supposed to turn this into our new clubhouse?
Applejack,"Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for... Waaah! [crash] Uh... house cleanin'?"
Granny Smith,Soup's on!
Apple Bloom,"Whoa! Hi, Scootaloo! Back already? You're amazin' on that scooter."
Scootaloo,"Thanks! Wow, Apple Bloom. You did all of this?"
Apple Bloom,"Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted..."
Scootaloo,That's so cool. What's Sweetie Belle up to?
Apple Bloom,"There you are, Sweetie Belle! See? I told you we could find her by following her totally awesome voice."
Scootaloo,What's that sweet tune you're singing?
Sweetie Belle,Oh. I was just working on our new Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,Cool!
Scootaloo,Teach us?
Sweetie Belle,"Well, I've only come up with one part... but okay!"
Sweetie Belle,They all say that you will get your mark When the time is really right
Apple Bloom,And you know just what you're supposed to do
Scootaloo,[loud and off-key] And your talent comes to light!
Applejack,"Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders. You've done one fine job with this place. So, what's next?"
Apple Bloom,"Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse..."
Scootaloo,...and a map of Ponyville...
Sweetie Belle,...and a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song...
Applejack,Theme song?
Apple Bloom,We're gonna go out in the world and discover our talents.
Scootaloo,A new adventure!
Sweetie Belle,And earn our cutie marks.
Apple Bloom,We'll leave no stone unturned!
Scootaloo,No mountain unclimbed!
Sweetie Belle,No meal uncooked!
Apple Bloom,No sock unworn!
Applejack,"Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan. I gotta, uh... Leave no apple unpicked! See y'all later!"
Scootaloo,"Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Ready!
Spike,I had nothing to do with this.
Twilight Sparkle,What is going on here?
Apple Bloom,"Hmm... Well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians."
Spike,Huh. I should think not. What?
Twilight Sparkle,"Girls, I think you're going about this the wrong way. Instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like?"
Cheerilee,And I have the perfect place to start.
Apple Bloom,"""Showcase your talents..."""
Scootaloo,"""...for all to see."""
Sweetie Belle,"""Perform in the Ponyville school talent show!"""
Cheerilee,"There'll be all sorts of awards. Best dramatic performance, best comedy act, best magic act... Surely you can find your talent."
Apple Bloom,This would be the perfect place to discover our talents. Jugglin'!
Scootaloo,Acting!
Sweetie Belle,Magic tricks!
Apple Bloom,Square dancin'!
Scootaloo,Tightrope walking!
Sweetie Belle,Tiger taming!
Twilight Sparkle,My little ponies! You're missing the point. Think about the things you already enjoy doing. Think about what you're already good at.
Scootaloo,Sure! We can do that.
Sweetie Belle,Yeah! Sure we can.
Apple Bloom,"Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,...The Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Rarity,Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things. Come back with my supplies!
Sweetie Belle,"We're just borrowing them for the talent show. Don't worry, sis. I promise we'll bring them back."
Scootaloo,"Thanks, Mr. Breezy. We'll return the fan to you real soon."
Apple Bloom,What do we need this fan for?
Sweetie Belle,Trust me on this one.
Scootaloo,"Okay, so that's six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes. Anything else?"
Sweetie Belle,"Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes."
Twilight Sparkle,"""Ghosts, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures""? Good heavens, girls. What do you need a book like this for?"
Scootaloo,"You'll see. Thanks, Twilight. We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it."
Twilight Sparkle,What do you think they're up to?
Spike,I have no idea and I don't know if I should be excited or scared to find out.
Apple Bloom,I'm glad we're doin' this as a team.
Sweetie Belle,Me too. Um... so what are we doing again?
Scootaloo,"A super awesome dramatic song for the talent show, of course."
Sweetie Belle,Right! With super-cool scenery. And amazing costumes!
Apple Bloom,And mind-blowin' dance moves.
Scootaloo,This is gonna be soo amazing!
Apple Bloom,"Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer."
Sweetie Belle,"What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd. Twilight said to do something we like to do, and I'd like to be like my big sister, and she's a designer."
Scootaloo,Fine then. You can do the costumes and the scenery.
Apple Bloom,"And Scootaloo, you're great in maneuvers on your scooter. So you should do the choreography. Y'know, all those dance moves."
Scootaloo,"Nah. I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad. Why don't you come up with the dance routine, Apple Bloom?"
Apple Bloom,Hm... I'm not much of a dancer... but I do like Kung-fu. That's kinda like dancin'. Hi-ya! Hah! Hah! Yah!
Sweetie Belle,Then it's settled! Let's get started.
Apple Bloom,One... two... three... Oh! Oh!
Scootaloo,"Ow, Apple Bloom! What are you doing?"
Apple Bloom,"Oh, I feel like I have four left feet. I can't even spin right."
Scootaloo,"Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head forward until the very last minute, like this. See? Easy-peasy. You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all."
Apple Bloom,Wow! That does look easy. Thanks. Okay. Let's try this again. Oh! Ouch! Ow. I'm okay!
Scootaloo,Keep practicing!
Apple Bloom,Will do.
Scootaloo,"We fight the fight, walk the walk. Talk the talk, eat the... uh... food like a celery stalk? Ugh! I'll never come up with anything! Never, never, never!"
Sweetie Belle,"Come back! Come back! Uh. Dumb fabric. Hey, Scoot! How's the song going?"
Scootaloo,Pbbbt.
Sweetie Belle,Pbbbt? Oh my! Sounds serious.
Scootaloo,"I'm just no good at lyrics. Coming up with words is, like... [pause] really hard."
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, it can't be that bad. ""With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria. We use our stomachs to... digestia""? Umm... Well... These are... um... good, but... How about after ""we fight the fight""... There is nothing that we fear We'll have to figure out what we'll do next 'Til our cutie marks are here"
Scootaloo,Wow! That's so awesome! Did you just come up with that now?
Sweetie Belle,Yeah... kind of.
Scootaloo,"Thanks, I'm totally using that."
Sweetie Belle,Oh no!
Apple Bloom,Ouch!
Sweetie Belle,How's the spin coming along?
Apple Bloom,"I think I gotta just stick to punches and kicks. You know, ponies only have four legs."
Sweetie Belle,[moan] I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity.
Apple Bloom,"Hey, it's no big deal. Why don't you use the dress form? It'll help you with your patterns and help you put all the pieces in the right places."
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, is that what that's for?"
Apple Bloom,Uh... maybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color.
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, I was wondering why all the colors looked like mud."
Apple Bloom,"You're not using power tools, are you?"
Applejack,The talent show is just around the corner. I wonder how the fillies are doin'.
Apple Bloom,"Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo."
Scootaloo,That's okay. Ugh!
Sweetie Belle,"Oops! Sorry, Scootaloo. Ouch!"
Scootaloo,"Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle. Let's sing the chorus again!"
Applejack,"Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that."
Apple Bloom,I think that sounded pretty good.
Sweetie Belle,Me too. You think we're ready?
Scootaloo,Ready as we'll ever be. Hey! Did you see us practicing?
Applejack,Uh... Yeah.
Apple Bloom,Well? How'd we do? How'd we do?
Applejack,Uh...
Scootaloo,"Speechless! See, girls? I told you that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna leave them speechless."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Yay!
Applejack,"""Speechless"" is right."
Snips,"...And on the count of three, this rabbit will disappear, and something tasty will reappear in its place. A one, a two, and a three! Hey! Where are they? Snails, where are the... carrots. SNAILS!"
Cheerilee,"Uh, how about a round of applause for the S&S magic act? Now for our next act, we have Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem... on roller skates!"
Sweetie Belle,Break a leg!
Apple Bloom,Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!
Sweetie Belle,"No, no, no. You see, in the theater it's considered bad luck to say ""good luck"". So you say ""break a leg"" instead."
Twilight Sparkle,My little ponies! How are you doing?
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Nervous...
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing. Remember, just stick to what you know best. I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle."
Sweetie Belle,Why does everypony always think I'm gonna sing?
Scootaloo,"Actually, Twilight Sparkle, I'm the main singer tonight."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh?
Apple Bloom,And I'm the main dancer. Hi-ya!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh?
Sweetie Belle,And I'm in charge of...
Twilight Sparkle,Costumes?
Sweetie Belle,And sets and props. How'd you know?
Twilight Sparkle,"Really, girls? Are you sure...?"
Cheerilee,"Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next. Break a leg."
Twilight Sparkle,Break a le<U+0097>
Apple Bloom,Ugh!
Twilight Sparkle,Uh... good luck!
Scootaloo,"Look, here, are three little ponies, Ready to sing for this crowd, Listen up, 'cause here's our story I'm gonna sing it"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Very loud!
Scootaloo,When you're a younger pony And your flank is very bare Feels like the sun will never come When your cutie mark's not there
Others,So the three of us will fight the fight There is nothing that we fear We'll have to figure out what we'll do next
Cutie Mark Crusaders,'Til our cutie marks are here!
Others,We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders On a quest to find out who we are And we will never stop the journey Not until we have our cutie marks
Scootaloo,They all say that you'll get your mark When the time is really right And you know just what you're supposed to do And your talent comes to light
Others,But it's not as easy as it sounds And that waiting's hard to do So we test our talents everywhere
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Until our face is blue
Others,We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders On a quest to find out who we are And we will never stop the journey Not until we have our cutie marks
Others,We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders On a quest to find out who we are And we will never stop the journey Not until we have our cutie marks!
Scootaloo,Wow. That did not go as well as I expected.
Apple Bloom,I can't believe they're laughin' at us.
Sweetie Belle,Was it that bad?
Cheerilee,"Back on stage, girls. It's time for the awards."
Sweetie Belle,Back on stage? No.
Apple Bloom,They'll just laugh some more.
Scootaloo,"Yeah, what's the point?"
Cheerilee,"Now girls, let's be good sports. You made a great effort. You should be proud. Now come on!"
Cheerilee,Let's hear it for all our talented fillies and colts.
Cheerilee,Our first award goes to... Snips and Snails for best magic act.
Snips,Hey! Mine's at least shinier.
Snails,"Well, mine's bigger."
Snips,"Oh yeah, well... Well, mine is, um... heavier?"
Cheerilee,The next award goes to... Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie for best dramatic performance.
Cheerilee,"And finally, the last award of the night goes to... the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,What?
Cheerilee,For best comedy act.
Apple Bloom,Can you believe it? We won!
Scootaloo,I knew our act was awesome.
Sweetie Belle,You know what would be the best? If we won and we got our cutie marks.
Twilight Sparkle,"Congratulations, ponies! Job well done."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"[sadly] Thanks, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, you don't sound too excited."
Scootaloo,"[sigh] We worked really hard and won a prize, but we still don't have our cutie marks."
Sweetie Belle,Which is the prize we really wanted.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, girls..."
Apple Bloom,But we think we know why.
Sweetie Belle,Yes. We know why.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make a special report to the Princess.
Sweetie Belle,"Well, maybe we were trying too hard."
Twilight Sparkle,Yes? And?
Scootaloo,And instead of forcing ourselves to do something that's not meant for us...
Twilight Sparkle,Yes? Yes?
Apple Bloom,We each should be embracing our true talent!
Twilight Sparkle,And that is...?
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Comedy!
Applejack,Apple Bloom! You did it!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Did you see our award? Weren't we funny?
Twilight Sparkle,One day... [giggle] One day...
Rarity,Perfect!
Rarity,"Coming! Welcome to Carousel Boutique, where every garment is chic, unique, and magnifique. [gasp] Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop!"
Sapphire Shores,"Good afternoon, Miss Rarity!"
Rarity,You yah... Y-y-you know my name?
Sapphire Shores,"Well, of course I do, darling. I make it a point to know all of the up-and-coming designers and Clothes Horse magazine simply raved about you."
Rarity,"Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up. How may I help you, Miss Shores?"
Sapphire Shores,"Oh please, call me Sapphire."
Rarity,"[giggle] How may I help you, Sapphire?"
Sapphire Shores,"Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be touring all of Equestria with my latest concert, Sapphire Shores' Ziegfilly Follies, so I need to look seeensational! Ow!"
Rarity,"I have just what you need. Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the pi<e8>ce de r<e9>sistance de la haute couture. I used every last diamond I found on this one garment."
Sapphire Shores,[gasp] And it is spectacular! I'll take it.
Rarity,Really?
Sapphire Shores,"Oh yes, and five more, each done up in a different jewel."
Rarity,Beg pardon?
Sapphire Shores,Costume changes.
Sapphire Shores,"[chuckle] Yes, I do have that effect on ponies."
Spike,"Oh my gosh! Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop! She is awesome! I mean, she's gorgeous and talented and <U+0097> heh... and not even half the pony you are. I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous and talented and<U+0097>"
Rarity,"Spike, a lady is never jealous."
Spike,"Eh, of course not. But were you totally flipping out or what?!"
Rarity,"Ladies do not ""flip out"", Spike. However, I was quite in awe. Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. Oh, aha!"
Spike,Did you find some?
Rarity,"Yes, Spike! Right there!"
Spike,Ooooo! You look so delicious...
Rarity,"Spike! I promised I'd give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire."
Spike,"Hm... I will miss you, my sweets."
Rarity,"Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find."
Spike,"At your service, milady."
Rarity,Spike!
Rarity,"You've been very patient today, Spike. And for that you get the finest reward. This is from me to you."
Rarity,"Is something wrong, Spike?"
Spike,No. It's perfect.
Rarity,"Ooo, bring the cart, Spike. There are more over here."
Spike,For me. From Rarity.
Rover,"Yesss, gemsss. Gemsss!"
Fido,Where?
Rover,Preciousss gemsss! He is the gem hunter. With him we can have all those gems... and more! Let's get the dragon.
Rarity,Spike! Where are you?
Rover,Wait! Who is that?
Rarity,"You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting."
Spike,Coming!
Spike,Jackpot!
Rover,"Oh, it's not the dragon we want. It's the pony!"
Diamond Dogs,The pony...
Rarity,"Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today. And these will certainly get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits. Why don't we start headi... Oh! What's this? Another jewel. Oh.. Oh, strange. It's in the trees. Oooo... Ewww! Uh... uh... Good day, gentle... uh, fellow. Uh, I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike."
Spike,Ehe...
Rarity,And you are...
Rover,A Diamond Dog.
Rarity,"Oh really? Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. I mean I-I-I know that diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know that they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha. So, um, [cough] you're out hunting for gems as well?"
Rover,Yes. We hunt.
Rarity,Uh... we?
Rover,We hunt for gems. But you are a better hunter. So now we hunt... for you!
Spot,Yaaaaah!
Spike,"[grunt] Run, Rarity! Run! Aaaah! Uh!"
Fido,Ooooooh!
Spot,Yaaaaah!
Rarity,Spike! Come on! Hurry!
Rover,Gotcha!
Rarity,Waah! Spike!
Spike,"Got him, Rarity! I got him!"
Fido,Haha! Nope!
Spot,"Sorry, scaly one."
Spike,Wait! Rarity?
Rarity,"Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop! Put me down, you thugs! You brutes!"
Spike,[gasp] Rarity!
Rarity,"Spike! Ah, dirt! Aaaaah, Spiiiike!"
Spike,"Which, what, where?"
Rarity,Save me...!
Spike,Nooooooooooo!
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, can you breathe now?"
Spike,Yes... [pant] I think so.
Twilight Sparkle,Good. Now tell us what you know.
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. 'Cause all you said earlier was...
Spike,[pant] Aaaah! Rarity... woods... jewels... dogs... hole... taken... Save her!
Applejack,"Not a whole lot to go on there, sport."
Spike,Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.
Twilight Sparkle,Creepy guys?
Spike,They called themselves the Diamond Dogs. They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground.
Applejack,"Well, this sounds mighty easy. Just take us to that there hole and we'll save Rarity."
Pinkie Pie,"Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys."
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, girls! Let's get started."
Twilight Sparkle,Hello?
Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] Puh!
Rainbow Dash,Yuck! Ugh!
Spike,Puh!
Twilight Sparkle,Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up.
Fluttershy,"Oh! Oh my. Oh, oh!"
Applejack,We can't muscle through it!
Applejack,"Whew. Heavens to Betsy. Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off, but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Rarity..."
Rarity,"Oh, woe is me! Whatever shall I do? Ah! Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop, make it stop! Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings, it burns. Help! Oh, somepony save me, save me!"
Applejack,We gotta save her.
Fluttershy,But they blocked up all the holes.
Applejack,Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!
Pinkie Pie,Ow!
Fluttershy,Oof!
Spike,[panting] Whoa! Oof!
Rainbow Dash,Get 'em!
Pinkie Pie,Whoooaaa!
Rainbow Dash,Come on!
Fluttershy,"All those scary monsters popping up everywhere. Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified."
Twilight Sparkle,[worryingly] Ooh.
Spot,Give me the baubles!
Rarity,Ah!
Fido,Give me the beads!
Rarity,Aah!
Rover,Where are the trinkets?!
Rarity,Aaaah!
Diamond Dogs,Where is the treasure?!
Twilight Sparkle,Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?
Spike,"I got it! I'll save you, my sweet."
All,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, it is very noble of you..."
Spike,Shhh!
Twilight Sparkle,[quieter] ...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.
Spike,"Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress."
Sir Spike,"I shall save you. Show yourselves, you dogs! You curs! Ah. There you are, you mangy mutts."
Sir Spike,"Now, where is Lady Rarity?"
Lady Rarity,[gasp] Spike! I knew you would save me!
Sir Spike,"Nothing could stop me, milady."
Sir Spike,Mmmmmm...
Applejack,"Hoho there, lover boy."
Spike,Whoa! Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa... I got a bite! I got a bite!
Applejack,"Hold on there, little fella."
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack!
Rainbow Dash,Twilight!
Fluttershy,"Oh my goodness, oh my goodness..."
Pinkie Pie,Wait for me!
Fluttershy,Oh!
Pinkie Pie,Whee!
Pinkie Pie,"Whee! Ha, ha, ha!"
Spike,"Oh, oh!"
Spike,"Ha ha, it worked! We're in! Now we can finally save Rarity!"
Twilight Sparkle,Um... Which way do we go?
Spike,Nooooooooooo!
Twilight Sparkle,All these tunnels... How are we ever gonna find Rarity?
Applejack,Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.
Rainbow Dash,That could take forever! There's gotta be way to narrow it down.
Spike,I know! I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems.
Twilight Sparkle,"But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems."
Spike,"No, Twilight. You can! You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh my gosh! You're right! Rarity showed me how she did it a while back. If I can just remember...
Spike,"That's it. You did it, Twilight! Come on! We're coming, Rarity. We'll save you. Just hold on."
Rarity,"Oh please, Diamond Dogs. Please let me go."
Spot,No!
Fido,You're our precious little pony.
Rover,Forever! Muhahahaha!
Rarity,But whatever do you want from me?
Rover,Gemsss!
Spot,Yes! The gems. The jewels.
Fido,Find them! Find them all!
Rarity,Oh! Is that all?
Rarity,"There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, if you'd be so kind as to show me the exit?"
Rover,"Good! [laugh] Now, dig them up, pony."
Rarity,What? But you said you wanted me to find the gems.
Spot,Yes! Find and then dig.
Rarity,Dig?
Fido,Yes. Dig.
Fido,What are you doing? We said dig!
Rover,"Oh, for goodness<U+0097> Fine! Just stop. Stop! Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast."
Fido,"She won't dig, she pulls."
Rarity,"I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?"
Fido,Others will dig. You will haul the wagon.
Spot,Prrrecious pony-pedi will be preserved.
Rarity,"Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things!"
Rover,Please be quiet!
Rarity,"Good heavens, what is that smell?"
Rover,Smeeeeeell?
Rarity,"Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath."
Rover,"Enough! Search, pony!"
Rarity,"Well, since you insist... But I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is stifling, suffocating. And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated."
Rarity,"You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? You could all do with a good round of soap and water. Oh water, oh water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?"
Spot,"Good gracious, I can't take this anymore. Be quiet, pony!"
Rarity,"And that's another thing. I would appreciate if you stopped calling me ""pony"". I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such. So you may call me ""Miss"" or ""Rarity"" or ""Miss Rarity""."
Rover,Enough! Your whining! It-it-it hurts!
Rarity,"Whining? I am not whining. I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? Thiiis iiis whiiining! Oooh, this harness is too tiiight! It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it? Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a staaain! And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?!"
Spot,Aaah! Make it stop!
Rover,Stop whining!
Rarity,But I thought you wanted whiiining!
Rover,"Geh! We'll do anything, pony!"
Rarity,[dreamily] Anything?
Rarity,[sigh] This water is hardly sparkling. But I suppose it will have to do.
Rover,[panting] Wait! Why are we doing this?
Rover,"Yes, yes, I know. This is ridiculous! Letting a pony order us around. What are we? Mice or dogs?"
Fido and Spot,Mi... dogs?
Rover,Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull. Let her make the awful noises.
Rarity,"What are you doing? Hey, you spilled my drink. Oh! [whining] Not sooo tiiight!"
Rover,"Ha! Make the noises all you want. But move while you make them. Hyah, mule!"
Rarity,Did you just call me a... mule?
Rover,Ehh...
Spot,What are these noises?
Rarity,He called me ugly!
Rover,No! Mule! I said mule!
Rarity,"An old ugly mule! And it's true! Just look at me. I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow..."
Fido,"No, no! You're still beautiful, po... uh, Miss Rarity."
Rarity,You're just saying that!
Spot,"No, you're still pretty and... and..."
Rover,"Oh, uh, uh, nice. Yeah."
Rover,"Oh, I've had just about enough of this!"
Twilight Sparkle,We're getting close. I can feel it.
Spike,It's coming from down here. Come on!
Rainbow Dash,She must be in there. Let's go!
Mook dogs,More workhorses.
Applejack,"Hoh, doggies. If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride. Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out. Buck 'em up, buck 'em down."
Applejack,"Yeehaw! Get along, little doggies!"
Spike,"I'm coming for you, milady. Hi-ho, Twilight! Away!"
Twilight Sparkle,And just what do you think you're doing?
Spike,"Please, Twilight. Just give me this."
Spike,"Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!"
Twilight Sparkle,Excuse me?
Spot,So picky.
Fido,And critical.
Spot,She won't stop talking.
Fido,And crying.
Rover,"We, uh, give her back. Yes."
Spike,Rarity! You're safe!
Rarity,"Why, yes. Hello, girls. You arrived just in time to assist me."
Applejack,Assist you with what?
Rarity,With those.
Spike,You're letting her leave with all these... jewels?
Rover,Yes. Take them. And her with them.
Spot,Please!
Pinkie Pie,I can't believe you found all these gems!
Rainbow Dash,Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.
Rarity,Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation. I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.
Twilight Sparkle,I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today.
Rarity,Me? What did I teach you?
Twilight Sparkle,"Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. In fact, by using her wits, a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all."
Spike,"Hm... ""Outshines"" is right. Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores' costumes."
Rarity,"Not if you eat them all, Spike."
Rarity,"So sorry, Fluttershy. I hate being late for our weekly get-together. The usual!"
Rarity,But you will not believe what happened to me.
Fluttershy,Is everything all right?
Rarity,"Oh, it's much more than all right. I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street but Photo Finish!?"
Fluttershy,Photo Finish?
Rarity,"She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria. Anywho, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!"
Fluttershy,What a lovely compliment.
Rarity,She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!
Fluttershy,[squee] That's wonderful.
Rarity,[vibrating] Do you know what this could mean for my fashion career?
Fluttershy,"Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you."
Rarity,But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me. Somepony with beauty. Somepony with grace. Somepony... like you?
Fluttershy,"Oh, goodness. I don't know."
Rarity,"Oh, this is such a huge opportunity. And it would mean so much to me."
Fluttershy,"I'm flattered, really."
Rarity,Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
Fluttershy,But...
Rarity,Nopony!
Fluttershy,There has to be somepony more quali-
Rarity,Please!
Fluttershy,Somepony more into fashion.
Rarity,Please!
Fluttershy,Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight.
Rarity,"Please, please, pleeease!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it."
Rarity,"Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! You are the best friend a pony could ever have!"
Fluttershy,[sigh] What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
Rarity,Isn't it? Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled. I think I feel a pimple coming on. Oh! Only one solution! The usual!
Rarity,Hm... She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.
Fluttershy,"A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz."
Rarity,"More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster. Oh, and the headdress needs more feathers. Pinkie Pie! More feathers! And sequins! More sequins!"
Rarity,And more ribbon! Oh no! Less ribbon. No! More ribbon.
Rarity,"Oh, this hem is completely off. Pincushion! Thank you all for helping me. I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm... I'm just so nervous."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, doesn't that hurt?"
Spike,"Thick scales. Can't feel a thing. And even if I could, there is no pain that would keep me from assisting the most beautiful creature in the world. I'm gonna tell you two a secret. But you have to promise not to tell anyone."
Twilight Sparkle,I promise.
Pinkie Pie,"Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye."
Spike,I have a crush on Rarity!
Pinkie Pie,[gasp] We won't say a word!
Twilight Sparkle,Give me a break. Everypony already knows how you-
Pinkie Pie,Twilight! You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything. He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!
Twilight Sparkle,But-
Pinkie Pie,Forever!
Twilight Sparkle,My lips are sealed. Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings.
Photo Finish,"I, Photo Finish... have arrived."
Rarity,"Let me just say, what an honor!"
Photo Finish,We begin... now!
Rarity,Attitude and pizzazz!
Photo Finish,Yes! Show Photo Finish something. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. Enough!
Twilight Sparkle,She hardly took any pictures.
Fluttershy,I'm so sorry. I tried my best.
Rarity,"Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle. I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her."
Photo Finish,"It seems that I, Photo Finish, have found the next fashion star here in Ponyville."
Rarity,Really?
Photo Finish,"Yes. Really. And I, Photo Finish, am going to help her to shine all over Eqvestria. Tomorrow, a photo shoot in ze park. [pause] I go!"
Rarity,"Did you hear that? I am going to ""shine all over Equestria""."
Fluttershy,"Oh, Rarity. I was so worried I'd ruined everything."
Rarity,"No, no, no, yes! That is definitely the one. Photo Finish is going to love it. Everypony is going to love it!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, I am so excited for you. Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria."
Rarity,Never.
Photo Finish,"Put me down here. Oh, nonononononono. The model should be in something simple! Something inspired by... the nature!"
Rarity,"That's just what I was thinking. Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together."
Photo Finish,Yes... that will not be necessary.
Rarity,"But... but... how are you going to help me ""shine across Equestria"" if I don't design something new for these pictures?"
Photo Finish,I am not going to help you shine across Equestria. I am going to help her shine. She is my star. You! Go!
Fluttershy,"I can't, Rarity."
Rarity,"Oh, but you must, Fluttershy. Photo Finish wants to make you a star. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. You must do this for me. You must. You must! You must!"
Photo Finish,"Floottershy! It is time to make... the magics! Oh, wunderbar! You are like a delicate flower. So much more alluring without all those sparkles und feathers."
Pinkie Pie,How'd it go? How'd it go?
Rarity,"It didn't. Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do?"
Rarity,I just vant to be alone right now.
Spike,You heard her. She vants to be... alone. What? I didn't think she meant alone alone.
Photo Finish,Too much blush. Not enough. Too much. Not enough. Perfect.
Photo Finish,"Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are graceful. Now go! How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed? Thrilled beyond your wildest dreams?"
Fluttershy,N... nervous.
Photo Finish,Nervous? Dun be ridiculous. You're only facing a large crowd of ponies who will be watching your every move and silently judging you.
Photo Finish,Your cue! Now go!
Background voice,No seriously...
Fluttershy,You can't let Rarity down. You must do this. You must. You must. You must.
Lyrica Lilac,So graceful.
Royal Ribbon,So lovely.
Hoity Toity,So perfect for my new advertisement.
Shoeshine,It's Fluttershy!
Rarity,Wow. Look how popular you are. I'm so excited for you. You must be having the best time ever.
Fluttershy,"Oh, yes. Best time ever..."
Photo Finish,Floottershy! I have been looking for you everywhere. We have the thing at the place.
Fluttershy,I'll see you at the spa? Our usual time?
Rarity,"Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the... ""thing at the place""."
Rarity,I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go.
Rarity,Welcome to Carousel Boutique!
Sweetie Drops,Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here.
Rarity,Sorry. You just missed her. But you're still in luck. I'm having a huge sale on some of my best designs.
Sweetie Drops,And you are...?
Rarity,"Rarity, of course."
Sweetie Drops,Never heard of you.
Photo Finish,"Obviously I, Photo Finish, am thwilled to have found her."
Fluttershy,Photo Finish?
Photo Finish,She's a natural in front of the camera.
Fluttershy,Um... Photo Finish?
Photo Finish,"I only need to point and shoot, and I capture... the magics!"
Fluttershy,"Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt. It's just that I'm running late."
Photo Finish,[gasp] How could I have forgotten?! Your appearance at the ballet opening! Everypony who is anypony will be there.
Fluttershy,"Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend..."
Photo Finish,We go!
Rarity,"My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long. Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm sure she just got tied up.
Rarity,Of course she did. She's a big bright shining star! I wish that star would burn out.
Twilight Sparkle,Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.
Rarity,"I know, I know. And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just... jealous! Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way. Please, please, pleasepleaseplease!"
Twilight Sparkle,You have my word. Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.
Pinkie Pie,Forever!
Twilight Sparkle,Wow! You look great!
Rarity,"Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous."
Fluttershy,"Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm... Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?"
Twilight Sparkle,Sorry.
Twilight Sparkle,Feel better?
Fluttershy,[sighs] No. Can I tell you something?
Twilight Sparkle,Of course.
Fluttershy,You promise not to tell Rarity?
Twilight Sparkle,I swear.
Fluttershy,Pinkie Pie Swear?
Twilight Sparkle,"Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my [poke] Ooowwwww!"
Fluttershy,"I don't like being a model. No, I hate being a model. All this attention is awful, just awful. And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must. I must! I must! [sigh] I must..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity..."
Fluttershy,"Oh, what were you about to say?"
Pinkie Pie,[quietly] Forever!
Twilight Sparkle,Nothing!
Twilight Sparkle,"I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit."
Fluttershy,"Oh, no. I could never do such a thing. Rarity would be devastated."
Pinkie Pie,[chomp] Mmm... Juicy!
Twilight Sparkle,Uhhhhhh!
Fluttershy,"Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much. Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with... the magic!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I guess you're right. [pause] You're right. You're right, you're right, you're right!"
Gala Appleby,It's Fluttershy!
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive. But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive at her next fashion show, no one will ever want her to model again. And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets! It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. Promise me you won't tell anyone?"
Twilight Sparkle,So you do promise or you don't?
Twilight Sparkle,Obviously.
Fluttershy,You really think it'll work?
Twilight Sparkle,They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you not be you. Just leave it to me.
Rarity,Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
Fluttershy,Oof!
Fluttershy,[gasp] Ooh... Aah!
Rarity,Oh no.
Golden Harvest,Get her off the stage!
Lemon Hearts,She's an embarrassment to all things fashion!
Photo Finish,"I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!"
Rarity,Bravo! I say bravo!
Lyrica Lilac,Bravo? Who could possibly say bravo to that horrid display?
Rarity,Such attitude! Such pizzazz! She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! Bravo!
Lyrica Lilac,Who is saying these things?
Royal Ribbon,It's her. The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress.
Lyrica Lilac,"Now that is a pony who clearly knows a thing or two about fashion. Well, if that fabulous pony likes it, then I do too! Bravo!"
Fluttershy,"This is awful. Just awful! Somehow I've become more popular than ever. Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!"
Fluttershy,If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh! But Rarity...!
Rarity,Fluttershy! Are you all right?
Fluttershy,I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great?
Twilight Sparkle,Because you ha...!
Rarity,"Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... Oh... Oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful. I wanted them to."
Fluttershy,You did?!
Twilight Sparkle,Of course she did! Because...!
Rarity,"I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you. I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?"
Twilight Sparkle,But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh!
Fluttershy,"Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model."
Rarity,You do?
Fluttershy,More than anything.
Rarity,Then why did you keep doing it?
Fluttershy,"I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to... ""shine all over Equestria""."
Rarity,"And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend."
Fluttershy,Never!
Rarity,All this time!
Fluttershy,If we'd just told each other the truth.
Rarity,I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.
Fluttershy,Me too.
Photo Finish,You were brilliant. Brilliant! I've already got six photo shoots lined up for tomorrow alone.
Fluttershy,"I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them."
Photo Finish,Whaaat?
Fluttershy and Rarity,We go!
Photo Finish,Vat has just happened?
Twilight Sparkle,Spike has a crush on Rarity!
Pinkie Pie,[sigh] And you were doing so well.
Fluttershy,Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
Rarity,"Isn't it, though?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend. Did you get all that, Spike?"
Spike,No. I did not. I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity.
Twilight Sparkle,"You're right. That was wrong of me, and I'm very sorry."
Spike,Apology accepted.
Twilight Sparkle,Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia?
Spike,I would love to. But... I'm a little busy at the moment.
Applejack,"And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, ""Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore."" So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The... end."
Rarity,Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?
Applejack,"Heh... uh... Well, ya know, bein' replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree... and Bloomberg here is one of my favorites."
Rarity,"No fair, Applejack! You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies. How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?!"
Applejack,But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip. He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.
Rarity,Hmph! You talk about it as if it's your baby or something.
Applejack,"Who you callin' a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby! Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy. Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree. Yes, he is. A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!"
Rarity,"It's widdle Rarity who's all ""saddy-waddy""! Urgh!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh man, we're going fast! This is so exciting, I can't even wait!"
Twilight Sparkle,Oh my goodness...
Rarity,[sigh] For crying out loud in the morning!
Spike,"[groan] Do you guys mind? I was up early fire-roasting those snacks you're all eating, and I'm pooped!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped."
Spike,"Okay, fine..."
Rainbow Dash,Ghk...
Spike,Good night!
Twilight Sparkle,Uhh... maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
Others,"Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Awwww!"
Rainbow Dash,"[whispering] Psst! Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet?"
Pinkie Pie,"[whispering] No, are you asleep yet?"
Rainbow Dash,"[whispering] If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep?"
Rainbow Dash,"[whispering] When we get to Appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard?"
Pinkie Pie,[whispering] What tree? You mean Bloomberg?
Rainbow Dash,"[whispering and sarcastically] ...No, Fluttershy."
Pinkie Pie,"[whispering] Fluttershy's not a tree, silly!"
Twilight Sparkle,What's going on?
Pinkie Pie,Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!
Rainbow Dash,[whispering] I do not think she's a tree! I was just<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,Did you say she was a tree?
Rainbow Dash,[whispering] No. Well.. Yes. But not exactly<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,"Ya know she's not a tree, right?"
Pinkie Pie,"She's not a tree, Dashie!"
Fluttershy,I'd like to be a tree...
Spike,"Oh, for Pete's sake!"
Twilight Sparkle,Well that was kind of huffy.
Fluttershy,Huffy the magic dragon!
Rarity,Would you all be quiet... now?!
Twilight Sparkle,A buffalo stampede!
Rarity,I just love their accessories!
Twilight Sparkle,They're getting awfully close to the train.
Rarity,I want to speak to the manager!
Pinkie Pie,"Oooh, looky! Now they're doing tricks! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a backflip!... Or... Just jump?"
Rainbow Dash,Hmm.. Something tells me this isn't a circus act. Hey there!
Rainbow Dash,"Where ya headed in such a hurry? Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so... bulky. No offense."
Little Strongheart,Huh..?
Applejack,[gasp] They've got Bloomberg!
Spike,Heeeelp!
Twilight Sparkle,And Spike!
Rainbow Dash,Ugggh..
Spike,[distant] Heeeelp!
Rainbow Dash,Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her! Ow...
Braeburn,Hey there! Welcome ta A-A-ppleloosa!
Applejack,"Braeburn, listen<U+0096>"
Braeburn,"Cousin Applejack, mind yer manners, you have yet ta introduce me to your compadres! Shame on you!"
Applejack,"Braeburn, listen, somethin' terrible's happened<U+0096>"
Braeburn,"Terrible is right, your train is a full seven minutes late! That's seven minutes less for you to delight in the pleasures and wonders of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built all this in just the past year, don't it?! And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts. Like horse-drawn carriages!"
Others,"""Black Stone"": Okay, you pull now."
Noteworthy,"Aww, we just switched."
Braeburn,And those there are horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages.
Applejack,"...Listen, Braeburn, I<U+0096> Oof!"
Braeburn,"And here's our local waterin' hole, the Salt Block."
Others,"""Morton Saltworthy"": That's enough salt for you!"
Ol' Salt,Ol' Can't I at least... get a glass of water?
Braeburn,Over there's the office of Sheriff Silverstar. And here's where we have our wild west dances! And here's where we have our mild west dances!
Applejack,"But, Braeburn, we<U+0096>"
Braeburn,And here's the most wonderful sight in all of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Our apple orchard.
Applejack,Braeburn!
Braeburn,First harvest should be any day now.
Applejack,Braebu<U+0096>
Braeburn,Good thing too!
Applejack,Brae<U+0096>
Braeburn,'Cause we need that grub to live on.
Applejack,Braeburn!
Braeburn,"Uh, yes, cuz?"
Applejack,"You have a very nice town an' all, but we have a hu-uge problem! Some of our friends are missin'!"
Fluttershy,A stampede of buffalo.
Rarity,They took Spike!
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash went after them!
Fluttershy,And we can't find Pinkie Pie.
Applejack,"And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!"
Braeburn,"Did you say... buffalo? [sigh] Them buffalo, they want us settler ponies to take every single tree you see here off this land. They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in."
Fluttershy,But why?
Braeburn,"Beats me. We put a lot of hard work into this land, so we can feed our town, our families, our foals! And now they're sayin' all these trees have to go? T'ain't fair..."
Rainbow Dash,"Ooh, I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo... Hnnh... Ow! Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it."
Pinkie Pie,Boo!
Rainbow Dash,Yah! ...Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie,"Ah, ya caught me! Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either! You're good."
Rainbow Dash,Shhshh! What do you think you're doing?! You gotta get out of here!
Pinkie Pie,I do?
Rainbow Dash,You're gonna blow my cover.
Pinkie Pie,I am?
Rainbow Dash,I'm trying to save Spike!
Pinkie Pie,Oh my gosh! So am I!
Rainbow Dash,"And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting... caught. Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off. Save yourself!"
Spike,"Stop! Dash, Pinkie, 'sup? Hey, no worries, I know those guys. They're cool."
Buffalo,"If you say so, Spike. Catch ya later, bro."
Spike,"Seems they took me by mistake. And they feel awful about it too, poor guys. Fortunately, they totally respect dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest."
Rainbow Dash,[sniff] Ugh...
Spike,"Still don't like ponies much, though... But you're with me, so it's cool."
Rainbow Dash,"Huh. Well, I still don't trust them. I say we turn tail and bail while we still<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"Mmm! [munching] Before we finish eating? Are you loco in the coco?! Can I please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was?"
Little Strongheart,"Certainly. And, Mr. Spike, you like gemstones, yes?"
Spike,"Turquoise. Mmm! [munching] Heh hah! This here is Little Strongheart, and these are my friends Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,You!
Little Strongheart,You!
Rainbow Dash,That's it! We are outta here!
Little Strongheart,Wait! Please accept my apologies for what happened on the train. We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, right."
Little Strongheart,"We only wanted the tree. The settler ponies have overtaken the land and have planted an orchard all over it! Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer run over our traditional stampeding grounds."
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie,Huh?
Spike,I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves.
Chief Thunderhooves,"Hmmh. We have a long and winding stampeding trail that we have run upon for many generations. [breath] My father stampeded upon these grounds, and his father before him, and his father before him, and his father before him, and his father before him, and<U+0096>"
Little Strongheart,"I think they get the idea, Chief."
Little Strongheart,They planted apple trees all over it without asking our permission.
Pinkie Pie,"Well that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,Hmph...
Little Strongheart,"The ponies refused to move their trees, so we are stuck here, and it is not fair!"
Spike,"See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,Huh... Ah!
Rainbow Dash,I'll say they had a good reason! C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosans to talk to!
Rarity,"Ow! [groaning] Gently, please!"
Applejack,"Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta' be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em! Let's go!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hi, guys!"
Fluttershy,Pinkie! We're so glad you're safe.
Twilight Sparkle,How did you escape from the buffalo?
Pinkie Pie,We didn't!
Rainbow Dash,We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
Applejack,"Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?"
Rainbow Dash,We brought our new pal Little Strongheart here to explain to the Appleloosans why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.
Braeburn,That information would be quite help<U+0096>
Applejack,That's weird. 'Cause my cousin Braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.
Little Strongheart,That would be a useful thing to<U+0096>
Rainbow Dash,"The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all."
Braeburn,Well... heh...
Applejack,"They busted their rumps here! An' now they're supposed ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?"
Rainbow Dash,Plant the trees somewhere else!
Applejack,Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts!
Rainbow Dash,The buffalo had it first!
Applejack,The settler ponies need it to live!
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Applejack!"
Applejack,[over Rainbow Dash] You're bein' unreasonable!
Rainbow Dash,[over Applejack] I put my hoof down!
Twilight Sparkle,Look! Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land. There must be something we can do.
Pinkie Pie,Hey! I've got an idea!
Pinkie Pie,"We may be divided But of you all, I beg To remember we're all hoofed At the end of each leg"
Others,No matter what the issue Come from wherever you please All this fighting gets you nothing But hoof-and-mouth disease
Others,"Arguing's not the way Hey, come out and play! It's a shiny, new day So, what do you say?"
Others,You gotta share You gotta care It's the right thing to do You gotta share You gotta care And there'll always be a way through
Others,"Both our diets, I should mention Are completely vegetarian We all eat hay and oats Why be at each other's throat?"
Others,You gotta share You gotta care It's the right thing to do And there'll always be a way Throoooough!
Spike,"[applauds] All right, Pinkie Pie! That was fantastic! What a great song! Yeah, right on!"
Chief Thunderhooves,It appears that Sheriff Silverstar and I have come to... an agreement.
Sheriff Silverstar,We have.
Chief Thunderhooves,That was the worst performance we've ever seen.
Sheriff Silverstar,Teh... Abso-tively!
Chief Thunderhooves,"The time for action... Hmh... is upon us! Our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow. And if the orchard is still there, we'll flatten it... and the whole town!"
Little Strongheart,"But, Chief!"
Sheriff Silverstar,"An' we Appleloosans say you'd better bring yer best, 'cause we'll be ready and waitin'."
Braeburn,"But, Sheriff..."
Pinkie Pie,Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all...
Applejack,I want my kin ta' have what they need to live... but a storm's a-brewin' here. And I don't like the look of it.
Twilight Sparkle,"We've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt. Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we<U+0096>"
Rarity,About the trees. Now if you could<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,If we could just sit down and talk we could<U+0096>
Goldengrape,Grrrrr!
Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!
Applejack,"Sheriff, if we could only<U+0096>"
Spike,Isn't there someway to stop this?
Little Strongheart,"Unless the settlers remove those trees, I do not think so."
Rainbow Dash,I know you don't want to do this.
Chief Thunderhooves,"But they have taken our land. What would you have me do, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,I don't know... but it's never too late to think of something.
Chief Thunderhooves,"At noon, it will be too late."
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, think! Think, think, think, think, think, think, think!"
Rainbow Dash,[gasp] He's not gonna do it!
Pinkie Pie,<U+0096>what do you say? You gotta share You gotta care It's the right thing to do
Chief Thunderhooves,Grrr... You gotta share
Chief Thunderhooves,Chaaarge! You gotta care
Pinkie Pie,Wah-ahh! Whoa-oo-oo-oo-ooa!
Sheriff Silverstar,Ready... aim... fire!
Sheriff Silverstar,Ah! Aah!
Chief Thunderhooves,[distorted] Nooo!
Chief Thunderhooves,"Yum! Hey, I've got a much better idea!"
Chief Thunderhooves,"We... will allow the apple orchard to stay in exchange for a share of its fruit, heh... Those... delicious apple pies!"
Spike,I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week. [chomp] Auhh...!
Applejack,"Bloomberg, this is yer special day. Mama's so proud of you!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. You've got to share. You've got to care.
Pinkie Pie,Hey! That's what I said!
Fluttershy,"There you go, Mr. Mousey. Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you. And it will be just like new in no time at all."
Fluttershy,"Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help."
Fluttershy,You... found a watch? You... wanna be a watch? You're running! Running out of time? No. You're... late?
Fluttershy,"[gasp] I'm late for a very important date! The big brunch for Princess Celestia at Sugarcube Corner. Oh, the princess is here in Ponyville for a party, and we all promised we'd be there. But I'm not there! Oh, do I look all right? Do I need to bring anything? Maybe I shouldn't go."
Fluttershy,Aah! It's starting! I'm missing it!
Fluttershy,"Oh, thanks, Angel. I mean, if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered, and then I wouldn't be there, and everypony would be wondering where I was and... Oh, right. I'm late."
Fluttershy,"Oh, okay then. See you later."
Rainbow Dash,"So... what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway? Is the pay good? Hellooo? Anybody home? [babbles] Wah-wah! [babbles] Ooh, you're good. [pause] Too good. I'm bored."
Guard 1,Halt!
Guard 2,Who goes there?
Fluttershy,[gulp] No one. Never mind. I'll go home.
Twilight Sparkle,"It's all right, sirs. She's on the list."
Fluttershy,"Thanks, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you."
Mr. Cake,Mr. How's everypony doing? Good? Good.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Anything else we can get for you, dearies...? Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests."
Princess Celestia,"Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake."
Fluttershy,Sorry I'm late. I had to finish taking care of a patient first.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, you and your tender loving care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you. I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will!"
Fluttershy,"Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, it's not that. I just want the princess to approve of my friends."
Fluttershy,But she's met us all before.
Twilight Sparkle,And read about you in my letters. But this is the first time she's spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression.
Fluttershy,"Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?"
Rarity,"Don't touch me! Watch the dress! Careful, you're gonna spill that on me! Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it? Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!"
Fluttershy,Or... perhaps not that casual.
Applejack,"Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first? Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry."
Fluttershy,"It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect. I doubt the princess will even notice."
Pinkie Pie,Hey!
Mr. Cake,"Mr. A thousand pardons, Your Majesty."
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Uh, I see it, honey bun!"
Princess Celestia,"Oh, um... thank you."
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Not at all, Your Highness."
Princess Celestia,[sips] Thank you again.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, but of course, Your Majesty."
Princess Celestia,[sips] [sips] [sips] Gotcha!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh...
Princess Celestia,"And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?"
Fluttershy,"Me? Oh yes, Your Highness."
Princess Celestia,I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.
Fluttershy,"Yes, I love to take care of animals."
Princess Celestia,"As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small."
Princess Celestia,Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.
Princess Celestia,"Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts."
Fluttershy,Oh... my.
Princess Celestia,"She is quite a sight, isn't she?"
Fluttershy,I... I... I've never seen anything like it.
Princess Celestia,"Really? Well, if I must... I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better."
Applejack,Phew! Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved! Oh...
Rarity,"Stay right where you are. All I want is a clear path to the exit. Nobody move and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[sigh] Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened."
Fluttershy,"Oh, you poor little thing. How did you ever get in such bad condition? Don't you worry, Philomena. I'll nurse you back to health. As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly."
Fluttershy,This is far worse than I thought. What you need is some medicine. Stat!
Fluttershy,"Here you go, Philomena. This will fix you right up."
Fluttershy,Doctor Fluttershy expected that.
Fluttershy,Always works. [gasp] Uh... Almost always.
Fluttershy,"There's nothing like homemade soup to cure what ails you. Come on now. You're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate. Mmm... See? It's delicious. Good and good for you. Here comes the choo-choo train. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!"
Fluttershy,"Oh dear. Don't worry, Philomena. I know what'll make you feel better. Wait right here. I have just the thing."
Fluttershy,"Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. Didn't you, boy?"
Fluttershy,Say hello to your new friend Philomena.
Fluttershy,"Your turn now, Philomena. Go ahead. You can do it. [vocalizes My Little Pony theme] Oh! Um... good try?"
Fluttershy,"I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat. A humidifier. [deep breath] Refreshing. How's that feeling now for you, Philomena? Better?"
Fluttershy,Oh... That's okay. I know lots of other ways to take care of you. Don't worry. You're gonna get better. How about...
Fluttershy,Aromatherapy?
Fluttershy,Warm bath?
Fluttershy,Ointment?
Fluttershy,Scalpel. Surgical tape. Feathers.
Fluttershy,"Oh, Philomena. I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. I've tried everything I know. And look at you. You're worse than ever."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hi, Fluttershy! I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today... [gasp] What is Celestia's pet doing here?!"
Fluttershy,I couldn't leave the poor thing there. She needed my help.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh no. Nonononononono! This is bad.
Fluttershy,How could I just walk away and not do anything?
Twilight Sparkle,But... but... she doesn't belong to you!
Fluttershy,I had to do something.
Twilight Sparkle,Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?!
Fluttershy,But...
Twilight Sparkle,"I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return the princess's pet!"
Fluttershy,But...
Fluttershy,"[sigh] You're right. Okay, let's..."
Fluttershy,...go.
Guard 1,We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here.
Guard 2,"We regret to inform you, miss, that the royal pet has gone missing."
Twilight Sparkle,It's that dry night air?
Fluttershy,But it's daytime.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well... day air's even drier. You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet. Philomena, was it? Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. Bye! [pants] Phew... What are you doing?!"
Fluttershy,"Going to return Philomena, remember?"
Twilight Sparkle,We can't now!
Fluttershy,Why not?
Twilight Sparkle,"You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!"
Fluttershy,Do you?
Twilight Sparkle,Well... no. But it can't be anything good. She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to!
Fluttershy,You really think the princess would do that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?"
Fluttershy,All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well.
Twilight Sparkle,That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. Unless I'm banished too somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?
Fluttershy,"Please, Twilight. You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the princess. And everything will be fine."
Twilight Sparkle,Did you give her any kind of medicine?
Fluttershy,"I tried to, but she wouldn't take it."
Twilight Sparkle,"[groan] Then you have to make her take it. You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy! You need to show this patient who's the boss. Make her straighten up and fly right!"
Fluttershy,She can't fly.
Twilight Sparkle,No excuses!
Twilight Sparkle,"Done. Okay, what else?"
Fluttershy,"Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean."
Twilight Sparkle,There you go.
Fluttershy,I don't think she likes it.
Twilight Sparkle,"Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you?"
Fluttershy,"Of course, but..."
Twilight Sparkle,Next!
Fluttershy,"Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put."
Twilight Sparkle,One step ahead of you.
Fluttershy,"It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise. Please, just relax and try to get some sleep."
Twilight Sparkle,What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.
Fluttershy,I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, she'll eat it, all right."
Twilight Sparkle,Hey! Where are you going?
Fluttershy,No! Philomena! Come back!
Rainbow Dash,"What are you two doing? Are you having a race? Oh, can I play? One, two, three, go!"
Fluttershy,Excuse me!
Pinkie Pie,Hi!
Twilight Sparkle,Beg your pardon!
Rarity,Put me down!
Applejack,What in tarnation?!
Fluttershy,"Sorry, but we've gotta find..."
Guard,The princess's pet bird!
Fluttershy,"Philomena, come down from there! You'll hurt yourself!"
Fluttershy,I'll catch you!
Princess Celestia,What is going on here? Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident."
Fluttershy,It's all my fault.
Twilight Sparkle,"No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was my fault."
Fluttershy,I'm the one who did it.
Twilight Sparkle,But you were only trying to help.
Fluttershy,Some help I was.
Twilight Sparkle,Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.
Fluttershy,But it's my fault!
Twilight Sparkle,"No, it's my fault!"
Pinkie Pie,"No, it's my fault! Wait, what are we talking about?"
Fluttershy,"Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but... Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird. I really was only trying to help the poor little thing. Then I was gonna bring it right back to you, honest. So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve."
Princess Celestia,"Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony."
Fluttershy,I don't understand! What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?
Princess Celestia,"This is Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena?"
Fluttershy,A... A phoenix?
Princess Celestia,"A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame. [silently] Rather melodramatic, if you ask me. [loud again] It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy. All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix. I'm afraid mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy. Say you're sorry, young lady."
Fluttershy,So... aren't you gonna banish me? Or throw me in a dungeon? Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?
Princess Celestia,"Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea?"
Fluttershy,I guess I have some imagination.
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you.
Princess Celestia,"And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble."
Fluttershy,I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.
Twilight Sparkle,"Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?"
Princess Celestia,"No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember."
Fluttershy,"It's beautiful. Thank you, Philomena. No hard feelings."
Rainbow Dash,"Hmm... [indistinct whispers] Hey, you know what you should do? You should go over there and tickle them!"
Sweetie Belle,"[gulp] Are you sure about this, Scootaloo? I've never even heard of a pony zip lining before."
Scootaloo,"Neither have I, but Spike told me it was awesome!"
Scootaloo,Whoa!
Sweetie Belle,Oh!
Apple Bloom,Wah!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Ow!
Apple Bloom,See anything?
Scootaloo,Tree sap and pine needles but no cutie mark.
Sweetie Belle,Plan B?
Scootaloo,"Yeah. You know where we can find a cannon at this hour? It's no use! No matter what we try, we always end up without our cutie marks. And, surprisingly often, covered in tree sap."
Sweetie Belle,"Maybe we should do something less dangerous, like pillow testing or flower sniffing."
Apple Bloom,This town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks. Why don't we ask them how they did it?
Sweetie Belle,That's a great safe idea.
Scootaloo,Yeah! And we can start with the coolest pony in Ponyville.
Apple Bloom,Applejack!
Sweetie Belle,Rarity!
Scootaloo,"Come on, guys, I said ""cool""! You know who I'm talking about. She's fast. She's tough. She's not afraid of anything!"
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Pinkie Pie?
Scootaloo,No! The greatest flyer ever to come out of Cloudsdale.
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Fluttershy?
Scootaloo,No! Rainbow Dash!
Apple Bloom,"Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense."
Sweetie Belle,Of course!
Scootaloo,Let's do it. Let's find out how Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark!
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Yeah!
Sweetie Belle,Aah! Uuh!
Applejack,"Get back here, you thievin' varmints!"
Apple Bloom,Thievin' what now?
Applejack,Apple Bloom?
Apple Bloom,Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark?
Applejack,I never told you that story?
Scootaloo,Hey! I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash.
Apple Bloom,We need all the help we can get.
Scootaloo,Ugh. Fine.
Applejack,"Why, shoot. I was just a little filly. Even littler than y'all."
Applejack,"[voiceover] I didn't want to spend my life on a muddy old apple farm. I wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange. So I set out to try my luck in the big city, Manehattan! The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria."
Count Caesar,"Hey! Outta the way, you rube!"
Applejack,[voiceover] I knew I'd find out who I was meant to be in Manehattan.
Young Applejack,Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange! Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay!
Aunt Orange,"""Y'all"". [laughs] Isn't she just the living end?"
Uncle Orange,[chuckle] How quaint.
Aunt Orange,Don't worry. We'll have you acting like a true Manehattanite in no time.
Tall Order,And how are you finding good old Manehattan?
Young Applejack,"Oh, it's simply divine."
Aunt Orange,"Very well said, my dear."
Young Applejack,"Although, I must admit the city noise took some getting used to. Where I'm from, nights are so quiet, you seldom hear a peep until the roosters wake you."
Dane Tee Dove,The... what?
Tall Order,"I say, my dear, what in the world is a ""rooster""?"
Young Applejack,[voiceover] What's he talking about? What do I say? I don't wanna look like a fool.
Pony,Dinner is served.
Young Applejack,Thank goodness. Being a city pony's hard work. I'm so hungry I could eat a...
Young Applejack,"Cock-a-doodle-doo... Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith and Big McIntosh are up to. I bet they're applebuckin' their way through the Red Delicious trees. Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite..."
Applejack,[voiceover] I never felt so homesick in all my days as I did right then.
Applejack,"[voiceover] It was amazin'! A rainbow pointin' right back to... home. In that moment, it all became clear. I knew right then just who I was supposed to be. That's when this here appeared."
Applejack,I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since.
Applejack,"There they are! Get back here, ya thievin' varmints!"
Sweetie Belle,Aw. That was such a sweet story!
Scootaloo,Sweet? Try sappy. [mock-gags] Come on! We've got to find Rainbow Dash and hear the cool way to get a cutie mark.
Fluttershy,"All right, little ones. This way. This way. You really should be more careful. Somepony could get hurt. Why are you in such a hurry anyway?"
Scootaloo,"We're trying to find Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she earned her cutie mark."
Fluttershy,"Oh, that would be interesting. You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her."
Scootaloo,Rainbow Dash?! Really?!
Fluttershy,Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.
Fluttershy,"[voiceover] You'd never guess, but when I was little I was very shy. And a very weak flyer."
Others,"Young ""Dumb-Bell"": [laughter] Nice going, ""Klutzershy""! They oughtta ground you permanently."
Young Hoops,Ha! My baby brother can fly better than you!
Fluttershy,"[voiceover] It was the most humiliating moment of my life. And then, out of nowhere..."
Young Rainbow Dash,Leave her alone!
Young Hoops,"Ooh, what are you gonna do, ""Rainbow Crash""?"
Young Rainbow Dash,Keep making fun of her and find out!
Others,"Young ""Dumb-Bell"": You think you're such a big shot? Why don't you prove it?"
Young Rainbow Dash,Whaddya have in mind?
Young Hoops,You're going down!
Young Rainbow Dash,"In history, maybe. See you boys at the finish line!"
Young Fluttershy,[screaming] Huh?
Fluttershy,[voiceover] I had never seen such beautiful creatures. Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home. And I'd never been near the ground before.
Young Fluttershy,What is this place Filled with so many wonders? Casting its spell That I am now under
Others,Squirrels in the trees And the cute little bunnies Birds flying free And bees with their honey
Others,Hooooonneeeeeeey!
Others,"Oooh, what a magical place And I owe it all to the Pegasus race If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve<U+00A0> I'd have come here sooner, and never leave"
Others,"Yes, I love ev-er-ythiiiiing!"
Young Fluttershy,Shhh. It's okay. You can come out. Everything's okay. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Fluttershy,[voiceover] Somehow I had the ability to communicate with the animals on a different level.
Scootaloo,"Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Rainbow Dash? What about the race?"
Fluttershy,"Oh. Well, I wasn't there, so I don't really know what happened."
Scootaloo,"Come on, Crusaders. We've gotta find her. Besides, I can't take anymore singing."
Sweetie Belle,"Maybe my sister knows where she is. Bye, Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy,"Bye, girls!"
Scootaloo,"How did we get roped into this? Oh, we'll never hear Rainbow Dash's story."
Rarity,Are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks?
Sweetie Belle,Of course! Most of the fillies at school already have theirs.
Rarity,"Mmm, I know how you feel. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I didn't have mine."
Rarity's teacher,"Rarity' Well done, Rarity. Your costumes are very nice."
Young Rarity,Nice?! They need to be spectacular! And the performance is tomorrow!
Rarity,"[voiceover] I tried every trick I could think of, but nothing seemed to work. The costumes just weren't right. And the play opened that night."
Young Rarity,Maybe I'm not meant to be a fashionista after all... Aah! What's going on?!
Rarity,[voiceover] I had no idea where my horn was taking me. But unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason. I knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark! I knew that this was... My destiny!
Young Rarity,"A rock?! That's my destiny?! What is your problem, horn? I followed you all the way out here for a rock?! [groans] Dumb rock!"
Young Rarity,Ooh!
Scootaloo,Ugh! These namby-pamby stories aren't getting us any closer to our cutie marks! They're all about finding who you really are and boring stuff like that.
Rarity,"Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly..."
Scootaloo,"Come on, girls! We need action! We need Rainbow Dash!"
Twilight Sparkle,"As a young filly in Canterlot, I always wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration, where Princess Celestia raises the sun."
Twilight Sparkle,"[voiceover] And I saw the most amazing, most wonderful thing I've ever seen."
Twilight Sparkle,[voiceover] I poured myself into learning everything I could about magic.
Twilight Sparkle,[voiceover] My parents decided to enroll me in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. It was a dream come true! Except for one thing... I had to pass an entrance exam!
Crystal Clear,"Well, Miss Sparkle?"
Crystal Clear,"Well, Miss Sparkle?"
Crystal Clear,We don't have all day.
Twilight Sparkle,"[voiceover] I knew it was the most important day of my life, that my entire future would be affected by the outcome of this day and I was about to blow it!"
Young Twilight Sparkle,I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Young Twilight Sparkle,Aah!
Princess Celestia,Twilight Sparkle.
Young Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean..."
Princess Celestia,You have a very special gift. I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities.
Young Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Princess Celestia,But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study.
Young Twilight Sparkle,Huh?!
Princess Celestia,"Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal prot<e9>g<e9> here at the school."
Young Twilight Sparkle,Huh?!
Princess Celestia,Well?
Young Twilight Sparkle,Yes!
Princess Celestia,"One other thing, Twilight."
Young Twilight Sparkle,More? My cutie mark! Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes...
Twilight Sparkle,...yesyesyesyes...
Apple Bloom,"Okay, okay."
Sweetie Belle,"We're happy for you, Twilight."
Scootaloo,"Yeah, thrilled. Let's get out of here while we still can."
Twilight Sparkle,"...yesyes, yeeees!"
Cherry Fizzy,Are you okay?
Twilight Sparkle,[giggle] Um... yes.
Scootaloo,Ugh! Why don't we ever smash into Rainbow Dash?!
Pinkie Pie,"You're looking for Rainbow Dash? If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Of course, if I was anyone, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Hey! I have an idea! Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, we're sort of looking for Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she got her cutie mark."
Pinkie Pie,Cutie mark? Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine!
Scootaloo,[sigh] Why not?
Pinkie Pie,All right!
Pinkie Pie,"[voiceover] My sisters and I were raised on a rock farm outside of Ponyville. We spent our days working the fields. There was no talking. There was no smiling. [sigh] There were only rocks. We were in the south field, preparing to rotate the rocks to the east field when all of a sudden..."
Pinkie Pie,"[voiceover] I'd never felt joy like that before! It felt so good I just wanted to keep smiling forever! And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too, but rainbows don't come along that often. I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?"
Igneous Rock Pie,We better harvest the rocks from the south field.
Cloudy Quartz,Pinkamena Diane Pie! Is that you?
Young Pinkie Pie,Mom! I need you and dad and the sisters to come in. Quick!
Young Pinkie Pie,Surprise! You like it? It's called... a party!
Young Pinkie Pie,Oh. You don't like it. [gasp] You like it! I'm so happy!
Pinkie Pie,And that's how Equestria was made!
Scootaloo,Wha... huh?
Apple Bloom,Look! We're here!
Pinkie Pie,Maybe on the way home I can tell you the story of how I got my cutie mark. It's a gem!
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie."
Scootaloo,Ugh...
Scootaloo,Rainbow Dash! You're here!
Rainbow Dash,I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story.
Scootaloo,[sigh] You have no idea what I've been through today to hear that story.
Rainbow Dash,It all happened during the race at Flight Camp...
Rainbow Dash,[voiceover] ...where I stood alone against all odds to defend Fluttershy's honor.
Rainbow Dash,"[voiceover] I've never flown like that before! That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt! The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane... I liked it... a lot!"
Young Rainbow Dash,Ow!
Young Hoops,"Ha! Later, Rainbow Crash!"
Young Rainbow Dash,Hey!
Rainbow Dash,[voiceover] Turns out the only thing I liked more than flying fast... was winning!
Rainbow Dash,[voiceover] Most people thought that the sonic rainboom was just an old mare's tale. But that day... The day I discovered racing... I proved that the legends were true. I made the impossible happen!
Rainbow Dash,"And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Whooooaaaa...
Fluttershy,"Wait a second. I heard that explosion. And I saw the rainbow too. Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark."
Pinkie Pie,"I heard that boom! And right afterwards, there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile."
Applejack,"When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home. I bet it was your sonic rainboom!"
Rarity,There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark.
Twilight Sparkle,"This is uncanny! If that explosion didn't happen when it did, I would have blown my entrance exam. Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me earn my cutie mark too!"
Rainbow Dash,Whoa!
Pinkie Pie,We all owe our cutie marks to you!
Fluttershy,Do you realize what this means? All of us had a special connection before we even met.
Rarity,We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it!
Applejack,"Come here, y'all."
Mane Six,AWWW!!!
Fluttershy,I'm so glad we're friends!
Pinkie Pie,"I love you, guys!"
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Awwww...
Fluttershy,Hey. How about a song?
Pinkie Pie,Definitely!
Scootaloo,Nooooo!
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"Today I learned something amazing. Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. Who knows? Maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow."
Spike,Gross! When did you get so cheesy?
Twilight Sparkle,"Just write it, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle,This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!
Spike,Awesome!
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, this shower only happens once every 100 years."
Spike,A centennial celebration!
Twilight Sparkle,We better get a move on!
Spike,"Don't wanna be late! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [sigh] There."
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?"
Spike,Check!
Twilight Sparkle,Scrolls?
Spike,"Check! I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch, and my freshly baked homemade triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[giggle] I can see that. Once again you've read my mind, Spike. And that is why you are my number one assistant."
Spike,I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
Twilight Sparkle,That is why you are my number one assistant.
Spike,Missed that! Huh...?
Twilight Sparkle,"I said... [giggle] Come on, let's get going. Wait! I almost forgot! I wanna bring the ""Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy""."
Spike,The Astronomo-lomo homono what?
Twilight Sparkle,"You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the universe...?"
Twilight Sparkle,Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?
Twilight Sparkle,I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.
Spike,"Well... Maybe someone borrowed it? Besides, you don't need that book. You can already name all the planets and stars, 'cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer."
Spike,"Yeah, I'm a sweet talker."
Twilight Sparkle,"And a number one assistant, right?"
Spike,Check!
Rainbow Dash,"[munch] [gulp] Wow, Twilight! You're lucky to have such a rad assistant. I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them."
Scootaloo,"Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me! I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash?"
Scootaloo,Yes ma'am!
Rarity,Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing?
Spike,"Oh, come on. [pause] I said come on."
Pinkie Pie,Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?
Rarity,"Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you."
Spike,"Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop it. [pause] Twilight, your turn."
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, that's enough."
Spike,"Oh, right. That's enough."
Sweetie Belle,"Hey, everypony! The show is starting!"
Twilight Sparkle and Spike,Wow...
Spike,[yawn] Huh?
Pinkie Pie,Mmm. Wow! These cookies are delish!
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? Spike?"
Rarity,"Oh, poor little thing."
Twilight Sparkle,Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.
Pinkie Pie,"And now the punch has been... ""spiked""!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Goodnight, Spike. [giggle] Sweet dreams, number one assistant. [sigh] ""The Study of Comets. Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of nonvolatile grains and frozen gases. They..."""
Twilight Sparkle,"Huh.<U+00A0>""...have body structures that are fragile and diverse..."""
Twilight Sparkle,Shoot! Oh... This is a job for Spike. If only he were awake...
Owlowiscious,Hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,Wait! Don't go! Don't be afraid. Thank you for returning my scroll.
Owlowiscious,Hoo! Hoo! Hoo-hoo.
Twilight Sparkle,"Gosh, it's cold tonight. Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work?"
Owlowiscious,Hoo! Hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,"Now, where was I? Oh, yes. ""...fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..."""
Spike,"[snoring] Huh? Waah! I overslept! I know it's already ten, but I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed and ready to work twice as fast! Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight! And what do you want for breakfast? Oatmeal? How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, don't worry."
Spike,But my morning chores...
Twilight Sparkle,It's okay. Owlowiscious did them for you.
Spike,Who?
Twilight Sparkle,He's our new junior assistant. He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.
Spike,"Wha... Wh... What do we need a junior assistant for? I'm not tired. I do fine on my own. I don't need sleep, I..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, don't worry. He's just here to help out a little. Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowiscious? He's in the library."
Spike,"Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried. Who's worried? Hello? Hellooo! Whoa! Dude, that's creepy. Uh... Hi there! I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me."
Owlowiscious,Hoo.
Spike,"Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?"
Owlowiscious,Hoo?
Spike,I'm Spike! And who are you? What are you?
Owlowiscious,Hoo!
Spike,Who?
Owlowiscious,Hoo!
Spike,I thought your name was Owlowiscious!
Owlowiscious,Hoo?
Spike,"Okay, ""Who"", ""Owlowiscious"", whatever. I'm Spike, okay? Look! All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two. Got it?"
Owlowiscious,Hoo?
Spike,"So, a man of mystery, huh? I'm keeping my eye on you! I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know? [crash] Well, not really, but... You know what I mean!"
Spike,That bird is out for my job. He wants to be number one. I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one. Not Freaky Feathers over there. I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, what a fantastical, flufflicious feathery little friend! I'm... Hooked!"
Fluttershy,He's just wonderful.
Spike,"[mocking] ""He's just wonderful."" Uh, yes. Wonderful. He's quite... the charmer."
Rarity,And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.
Spike,Grrr!
Applejack,What's he all saddle sore about?
Rainbow Dash,He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious.
Fluttershy,Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?
Twilight Sparkle,Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced.
Spike,They're trying to replace me! I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called ""Two-headed Myth<U+0097>"
Spike,"...Mythological Mysteries!"" I know where it is."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks, Owlowiscious. Hey, Spike, no worries. Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. Oh, and gee! I guess I need ""Ferrets of Fairyland"" too."
Spike,Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,Climb down from there before you fall.
Spike,Grrr!
Twilight Sparkle,Shoot!
Spike,"Yes, sir!"
Twilight Sparkle,My last writing quill. It's broken.
Spike,"Never fear! Spike, your number one assistant, is here! [under his breath] Quill... Quill... Where is it? Not here... Quill... Quill, where is it...?"
Owlowiscious,Hoo.
Spike,Where am I gonna get a quill?
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, wait! Wait!"
Spike,"But the store is called ""Quills and Sofas"". You only sell two things!"
Davenport,"Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday. Need a sofa?"
Pinkie Pie,"I swore I had one here somewhere. Ah, here it is! A quince!"
Spike,Not a quince. A quill!
Spike,Not a quiche. [pronounced correctly] A quill!
Pinkie Pie,Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.
Spike,[sigh] Shoot.
Spike,"Come on, chicken! Here, chicky-chicky-chicky! Here, chick-chick-chick-chicky! Come here! Ugh! Come here! [grunting] Not the face, not the face! No! Hey! Stop! Quit it!"
Spike,[panting] Spike... to the rescue.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. Owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill."
Spike,"That's just great. Perfect! Sweet! I think I'll just, uh... finish up the rest of my chores! Or did Owlowiscious already do them?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them."
Twilight Sparkle,Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy.
Spike,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike. What is this? You said this book was missing. Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. How did it get this way?"
Spike,"Uh... Well, um... You see, I... I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh... Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike."
Spike,"[to Owlowiscious] You set me up! Well, two can play that game."
Owlowiscious,Hoo!
Spike,"Not ""who""! Two! Urgh!"
Spike,"Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it! I've gotta stop him. But how?"
Spike,Ah... Muahahaha!
Rarity,"Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party."
Spike,"So lifelike. And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to blame. And I'll be number one... again! Muhahaha!"
Spike,"[evil laugh]<U+00A0>That poor little field mouse! Torn to pieces! It must have been Owlowiscious! You know, since owls eat, you know, mice. What a terrible, terrible bird! He must be punished! Right?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike! I don't know what upsets me more. That you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. This is not the Spike I know and love."
Spike,She... She doesn't love me anymore.
Spike,"Twilight hates me. I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely. Could it get any worse?"
Spike,I guess that's a yes.<U+00A0>Hello? Hello?
Spike,"What is that?<U+00A0>If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home! Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!"
Spike,"[hiccup] Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me is still empty. I miss Twilight and the pony gang. But she doesn't love me anymore. So, I'm better off here, all by myself. Wow. Seems to be getting warmer. The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure getting hot in here."
Green dragon,What are you doing in my cave? And why are you eating my gems?
Spike,"Heyah bro! I didn't know this was your cave. And I didn't know these were your gems, but... we're cool, right?"
Spike,"Whoa, whoa! Hey... We're like brothers, you know? I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon... It's us against the world, right?"
Spike,You don't scare me! So you're big.
Spike,"Really big. And your claws are super sharp. Tail... extra spiky. But, uh... You don't scare me! Ha! How'd you like that? Uh... I'd love to stay, but gotta go! See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya! Aah!"
Owlowiscious,Hoo-hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Over here!
Spike,Am I glad to see you!
Twilight Sparkle,Hurry! Hop on! It's too dark! I can't see!
Owlowiscious,Hoo! Hoo-hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,[pants] Spike. We were so worried about you. I was so worried about you. Why did you run away?
Spike,I thought you didn't need me anymore. And that you didn't love me anymore.
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! And friend. And you always will be. It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to stay up late. You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owlowiscious to help. But not to take your place. No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull."
Spike,"I'm sorry, Twilight. I never should have been so jealous."
Twilight Sparkle,"And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive."
Spike,And Owlowiscious... I know now that you weren't out to take my job. Forgive me?
Owlowiscious,Hoo?
Spike,"Me. Forgive me, Spike."
Owlowiscious,Hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,"[giggle] He forgives you, Spike."
Spike,Hey! How did you guys know where I was?
Twilight Sparkle,It was your ketchup-covered feet. Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.
Twilight Sparkle,I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today...
Spike,I'm ready when you are.
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Spike. Why don't you write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what you've learned?"
Spike,"Really? Why, that's a big responsibility!"
Twilight Sparkle,I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
Spike,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike."
Owlowiscious,Hoo?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh! Hi, Pinkie Pie..."
Pinkie Pie,This is your singing telegram I hope it finds you well You're invited to a party 'Cause we think you're really swell
Others,Gummy's turning one year old So help us celebrate The cake will be delicious The festivities first-rate
Others,"There will be games and dancing Bob for apples, cut a rug [pop] And when the party's over We'll gather 'round for a group hug"
Slowing down,No need to bring a gift Being there will be enough Birthdays mean having fun with friends Not getting lots of stuff
Breathing heavily,"It won't be the same without you So we hope that you say yes So, please, oh please R.S.V.P. And come, and be our guest!"
Pinkie Pie,"[rasping voice] Next time, I think I'll just pass out written invitations."
Rainbow Dash,"Nice one! Now, let me show you how it's really done."
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, girls!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Pinkie Pie!"
Applejack,Howdy!
Pinkie Pie,[squeal] Just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you could make it to Gummy's party.
Applejack,Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Rainbow Dash,"Me neither. When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there! Ta-da!"
Pinkie Pie,"Aw! It's just a boring old apple. Don't worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there."
Rainbow Dash,[spits] What kind of surprises?
Pinkie Pie,"I can't tell you that, silly. Then it wouldn't be a surprise."
Rarity,"This punch is simply divine. Is this the same recipe you used for your ""Spring Has Sprung"" party?"
Pinkie Pie,Nope! Something new.
Pinkie Pie,It's Gummy's favorite.
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, this is my jam!"
Pinkie Pie,Having fun?
Twilight Sparkle,A blast!
Fluttershy,"You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,They're always the best parties 'cause my best friends are always there!
Twilight Sparkle,Yah!
Pinkie Pie,"C'mon, everypony! Gummy wants to dance! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday!"
Applejack,"Hoo-wee! I am beat! I haven't danced that much since... Well, since your last party. Thanks again for the invite!"
Rainbow Dash,"See ya later, birthday alligator!"
Rarity,Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soiree.
Fluttershy,It's been lovely.
Pinkie Pie,You sure you don't wanna stay? There's still some cake left.
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, I think I'm gonna pass. Great party though. We should do this again soon."
Pinkie Pie,[gasp] We should do this again soon!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh! Hi, Pinki-"
Pinkie Pie,It's soon!
Twilight Sparkle,Pardon me?
Pinkie Pie,"You said we should have another party soon, and... it's soon! Here's your invitation!"
Twilight Sparkle,"""You're invited to Gummy's 'after-birthday' party. This afternoon at 3 o'clock."""
Pinkie Pie,"All our bestest friends are invited, and there's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!"
Twilight Sparkle,"This afternoon? As in, ""this afternoon"" this afternoon?"
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, indeedy!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, gosh. I wish I could make it, but I've gotten a bit behind in my studies. I've really gotta hit the books."
Pinkie Pie,"I understand. Your studies come first. But don't worry, we'll be sure to save you some cake."
Twilight Sparkle,Please do.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books. You should really just read them."
Twilight Sparkle,I'll keep that in mind.
Applejack,"Huh? Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie! What brings you 'round these parts?"
Pinkie Pie,"Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?! It's an invitation to Gummy's ""after-birthday"" party this afternoon. There's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!"
Applejack,"This afternoon? A-as in, ""this afternoon"" this afternoon?"
Pinkie Pie,"That's funny. That's just what Twilight said, and the answer is, ""Yes! It's this afternoon!"""
Applejack,"Uh, well, I... I... uh... I don't think I can make it 'cause... uh... I have to... uh... uh, you know what? I... uh... pick apples! Yep, apples! 'Cause that's what we do! With the... apples. We, uh... pick 'em!"
Pinkie Pie,"Okey-dokey-lokey! A party is still a party, even if there are only three guests."
Spike,"[grunts] Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one?"
Rarity,[sniff] [whimper] Hmm... perhaps you could take a bath. How do I put this delicately? You smell like a rotten apple core that's been wrapped in moldy hay and dipped in dragon perspiration.
Rarity,Ooh! Love the new hat. Very modern. What's the occasion?
Pinkie Pie,"Gummy's ""after-birthday"" party is this afternoon. I'm delivering the invitations."
Rarity,"The party is this afternoon? As in, ""this afternoon"" this afternoon?"
Pinkie Pie,It's so strange. Everypony keeps saying that.
Rarity,Oh... do they?
Pinkie Pie,"I know it's short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party."
Rarity,"And I'm sure that we would, but I'm going to have to decline. I have to... wash my hair!"
Pinkie Pie,"Don't be silly, your hair doesn't look dirty."
Rarity,It doesn't?
Pinkie Pie,Nope!
Rarity,See? [gag] Dirty! I have to go!
Pinkie Pie,"Huh... No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity. Oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests."
Rainbow Dash,This afternoon?
Fluttershy,As in...?
Pinkie Pie,"Yes! As in, ""this afternoon"" this afternoon!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, man! We'd love to, but... we're... house-sitting this afternoon."
Pinkie Pie,[sigh] Both of you?
Fluttershy,It's... uh... a big house.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, look at the time! We'd really better get going."
Pinkie Pie,Wait! Maybe I could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream. Who're you house-sitting for?
Rainbow Dash,Harry.
Pinkie Pie,Harry?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I don't think you know him."
Pinkie Pie,That's strange. I know just about everypony around here.
Fluttershy,He's... a bear.
Pinkie Pie,A bear?
Rainbow Dash,"Yup! He's a bear all right, and he'll be pretty upset if we don't get over to his house soon."
Pinkie Pie,Wait! There's a bear around here who lives in a house?
Fluttershy,"It's, uh, really more of a cave."
Rainbow Dash,"But he's fixed up the place so much, it feels like a house."
Fluttershy,"And, uh, he wants us to look after his house... uh, cave... while he's, uh..."
Rainbow Dash,A-at the beach!
Pinkie Pie,He's vacationing at the beach?
Rainbow Dash,Yup! He loves to...
Rainbow Dash,Gotta go!
Pinkie Pie,"Something strange is definitely going on around here, Gummy. Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too? Rarity has to wash her hair? Applejack has to pick apples? Twilight is behind on her studies and has to hit the books? The more I think about it, the more those are starting to sound like... [gasp] excuses!"
Pinkie Pie,That doesn't look like studying... or hitting!
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. Ooh! You must be here for...
Twilight Sparkle,Shh! Is Pinkie Pie around?
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, I don't think so."
Twilight Sparkle,Good. I don't wanna her to know anything about this.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Yes, of course. I'll be right back."
Pinkie Pie,But... we're friends. What wouldn't Twilight want me to know anything about? [gasp] She's coming back.
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. There you go.
Pinkie Pie,Time to get to the bottom of things! [gasp] I think our cover's been blown! We'll need a new disguise.
Rarity,"She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't think so.
Rarity,"Oh, good. I'd hate for her to ruin everything."
Twilight Sparkle,Me too.
Rarity,Have you seen her?
Fluttershy,Not since this morning.
Rarity,Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today?
Fluttershy,I'm just glad I was able to come up with an excuse for why I couldn't be there.
Rarity,Me too! This is obviously going to be so much better.
Fluttershy,"As long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will."
Rarity,[whispering] See you later!
Pinkie Pie,I thought everypony loved my parties.
Rainbow Dash,"Hi, Pinkie Pie! Uh-oh!"
Pinkie Pie,Rainbow Dash! Wait!
Rainbow Dash,Phew...
Pinkie Pie,Where're you going?!
Rainbow Dash,Ah!
Pinkie Pie,What's the real reason you didn't want to come to Gummy's party?!
Pinkie Pie,What's in those bags?!
Rainbow Dash,Applejack! We have a problem!
Pinkie Pie,I know you're IN THERE!
Applejack,"Oh! Howdy, pardner!"
Pinkie Pie,Mind if I... take a look inside the barn?
Applejack,"No! Uh, I mean, yes, I mean... you can't come in here!"
Pinkie Pie,Rainbow Dash just went in there.
Applejack,"Oh, well, she was just bringin' in some... supplies! Yup, supplies for the... renovation! Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom... uh, lots of construction goin' on in there right now."
Rainbow Dash,[whispering] You heard her! Construction!
Pinkie Pie,Okey... dokey... lokey.
Pinkie Pie,"Secrets and lies! It's all secrets and lies with those ponies! They're up to something, Gummy! Something they don't want me to know about! Well, I'm gonna know about it! I'm gonna know about it big time! And I know just who's gonna tell me all about it. Tell me all about it big time!"
Spike,Wow! Nice spread!
Pinkie Pie,"It's all yours, Spike. All you have to do is talk."
Spike,"That's it? Oh, you got it. Okay... uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh? I love a sunny spring day, don't you? The birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'."
Pinkie Pie,"No, no, no. Talk about our friends."
Spike,"Oh, okay. Let's see, there's Twilight Sparkle. She's a unicorn. Good with magic. A real brainiac. And then you got Rarity. Total knockout. Twilight seems to think I don't even have a chance with her, but... eh, what does she know? Let's see. There's... there's Fluttershy, a Pegasus who's afraid of heights. Heh, what's up with that?"
Pinkie Pie,Grr! No! You're not understanding me! I want you to confess!
Spike,Confess?
Pinkie Pie,Confess!
Spike,"I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's copy of ""Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions""!"
Pinkie Pie,And?
Spike,And I'm the one who used up all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday when I took a seven-hour bubble bath!
Pinkie Pie,Aaand?
Spike,"And sometimes... when no one's around... I do this: Lookin' good, Spike! Lookin' real good!"
Pinkie Pie,No! No! No! No!
Spike,"W-What do you wanna hear? Tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it!"
Spike,Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you 'cause they don't like your parties and they don't want to be your friends anymore!
Pinkie Pie,"Aha! I knew it! [balloon deflating noise] Oh no, my friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore."
Pinkie Pie,Thank you all so much for coming! It means so much to Gummy.
Pinkie Pie voicing a bucket of turnips,Could I have some more punch?
Pinkie Pie voicing a pile of rocks,This is one great pahty! You really outdone yourself!
Pinkie Pie,"Why, thank you, Rocky."
Pinkie Pie voicing a clump of lint,I'm having a delightful time as well.
Pinkie Pie voicing a bag of flour,Might I trouble you for anozer slice of cake?
Pinkie Pie,"Anything for you, Madame le Flour."
Others,Pinkie Pie [as Rocky]: I'm just glad none o' them ponies showed up.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, they're not so bad."
Rocky,Not so bad? Puh-lease! They're a buncha losers!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, c'mon now. ""Losers"" might be a little strong, dont'cha think?"
Sir Lintsalot,"After the way they treated you? I say ""losers"" isn't strong enough."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, it was pretty rude..."
Madame le Flour,Pretty rude? It was downright deespicable!
Pinkie Pie,"It was, wasn't it?"
Mr. Turnip,"Mr. If I were you, I wouldn't speak to them ever again."
Pinkie Pie,You know what? I'm not gonna speak to them ever again. And I'm not gonna invite them to another party as long as I live! They don't deserve to be invited to my parties. [plink] Not after the way they've been acting.
Madame le Flour,[clapping] Deeespicable!
Sir Lintsalot,Such losers!
Madame le Flour,"Yes, zat's right."
Others,Pinkie Pie [as Mr. Turnip]: Well done.
Others,Pinkie Pie [as Sir Lintsalot]: Yeah!
Others,Pinkie Pie [as Rocky]: You show 'em!
Pinkie Pie,Who could that be?
Rainbow Dash,"Hey there, Pinkie Pie! Sorry I was in such a rush earlier. Had some place to be and couldn't slow down and say, ""Hello."" You know how it goes."
Pinkie Pie,"I know how it goes, all right!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah... so, why don't you come with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?"
Pinkie Pie,"No thanks. I'm spending time with my real friends. Isn't that right, Madame le Flour?"
Others,"Pinkie Pie [as Madame le Flour]: Oui! Zat iz correct, madame."
Rainbow Dash,Uh... Pinkie Pie?
Pinkie Pie,"Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?"
Others,Pinkie Pie [as Sir Lintsalot]: I'd love one.
Rainbow Dash,Aaallrighty. What do you say we get on out of Creepytown and head over to Applejack's...
Others,Pinkie Pie [as Mr. Turnip]: She's not going anywhere.
Pinkie Pie,I most certainly am not. I'm having a wonderful time right here.
Rainbow Dash,You should really just come with me.
Others,"Pinkie Pie [as Rocky]: You heard the lady! She ain't goin' nowheres, chump!"
Rainbow Dash,"Who you calling a chump, chump?! Ugh... That's it. Party's over. Come on, Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie,No!
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie, let's go!"
Pinkie Pie,I said no!
Rainbow Dash,You... [grunts] have to... come with... me!
Pinkie Pie,No... I... Don't!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, you wanna do this the hard way?! We'll do this the hard way!"
Rainbow Dash,[grunting] [panting] We're... here...
Others,"Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Rarity, [in unison] Surprise!"
Fluttershy,I really thought she'd be more excited.
Pinkie Pie,Excited? Excited?! Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?!
Twilight Sparkle,Farewell party?
Pinkie Pie,"Yes! You don't like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate! A ""Farewell to Pinkie Pie"" party!"
Applejack,"Why in the world would you think we didn't like you anymore, sugarcube?"
Pinkie Pie,"Why? Why? Why?! Because you've been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that's why!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, yeah! Because we wanted your party to be a surprise."
Rarity,"We'd been planning this party for such a long time, we had to make excuses for why we couldn't attend Gummy's party so that we could get everything ready for yours."
Twilight Sparkle,"If this is a farewell party, why does the cake I picked up from Sugarcube Corner say ""Happy Birthday, Pinkie Pie""?"
Pinkie Pie,"[squeak] Because it's my birthday! Ooh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday?"
Pinkie Pie,And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!
Rarity,"That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling."
Pinkie Pie,You girls are the best friends ever! How could I have ever doubted you?
Twilight Sparkle,"It's okay, Pinkie Pie. It could have happened to any of us."
Rainbow Dash,Uh-huh! It sure would.
Fluttershy,Don't worry about it.
Rainbow Dash,I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips.
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Rainbow Dash,You don't wanna know.
Applejack,"All right, girls! Enough of this gab. Let's party!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"I am writing to you from the most delightful party. I'm not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart."
Others,"Your faithful student,"
Others,Twilight Sparkle
Pinkie Pie,"You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's after-birthday party too, would you? His party was cut short, and he's pretty upset about it."
Fluttershy,"Oh, definitely."
Rarity,"Aww, he was upset?"
Applejack,"Uh-huh, sure!"
Rainbow Dash,"For Gummy, yeah!"
Pinkie Pie,Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie! Please stop shouting, I'm trying to concentrate."
Rarity,"Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala, and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty."
Pinkie Pie,What's Twilight doing?
Spike,She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala.
Rarity,Where are the others? It's getting late.
Applejack,"Hold your horses, girl. We're here."
Twilight Sparkle,Perfect! I'm ready.
Rainbow Dash,For what?
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, Spike."
Pinkie Pie,An apple! Are we having pie?
Spike,Shh! Watch!
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks. But that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?"
Fluttershy,"Yes. Will they be safe, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,You have my word.
Twilight Sparkle,Ta-da!
Twilight Sparkle,"Neat, huh? And don't worry. They'll be mice again at midnight."
Fluttershy,"Opalescence, no!"
Twilight Sparkle,Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?
Rarity,Whatever shall we do?
Rarity,"Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala?"
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. Yeah. Right.
Pinkie Pie,Ooh!
Spike,"Come on, you guys. Let me in!"
Rainbow Dash,"Sure thing, Spike."
Rarity,Heavens no! We're getting dressed.
Applejack,"Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes."
Rarity,"[moan] I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards."
Spike,"I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our hometown, Twilight! And the best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh... I-I don't know, Spike."
Rarity,We'll just have to see.
Applejack,We're gonna be a mite busy.
Spike,Oh. Okay.
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together."
Spike,Great!
Spike,"'Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot. I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels, and Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree. And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop."
Spike,Then let's get moving! Hyah!
Caramel,Excuse me!?
Spike,Um... I...
Lucky Clover,If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity... Hmph.
Spike,Whoa! You all look... amazing!
Twilight Sparkle,"I can't believe we're finally here. With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this... The Best Night Ever!"

Princess Celestia,Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I'm so excited to be here! We have so much to catch up on."
Princess Celestia,"Well, I want you right by my side the entire evening, so we'll have plenty of time together."
Twilight Sparkle,That's just what I was hoping you'd say.
Rarity,"[gasp] [squeals of excitement] Hurry, Rarity... Oh, but not too fast. But don't wanna lose him... Wait! Have to play it cool. Oh, but don't be cold! I can't lose him, I can't! He's everything I imagined! Even better than I imagined."
Fluttershy,Oh my! A meadowlark!
Applejack,"Howdy, partner! You hungry?"
Soarin,As a horse!
Applejack,"Well, what'cha hankering for? Caramel apple? Apple pie? Apple fritter? Apple fries?"
Soarin,I'll take that big apple pie!
Applejack,"Well, thank you kindly, sir! Yee-haw! In the first minute, I made my first sale. Just like I expected."
Spitfire,"Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soarin?"
Soarin,Heh. Yeah! [gasp] My pie! You saved it. Thanks.
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, no prob."
Spitfire,Hey! I know you. You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale and won The Best Flyer Competition.
Rainbow Dash,Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.
Spitfire,"Well, Rainbow Dash. Looks like your skills saved us again. Oh, well, at least they saved Soarin's apple pie."
Soarin,[eating noisily] Yeah...
Spitfire,Wanna come hang out with us?
Pinkie Pie,"The shiny dance floor... The pretty party ponies... Ooh, the fancy band... Shiny! Pretty! Fancy! [anxious noise] Gotta dance!"
Pinkie Pie,"I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala, I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala, I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala, It's all I ever dreamed."
Others,It's all I've ever... dreamed?
Prince Blueblood,"Well, hello. I am Prince Blueblood."
Rarity,"I am... Rarity. Oh my, what a lovely rose."
Prince Blueblood,You mean... this rose? Thank you. It goes with my eyes.
Fluttershy,[gasp] My little meadowlark is right around this bend!
Fluttershy,Was that you?
Fluttershy,Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.
Fluttershy,"Oh! I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey! And, oh! Is that a wallaroo? Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Spitfire! You ever done a rain cloud double backflip? [to Soarin] You ever soared past lightning? It's awesome!"
Princess Celestia,Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.
Twilight Sparkle,Princess! I've been so excited to spend time with you and...
Princess Celestia,"Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh, good evening! Welcome to the Gala. Which is why I... Ladies! Lovely to see you again."
Twilight Sparkle,[sigh] Looks like getting a chance to talk to the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.
Applejack,"First minute, first sale. Second... Fourth... Sixth... Sixtieth minute... no sales. [sigh] This ain't what I expected at all."
Pinkie Pie,I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed.
Rarity,This isn't at all what I imagined.
Princess Celestia,[in background] Good evening! So nice to see you. Welcome!
Twilight Sparkle,This isn't what I hoped.
Rainbow Dash,This isn't hanging out.
Fluttershy,This isn't what I wished for.
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Rarity,I waited all my life...
Fluttershy,...for this moment!
Pinkie Pie,And I'm not going to...
Applejack,...let it slip by!
Rainbow Dash,If it's the last thing I do...
Twilight Sparkle,...I'm gonna make this...
All,...the best night ever!
Fluttershy,"I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says. [loudly] I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends! But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!"
Fluttershy,Gotcha! It's okay. I promise not to hurt you. I just wanna be your... friend?
Mr. Greenhooves,Mr. Mmm... Sounds good to me.
Rarity,"Just give him a chance, Rarity. His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient."
Prince Blueblood,Miss Rarity! Stop!
Rarity,Oh. Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.
Prince Blueblood,One would hate to slip.
Rarity,Yes. One certainly would.
Prince Blueblood,One's cloak should take care of the problem.
Rarity,"Oh, of course it will."
Pinkie Pie,"[gasp] [whispering] C'mon, everypony! I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!"
Pinkie Pie,You reach your right hoof in You reach your right hoof out You reach your right hoof in And you shake it all about You do the Pony Pokey meeting lots of folks with clout That's what I'm talking about
Others,You step your left hoof in You pull it right back out You step your left hoof in But you better help him out You do the Pony Pokey but should find a different route That's what it's all about
Others,You kick your back left in You pull your back left out You reach your back left in Just be brave and have no doubt You do the Pony Pokey feeling like you're gonna pout That's what I'm singing about
Others,You tilt your head in You tilt your head out You tilt your head in Then you shake it all about You do the Pony Pokey even though your date's a lout You're better off without
Others,You stomp your whole self in You stomp your whole self out You stomp your whole self in And you stomp yourself about You do the Pony Pokey and you give a little shout-
Fluttershy,COME OUT!
Pinkie Pie,That's what I'm talking about
Others,You do the Pony Pokey You do the Pony Pokey You do the Pony Pokey And that's what it's all about
Others,Yeah!
Lyrica Lilac,"Young lady, this is not that kind of party."
Pinkie Pie,Ohhhhhh... They don't want a party. These ponies want a paaartay!
Rarity,"Two apple fritters, please."
Applejack,Two apple fritters comin' right up. That'll be four bits.
Rarity,Ahem.
Prince Blueblood,Ahem.
Rarity,Ahem!
Prince Blueblood,Ahem!
Rarity,"[sigh] I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?"
Applejack,"It's okay, Rarity. I got you covered."
Rarity,"Thank you, Applejack. At least somepony here has good manners."
Prince Blueblood,[barf] Oh! Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples! My royal lips have touched common carnival fare! I'm going to the buffet for some... hors d'oeuvres.
Applejack,"Well, no wonder nopony wants my food. They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles. Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em."
Fluttershy,"I'll catch you yet, my pretties. Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net... you'll be mine! Mine! [evil laugh] Whoa!"
Pinkie Pie,"Come on, everypony! You wanted a partay? Now it's paaartaaay! Yeah! Uh! Now that's a beat, yeah! Uh! C'mon, dance! Yeah, woohoo!"
Applejack,"Okay, all you high-class ponies. Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds."
Pinkie Pie,Stage dive!
Rarity,"[angry growl] You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met! In fact, the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain!"
Prince Blueblood,"Ewww...! Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!"
Rainbow Dash,This is my chance! Yes! Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,Well... it can't get any worse.
Fluttershy,You're... going to love me!
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, um, uh... Eugh."
Princess Celestia,Run.
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper! Now your prince is sure to find you."
Rarity,[shriek] No! Ugh! Let's go!
Spike,"Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut."
Joe,Don't you think you've had enough?
Spike,Another donut! Extra sprinkles!
Joe,"Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha. Long time no see."
Spike,"Hey, how was the Gala? How was your best night ever?"
Spike,That sounds like the worst night ever!
Twilight Sparkle,I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset with us for ruining the Gala.
Princess Celestia,That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!
Everypony,Princess Celestia!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful."
Princess Celestia,"Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful."
Twilight Sparkle,It is?
Princess Celestia,"That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends."
Twilight Sparkle,"You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great."
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
Fluttershy,Talking!
Pinkie Pie,Laughing!
Spike,You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, Spike. You were right."
Applejack,As horrible as our night was...
Rarity,...being together here has made it all better.
Pinkie Pie,"In fact, it's made it..."
All sans Celestia,...the best night ever!
Cheerilee,"I want to start our field trip here, in the world-famous Canterlot sculpture garden. That one over there represents ""Friendship"". All right, my little ponies, this one represents ""Victory""."
Scootaloo,How cool would it be to have that for a cutie mark?
Apple Bloom,"Cool, if you were actually victoryful at somethin'."
Sweetie Belle,That's not a word!
Scootaloo,"What are you, a dictionary?"
Cheerilee,Girls! Now this is a really interesting statue. What do you notice about it?
Apple Bloom,It's got an eagle claw!
Scootaloo,And a lion paw!
Sweetie Belle,And a snake tail!
Cheerilee,This creature is called a draconequus. He has the head of a pony and a body made up of all sorts of things. What do you suppose that represents?
Apple Bloom,Confusion!
Sweetie Belle,Evil!
Scootaloo,Chaos!
Sweetie Belle,"It's not chaos, you dodo!"
Scootaloo,Don't call me things I don't know the meaning of! And it is too chaos!
Sweetie Belle,Is not!
Apple Bloom,You're both wrong!
Cheerilee,"Actually, in a way, you're all right. This statue represents ""Discord"", which means a lack of harmony between ponies. In fact, you three have demonstrated discord so well that you're each going to write me an essay explaining it."
Cheerilee,"Now let's go, and I don't want anymore fighting."
Apple Bloom,It's confusion!
Sweetie Belle,Evil!
Scootaloo,Chaos!
Rainbow Dash,"Come back here, you! Gotcha! Eww, what is this? Cotton candy?"
Rainbow Dash,Wait a second! It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow. You can't just<U+0096>
Rainbow Dash,You did.
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, I didn't tell you to go anywhere!"
Applejack,"Rainbow Dash, what's going on with this rain? I mean chocolate milk? I mean chocolate milk rain?!"
Rainbow Dash,There's crazy weather all over Equestria! Cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now! But don't worry. I'm not leaving you until I get control of Ponyville!
Rarity,"Ahem. I heard about your troubles, Applejack, and I came to see if there's anything I can do without getting wet. Or dirty. Or out from under my umbrella."
Applejack,Fluttershy! Do somethin'!
Fluttershy,"Now, Angel, you really shouldn't<U+0096> No! It's not possible! I must be seeing things!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, everyone. I've learned a new spell that'll fix everything. My fail-safe spell... failed. What do we do?"
Spike,"Uh, give up?"
Rarity,"Spike, Twilight will come up with something."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hmm, time for plan B. Rainbow, can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky? Applejack, I need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to Earth."
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, what happened?"
Fluttershy,Oh dear. I hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds. I'd hate to have to share them.
Pinkie Pie,"You and me both, sister! Hey!"
Applejack,"And when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert."
Twilight Sparkle,"You see, Spike? You should never give up. There's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together."
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasp] Come on, girls. Princess Celestia wants to see us all in Canterlot immediately!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could!"
Princess Celestia,"Thank you, Twilight. Thank you, all."
Twilight Sparkle,Is this about the weather? And the animals' weird behavior? What's happening out there? Why isn't my magic working? Is there<U+0096>
Princess Celestia,Follow me.
Princess Celestia,"I've called you here for a matter of great importance. It seems an old foe of mine, someone I thought I had defeated long ago, has returned. His name... is Discord."
Princess Celestia,"Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns alike, so after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our powers and rose up against him, turning him to stone."
Rainbow Dash,"All right, Princess!"
Princess Celestia,"I thought the spell we cast would keep him contained forever, but since Luna and I are no longer connected to the Elements, the spell has been broken."
Twilight Sparkle,No longer connected?
Princess Celestia,"This is Canterlot Tower, where the Elements are kept inside since all of you recovered them. I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord before he thrusts all of Equestria into eternal chaos."
Twilight Sparkle,But why us? Why don't you<U+0096>
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, look! We're famous!"
Princess Celestia,"You six showed the full potential of the Elements by harnessing the magic of your friendship to beat a mighty foe. Although Luna and I once wielded the Elements, it is you who now control their power, and it is you who must defeat Discord!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia, you can count on<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. Chocolate rain!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't listen to her, Princess. We'd be honored to use the Elements of Harmony again."
Rarity,Ooh. You can keep the Elements. I'll take that case!
Princess Celestia,"Have no fear, ponies. I have total confidence that you will be able to defeat Discord with these!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, well. If anyone needs me, I'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw."
Twilight Sparkle,The Elements! They're gone!
Princess Celestia,That chamber is protected by a powerful spell that only I can break! This doesn't make sense!
Discord,"[laughter] Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?"
Princess Celestia,Discord... Show yourself!
Discord,"[chuckling] Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone."
Princess Celestia,Enough! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?
Princess Celestia,"You'll never get away with this, Discord!"
Discord,"Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring."
Rainbow Dash,Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!
Discord,"Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent."
Rainbow Dash,That's right! I'll always be loyal to the Princess!
Discord,We'll see about that.
Rarity,I can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window.
Discord,"The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?"
Applejack,"So you know who we are, big deal."
Discord,"Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle,You seem to know our strengths too.
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie,[laughing] He's standing on your head!
Princess Celestia,"Stop stalling, Discord! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?"
Fluttershy,Can we go home now?
Applejack,What do you reckon he meant? Twists and turns and ending back where we started?
Twilight Sparkle,Twists and turns... twists and turns... twists and turns! That's it! I bet Discord hid the Elements in the palace labyrinth!
Princess Celestia,"Good luck, my little ponies. The fate of Equestria is in your hooves."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down."
Fluttershy,W-We have to go in there?
Rainbow Dash,Nope! Dopey Discord forgot about these babies! I'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the Elements in no time. My wings!
Twilight Sparkle and Rarity,Your horn! My horn! Ahhh!
Twilight Sparkle,Give us our wings and horns back!
Discord,"You'll get them back in good time. I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game: no flying, and no magic."
Rainbow Dash,The first rule?
Twilight Sparkle,"Never fear, girls. We have each other!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! Like Twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together!"
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, girls, let's do this!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Stay calm, girls! Everypony head to the middle as fast as you can, and we'll regroup there!"
Rainbow Dash,Moving out!
Rarity,See you in the center.
Applejack,Yee-haw!
Pinkie Pie,See you guys there!
Fluttershy,[gasping] What's that? Who's there? Girls!
Applejack,What in tarnation? Where am I?
Applejack,Who are y'all?
Red apples,The keepers of the grove of truth. You may ask us...
Others,Light- ...one question...
Green apples,"...past, future or present."
Red apples,But be warned...
Others,Light- ...that the truth...
Green apples,...may not always be pleasant.
Applejack,"All right then. I don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but I've got a really bad feelin' about this feller Discord. What's gonna come of this mission we're on?"
Red apples,For the answer you seek...
Others,"Light- ...go ahead, take a peek."
Pond Rainbow Dash,I hope I never see you again!
Pond Fluttershy,Me too!
Pond Pinkie Pie,Fine!
Pond Rarity,Fine!
Pond Twilight Sparkle,It's settled then.
Applejack,No! Our friendship? Over?!
Applejack,It can't be true. It just can't!
Applejack,That just can't be the truth.
Others,Light- When all the truth does...
Green apples,...is make your heart ache...
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack! Thank goodness! I thought I heard voices over here. Who were you talking to?
Applejack,I was talking to... uh... nopony! Nopony whatsoever!
Twilight Sparkle,What?
Applejack,"Nothing. Come on, uh, we best be going."
Twilight Sparkle,"Did Applejack just...? Come on, Twilight! Applejack wouldn't lie."
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, what gives?"
Discord,"What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh?"
Pinkie Pie,It's different. They're laughing at me.
Discord,It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.
Pinkie Pie,"My friends laugh with me, not at me."
Pinkie Pie,No! Stop it!
Pinkie Pie,Stop laughing at me!
Discord,"Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy."
Pinkie Pie,[gravelly] Happy? I don't think so.
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh you are, huh? Why? Need a good laugh?"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie? What do you suppose has her so upset? It's not like her.
Applejack,I didn't notice anything strange about Pinkie.
Twilight Sparkle,Weird. Better pick up the pace before the stress of this gets the better of all of us.
Rarity,"I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sport. Agh. Oh my..."
Discord,"[laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?"
Rarity,"Yes... I like very much... No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others. [grunt] Mine!"
Twilight Sparkle,Rarity! Are we glad to see... Why are you carrying a humongous boulder?
Fluttershy,"[teeth chatter] Okay, I can do this. I can... [scream] Oh, wait a minute... Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!"
Butterflies,"Fluttershy, looks like you've been left behind by your so-called friends, huh?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, no. I'm certain they're doing their best to find me."
Butterflies,"Well, it must be so upsetting to know how weak and helpless they think you are."
Fluttershy,Not at all. I am weak and helpless and I appreciate their understanding.
Butterflies,"Yes... Well, surely it burns you up... I mean, that they're always pointing out your flaws, right?"
Fluttershy,"Not really. In fact, I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be."
Discord,"Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!"
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy! I'm so glad to see a friendly face. This awful labyrinth is getting to everypony.
Applejack,Grrr...
Fluttershy,"Aw, boo-hoo-hoo! Why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right?"
Twilight Sparkle,Uh...
Fluttershy,"Oh, that's right, you can't. You don't have one."
Twilight Sparkle,What is happening to my friends?
Pinkie Pie,And what are you laughing at?
Applejack,Chocolate milk.
Rarity,"Little help here! Thanks, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,You're welcome<U+0096>
Rarity,But don't get any ideas about my gem! I know where you live.
Rainbow Dash,"I've got you now, element."
Discord,Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.
Rainbow Dash,Get off there and put 'em up! Come on! Let's go!
Discord,"Hey, I'm here to deliver a message."
Rainbow Dash,I've got a message for you too!
Discord,"Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make:<U+00A0>the right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you."
Rainbow Dash,Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me? No!
Discord,"That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice."
Twilight Sparkle,Must... find... Rainbow Dash. As a team... we're unstoppable. Rainbow Dash won't let us down.
Applejack,"Well, looky there. Rainbow Dash is flying away. She's abandonin' us."
Twilight Sparkle,Now I know that's a lie. [gasp] How can it be?
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could."
Princess Celestia,I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord.
Twilight Sparkle,The Elements! They're gone!
Discord,"[laughter] Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win."
Applejack,Our friendship...over?
Twilight Sparkle,Who are you talking to?
Applejack,Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.
Twilight Sparkle,What?
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
Pinkie Pie,Why? Need a good laugh?
Twilight Sparkle,What is happening to my friends?
Pinkie Pie,And what are you laughing at!?
Discord,"Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, quit it! You'd better think before you laugh at the Pink...ie Pie!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, yeah? Well ha, ha."
Pinkie Pie,Quit it!
Fluttershy,"No. Ha, ha."
Pinkie Pie,Quit it!
Fluttershy,No. Ha ha-ha ha ha.
Applejack,"Uh... Rarity? This here diamond of yours? Twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together."
Rarity,"HI-YAH! Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine! Ya! Ya! Ya!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Girls, why are you all acting like this?"
Pinkie Pie,Quit it! Stop it!
Twilight Sparkle,We need to stick together.
Fluttershy,"Ha, ha."
Discord,[laughter] It's just too entertaining.
Twilight Sparkle,"Stop it, Discord. You're not playing fair."
Discord,"I'm not playing fair? Perhaps we haven't met. I'm Discord, spirit of chaos and disharmony. Hello?"
Twilight Sparkle,How are we supposed to find the Elements of Harmony when you took away the labyrinth before we could get to the end?
Discord,"Oh, wait, did you...? [laughter] How funny! You thought the Elements were in the labyrinth?"
Flashback Discord,Twists and turns are my master plan. Then find the Elements back where you began.
Discord,I never said they were in the labyrinth.
Twilight Sparkle,But...but...
Discord,"Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle. [mockingly] Maybe the magic of friendship can help you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak."
Pinkie Pie,Chocolate milk? I hate chocolate milk!
Twilight Sparkle,"[grunt] Think, Twilight, think! ""Find the Elements back where you began."" Back where you began."
Rarity,Don't touch my gem!
Fluttershy,"I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha, ha."
Pinkie Pie,What 'chu laughin' at?
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh. I just want to go home... Wait a minute... Home! ""Back where you began!"" The Elements must be in... Ponyville! Come on, girls. I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant. If we get back to the library, I have a book that I just know can give us a clue. Ah!"
Fluttershy,"Good boy, Angel. Mama's so proud."
Applejack,"Wow, I can see so much better now. Whoa! I meant to do that."
Twilight Sparkle,Wah! Ahh! Whoa! Discord's turned our dirt roads into soap!
Discord,"Beautiful, isn't it? This is the new and improved Ponyville, and these are only my first of changes."
Pinkie Pie,"This may look like fun, but it's not."
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh.
Discord,Picture it. The chaos capital of the world.
Discord,"Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day. Or not."
Twilight Sparkle,"Ponyville, the chaos capital of the world? Not if I have anything to say about it."
Twilight Sparkle,"[sigh] Okay, we're here. Everyone please, please, please just go inside, please?"
Applejack,I absolutely refuse.
Fluttershy,With pleasure.
Pinkie Pie,I hate libraries!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pleeeease, we gotta hurry!"
Rarity,"Forget it, Twilight. I know what you're up to. The second I go in, you'll have your little minion Spike come and take Tom!"
Twilight Sparkle,Tom?
Rarity,"Well, it's not going to work."
Twilight Sparkle,"You're not going in without him, are you?"
Rarity,Mm-mm.
Twilight Sparkle,[grunting] Fine!
Spike,"Ah! Brrr! What did you do that for, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy,'Cause you just looked so peaceful.
Spike,I...uh...huh?
Rarity,"Careful, Twilight! You'll ruin his beautiful finish."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, for the love of..."
Spike,"Twilight, what's going on? Why does everybody look so...gray?"
Twilight Sparkle,Don't ask. I need you to help me find something.
Fluttershy,"Hey, Twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless?"
Spike,What's happened to everypony?
Applejack,"I guess you just bring out the worst in us, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh. No time to explain. We've got to find the reference guide to the Elements of Harmony before somepony does something she'll regret!
Spike,"The Elements of Harmony? Oh, I know exactly where that book is. Found it!"
Fluttershy,Hah!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, you'd better give me that book!"
Fluttershy,[sing-song voice] Keep away!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey! Applejack, give me that book!"
Applejack,I don't have any book.
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie! You guys! Stop it right now!
Spike,Ugh!
Rarity,Mine!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, do you even know what you just stole?"
Rarity,"No, but if you want it, I want it!"
Twilight Sparkle,[strained groan] GIVE ME THAT BOOK!
Twilight Sparkle,Where is she? Where's Rarity?
Applejack,Beats me.
Twilight Sparkle,Lies!
Twilight Sparkle,"Get back! All of you! This is my book, and I'm going to READ IT! [gasp] The Elements!"
Twilight Sparkle,The Elements! They were here all along!
Spike,This is great! Now you guys can defeat Discord and put everything back to normal!
Twilight Sparkle,"See, girls? We did it! We found the Elements of Harmony! Together!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You don't even care, do you?"
All,No!
Twilight Sparkle,"[sigh] I never thought it would happen. My friends... have turned into complete JERKS! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! And... big crown thingy! Come on, everypony, let's go!"
Spike,"But Twilight, aren't you missing somepony?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Nope. We've got the liar, the grump, the hoarder, and the brute. That just about covers it."
Spike,But what about Rainbow Dash?
Twilight Sparkle,"Congratulations, Spike, you're the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!"
Spike,[gasp] Me? B-b-but what if she finds out I've been impersonating her? [moan] That won't end well.
Twilight Sparkle,"Too bad, you're Rainbow Dash. Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't ever have to talk to each other again!"
All but Rarity,Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,"Move! Look out, here comes Tom!"
Discord,"Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony. How terrifying!"
Twilight Sparkle,Discord! I've figured out your lame riddle. You're in for it now!
Discord,"I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready."
Twilight Sparkle,"Formation, now!"
All,Eh.
Twilight Sparkle,"""Rainbow Dash"", get over here."
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, let's get this over with. What's going on?"
Applejack,Mine's workin'. There must be somethin' wrong with yours.
Pinkie Pie,I HATE the Elements of Harmony!
Fluttershy,Hmph! Garbage.
Rarity,MINE!
Spike,"Sorry, Twilight. I guess I'd better get back upstairs and clean up the library. Good luck with all this<U+0096> whoa!"
Pinkie Pie,It's your fault it didn't work.
Twilight Sparkle,Who are you talking to?
Pinkie Pie,Any of you! ALL OF YOU! I'm outta here!
Applejack,"I better go, too. I've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm."
Fluttershy,Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.
Twilight Sparkle,"FINE! Leave! See if I care! I don't need you guys either! With friends like you, who needs...enemies...?"
Discord,"[laughing] Oh, my stomach! Twilight, you've got to see what I just did."
Discord,"It's priceless! [laughing] Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've got to get into the spirit of things! After all, this is your new home."
Twilight Sparkle,Not anymore...
Twilight Sparkle,"Pack your things, Spike, we're leaving."
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't ask where we're going, 'cause I don't know yet. Just not here."
Spike,Can't...move. The princess...has been sending these...since I came back upstairs. [belch] Make it stop!
Twilight Sparkle,These are all the letters I've written to the princess since I've lived in Ponyville. But why would she send them back?
Twilight Sparkle,"""Real friends don't care what your cover is."""
Others,"""Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing."""
Others,"""And like the path cut through the orchard, there will always be a way through."""
Others,"""The best thing to do is stay true to yourself."""
Others,"""Everypony has a special magical connection with her friends. Maybe even before she's met them."""
Others,"Spike! Spike, it's all so clear! Can't you see? Discord's trying to distract us from what's important. He knows how powerful our friendships are, and he's trying to keep us from seeing it. Do you remember what I said the first day we arrived in Ponyville? I told you that the future of Equestria didn't rest on me making friends. But the opposite is true! The friendships I've made since I've been here are what saved Equestria from Nightmare Moon. And now they need to save it from Discord!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You're right, Spike. I've got to fight for my friendships. For them. For me. For Equestria!"
Twilight Sparkle,Oh...uh...why don't you just stay here and rest? I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself.
Applejack,"And so I tried to defeat Discord, but none of my so-called ""friends"" would lift a hoof to help me."
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, I'm here to fight for our friendship."
Applejack,"Oh, now you want to fight. Where you went when I was battlin' Discord?"
Twilight Sparkle,Snap out of it. This isn't you! You're not a liar.
Applejack,"Wh-what happened? Twilight! [sigh] I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'. I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies. Can you ever forgive me?"
Twilight Sparkle,I already have. Come on!
Fluttershy,"Oh no! Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream!"
Rarity,What do you think you're doing? Get away from my gem! Get away--! [grunting] Let us never speak of this again.
Pinkie Pie,[laughter] And I-I turned gray! [giggle] Can you believe it?!
Fluttershy,Uh? She's not here.
Twilight Sparkle,"Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements."
Applejack,She could be anywhere by now! We're never gonna find her.
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!"
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, guys!"
Twilight Sparkle,We've been looking everywhere for you!
Rainbow Dash,That's nice.
Twilight Sparkle,"Discord's still on the loose! We need you to help us defeat him with your element, Loyalty!"
Rainbow Dash,"Pfft. Loyalty, schmoyalty! Have you guys seen Ponyville? It's a disaster! I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome."
Rarity,How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?
Applejack,The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.
Rarity,I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.
Twilight Sparkle,Time for Plan B.
Twilight Sparkle,"[whispering] Okay, Fluttershy, you grab Rainbow Dash and hold her down. Applejack will lower me down from this rope so I can cast the memory spell on her."
Fluttershy,Got it!
Fluttershy,Um...I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh...
Rainbow Dash,"Nice try! Ponyville's your problem, not mine."
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, Fluttershy, we've got to catch her. Hyah! Applejack!"
Rarity and Pinkie Pie,WHOA!
Rarity,PINKIE! You were supposed to secure the ROPE!
Pinkie Pie,Oops.
Applejack,"Rarity, Pinkie, hold on! Y'all are slowing her down!"
Rarity,"Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?"
Fluttershy,[whimper/crying] I can't!
Twilight Sparkle,"If you can't catch her, Discord wins!"
Fluttershy,That big... dumb... MEANIE!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, Applejack, last rope! Make it count!"
Rainbow Dash,Lemme go! I don't need you guys! Leave me alone! Wh-what happened? [gasp] How's Ponyville? Where are the Elements?! Did we stop Discord?
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe it's a little early for a group hug.
Discord,"[laughter] Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing."
Twilight Sparkle,Not as wonderful as friendship.
Discord,"Oh, this again?"
Applejack,That's right. You couldn't break apart our friendship for long.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'll tell you what we've learned, Discord: we've learned that friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for!"
Discord,"Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead. Try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here."
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!"
Discord,Huh. What's this? No. NO!!!
Princess Celestia,We are gathered here today to once again honor the heroism of these six friends who stood up to the villain Discord and saved Equestria from eternal chaos.
Twilight Sparkle,Quill.
Spike,Check.
Twilight Sparkle,Parchment.
Spike,Check.
Twilight Sparkle,Extra ink.
Spike,Check.
Twilight Sparkle,Extra extra ink.
Spike,Check.
Twilight Sparkle,Is that everything on the checklist?
Spike,Yep.
Twilight Sparkle,"Great. Now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things I have to get done by the end of the day. Ready?"
Spike,Ready!
Twilight Sparkle,Item one: create checklist of the things I have to accomplish by the end of the day.
Twilight Sparkle,"How are we doing, Spike?"
Spike,"Let's see... We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaners, returned the blackboard you borrowed from Cheerilee, ordered new parchment and quills from the stationery shop..."
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm... Seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago.
Spike,Can't imagine why we go through so many of them.
Twilight Sparkle,Sounds like we're ahead of schedule. What's next?
Spike,Cupcakes!
Spike,Whoa...
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, I only ordered twelve."
Mrs Cake,"Oh, I know, dear, but I had an extra. So I thought I'd make it a baker's dozen."
Spike,Uhhh-no!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, that was very thoughtful of you. It's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it. See?"
Mrs Cake,Ohh... sure...
Twilight Sparkle,It's just that I'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and I don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing.
Mrs Cake,"Oh, no... of course not."
Twilight Sparkle,"Not to worry, I'll just move some of this one to... hmm... I think I may have scooped too much... oops! Now those two have more. Let's just try this again... Hmm, no, that won't do. Let me just... hmm... put some here, and... no, that's not right. A little more on this one, a little bit... and wait... I'll just... ooh, a little bit here, and here, and... perfect!"
Mrs Cake,"Hmm, oh yes... much better..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, time to tackle the next item on our-- oops! Looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list."
Twilight Sparkle,Very efficient! And a little bit gross.
Spike,Eh.
Spike,Looks like that's everything!
Twilight Sparkle,Almost everything.
Spike,"""Triple-check checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist!"" Uh... check! Ugh... I've been holding that quill so long, I've got a claw cramp! Well, good thing we don't have anything to report to Princess Celestia this week... I don't think I could write another word!"
Twilight Sparkle,We haven't sent a letter to Princess Celestia this week?!
Spike,Why? Is that bad?
Twilight Sparkle,"Bad? BAD? Of course it's bad! I'm supposed to send Princess Celestia a letter every week, telling her about a lesson I've learned about friendship! Not every other week, not every ten days, every... single... week!"
Spike,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"Ohh... Where's my calendar, where's my calendar?!"
Spike,Where it.. always is?
Twilight Sparkle,When did we send the last one?
Spike,Last... Tuesday?
Twilight Sparkle,And today is...
Spike,Tuesday?
Twilight Sparkle,"Argh! Nononononononono! If I don't send her a letter by sundown, I'll be... tardy!"
Spike,What's that now?
Twilight Sparkle,"Tar-dy, Spike! Late, I'll be late! Oh, how could I let this happen? I'm usually so organized. I've never been late with an assignment."
Spike,"Oh, please! You're the most studious student ever! I'm sure the Princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline."
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike. This is the ruler of all of Equestria we're talking about. The pony who holds my fate in her hooves! What if she doesn't forgive me?"
Spike,Yeah... I don't think she--
Twilight Sparkle,What if instead she starts thinking I'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?
Spike,Why would she--
Twilight Sparkle,What if she makes me come back to Canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove I've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?! What if I don't pass?!
Spike,"Well, why wouldn't you pass--"
Twilight Sparkle,She's my teacher. Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass? They send them back a grade! But she won't just send me back a grade. She'll send me back to... magic kindergarten.
Spike,Twilight? Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Spike,That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! You're not going to be sent back to magic kindergarten.
Twilight Sparkle,You're right. I have no reason to worry. Because I'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to Princess Celestia before sundown!
Twilight Sparkle,"So... got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that I as a good friend could help you solve?"
Spike,Huh. Hmm. Huunh. Huh... I got nothin'.
Twilight Sparkle,[sigh] Then it looks like I'm going to have to find somepony who does.
Spike,[sigh] This won't end well.
Twilight Sparkle,"You've got this, Twilight. You still have plenty of time to get that letter to Princess Celestia! Has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend!"
Twilight Sparkle,Rarity!
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!"
Rarity,"[sobbing] Why me-e-e-e-e-ee... [gasp] WHYYYY?! Why? Why-y?! And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!"
Twilight Sparkle,What's happened? Are you alright?
Rarity,"[gasp] I've lost my diamond-encrusted purple ribbon! I have searched high, and I have searched low. Low and high! High and low! But I can't find it anywhere! Anywhe-e-e-e-ere! How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Never fear, Rarity. As your friend I'll do my best to help you fi--"
Rarity,"Oh, there it is. Isn't it always just the last place you look?"
Twilight Sparkle,So... you just lost your ribbon?
Rarity,Mm-hm!
Twilight Sparkle,But now you've found it?
Rarity,Yuh-huh.
Twilight Sparkle,"And nothing else is bothering you? Nothing that I, as a good friend, could help you with?"
Rarity,Hmm... there is one thing.
Twilight Sparkle,Yes?
Rarity,I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there. Could you get that for me?
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Measuring tape? Sure.
Rarity,Twilight? Is there something bother-- Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,No need to panic. Rarity is just one pony. I'm sure one of my other friends will need me.
Twilight Sparkle,"What in the world...? Rainbow must be angry with Applejack! She must hate her guts! How wonderful! Rainbow Dash! Stop! Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset with Applejack, but don't worry. Whatever it is that has come between you two, I'm sure that I, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, what are you talking about?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me! I can tell you two must've had a terrible fight."
Twilight Sparkle,"Now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with Applejack."
Rainbow Dash,I don't have any issues with Applejack.
Twilight Sparkle,You don't? Then why are you destroying her property?
Rainbow Dash,"Because she asked me to. Right, Applejack?"
Applejack,"Yes, ma'am. I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first. Hehe. Now get back to it, R.D."
Rainbow Dash,"You got it, boss!"
Applejack,I'd take cover if I were you.
Twilight Sparkle,"[sigh] I can't believe I wasted all that time. I should have just come here first. Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over. As a good friend, I'll be able to help her."
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy?
Twilight Sparkle,"How can this be happening? Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?! What am I going to do?!"
Fluttershy,You really should have come to me sooner. You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder.
Twilight Sparkle,It's fine. It'll all be fine. The day isn't over yet. But it will be over soon!
Twilight Sparkle,[groans] It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville! My advanced studies! Nono. You're a good student. You can do this. Ooh! But what if I can't? You can! You just have to keep it together. Keep. It. Together!
Spike,Are you talking to... yourself? Twilight?
Spike,Snap out of it!
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Spike,Are you okay?
Spike,"Twilight, I'm really worried. I mean this letter thing is really getting to you. Here. You've been so anxious all day that you completely forgot about the picnic. Why don't you just relax and go hang out with--"
Twilight Sparkle,The picnic! I should go see my friends!
Spike,I'm glad you've come to your senses.
Rarity,"Please tell me I did not forget the plates. [gasp] I did. I totally forgot them. Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! [cries] Why, why, why... Uh... What? You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?"
Applejack,"You alright, hun?"
Twilight Sparkle,No! I am not alright.
Twilight Sparkle,It's just terrible.
Others,"Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Yes?"
Twilight Sparkle,Simply awful.
Others,"Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Yes?!"
Twilight Sparkle,It's the most horrific trouble I've ever been in and I really really really need your help!
Others,"Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, YES?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"My letter to Princess Celestia is almost overdue, and I haven't learned anything about friendship!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, thank goodness. I thought something really awful had happened."
Twilight Sparkle,"[strangled noises] Something awful has happened! If I don't turn in the letter on time, I'll be tardy! TARDY!"
Applejack,"No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'."
Twilight Sparkle,This is not nothing. This is everything. I need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem I can fix before sundown! My whole life depends on it!
Applejack,Come on now. Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff.
Fluttershy,Wow. I've never seen Twilight so upset before.
Rarity,"Oh, what a drama queen. Mm. Relatively speaking..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Clock is ticking, Twilight. Clock. Is. Ticking. Keep it together. If I can't find a friendship problem... I'll make a friendship problem!"
Apple Bloom,"Oh, hi, Twilight. How's it go--"
Twilight Sparkle,"Gr-eat. Just great. You three look like you're doing great too! Looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend. This is Smarty Pants. She was mine when I was your age, and now I want to give her to you!"
Scootaloo,Uhh... she's... great.
Apple Bloom,Yeah. Great.
Sweetie Belle,I really... like her... mane.
Twilight Sparkle,"She even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework!"
Scootaloo,That's... um... great.
Apple Bloom,Yeah... great.
Sweetie Belle,I really like her... mane?
Twilight Sparkle,"I just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem! I'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends. So, who wants to play with her first?"
Apple Bloom,"Uh... You should play with her first, Sweetie Belle. Y'know, 'cause you like her mane so much."
Sweetie Belle,Nonononononono. I think Scootaloo should get to play with her first.
Scootaloo,"I'd love to, but, um, you take her, Apple Bloom."
Apple Bloom,Applejack says it's important to share.
Twilight Sparkle,"[thinking] I gotta think of something! Thinkthinkthinkthinkthink Twilight, think! [gasp] That's it! [aloud] Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants. And you're going to like her more than anything."
Scootaloo,[gasp] I want it.
Apple Bloom,I need it.
Sweetie Belle,I really like her mane!
Twilight Sparkle,"The 'want it, need it' spell. Works every time. Okay, okay, let's break it up. I think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about-- Ugh! C'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right? Don't you think you ought to share?"
Apple Bloom,No way!
Twilight Sparkle,[annoyed groan] Big McIntosh! Thank goodness! You've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, thank you so much. Now if you could just give her to me?"
Big McIntosh,Nnnope.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh no!
Apple Bloom,Give her back!
Mayor Mare,What's all the commotion about?
Orange Swirl,They're fighting over that doll!
Sweetie Drops,"That incredible, amazing doll!"
Mayor Mare,Gimme!
Big McIntosh,Nope.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, what have I done?!"
Applejack,Y'all hear that? What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?!
Twilight Sparkle,Don't look at it!
Rarity,Don't look at what?
Twilight Sparkle,My Smarty Pants doll! I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her!
Fluttershy,Why would you enchant your doll?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I had to do something! I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia! I thought if I couldn't find a problem, I'd make a problem! The day is almost over!"
Applejack,Not almost!
Princess Celestia,Twilight Sparkle!
Applejack,Whoa nelly.
Princess Celestia,Meet me in the library.
Twilight Sparkle,"Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit, I'll be in magic kindergarten, back in Canterlot."
Fluttershy,Magic kindergarten?
Rainbow Dash,Canterlot?
Pinkie Pie,We're never gonna see Twilight again!
Applejack,"Uh, what are we gonna do, y'all?"
Rarity,"Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! What? I really mean it this time!"
Twilight Sparkle,But...but... I'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week. I missed the deadline. I'm a bad student! I'm... tardy!
Princess Celestia,"You are a wonderful student, Twilight. I don't have to get a letter every week to know that."
Twilight Sparkle,Really?
Rainbow Dash,Wait!
Pinkie Pie,You can't punish her!
Applejack,It wasn't her fault!
Princess Celestia,I'm listening.
Fluttershy,"Please, your Highness. We all saw that Twilight was upset."
Rainbow Dash,But we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.
Applejack,"So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her."
Rarity,"As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!"
Fluttershy,Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her.
Princess Celestia,Looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today.
Others,"Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Mm-hmm."
Princess Celestia,"Very well. I'll forget Twilight's ""punishment"" on one condition."
Princess Celestia,"From this day forth, I would like you all to report to me your findings on the magic of friendship when, and only when, you happen to discover them."
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia, wait! How did you know I was in trouble?"
Princess Celestia,"Your friend Spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you. I commend him for taking your feelings seriously. Now, if you will all excuse me, I must return to Canterlot. I'm expecting some mail."
Applejack,"Y'all heard the Princess. Spike, take a letter."
Applejack,"[clears throat] Dear Princess Celestia,"
Applejack,We're writin' to you because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship.
Fluttershy,We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.
Rainbow Dash,Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about.
Rarity,And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem...
Pinkie Pie,...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem.
Applejack,"Signed, your loyal subjects."
Spike,"P.S. Obviously Spike did not have to learn a lesson, because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for. Unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and- Eheh... uh... yeah... I'll just, um..."
Spike,"Ugh, come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late for the Nightmare Night festival. Huh? Are you that one kooky grandpa from Ponyville Retirement Village?"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm Star Swirl the Bearded! Father of the amniomorphic spell? Did you even read that book I gave you about obscure unicorn history?
Fillies,Nightmare Night! What a fright! Give us something sweet to bite!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hi, everypony. Great costumes. Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith."
Granny Smith,I should have been asleep five hours ago.
Pipsqueak,"Pipsqueak the pirate, at your service. It's my very first Nightmare Night."
Twilight Sparkle,Since you moved here from Trottingham?
Pipsqueak,"No, my very first Nightmare Night ever!"
Pinkie Pie,[chicken squawk] Enough chitchat! Time is candy!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this?"
Pinkie Pie,Too old for free candy? [chicken squawk] Never.
Twilight Sparkle,[bell jingles] Do you like it?
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! Great costume, Twilight! You make a fantastic weirdo clown!"
Twilight Sparkle,A clown? Look at the borders on these robes. These are hoof-stitched!
Spike,It's a great costume! Huh! Grandpa!
Twilight Sparkle,Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most important conjurer of the pre-classical era.
Background ponies,Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,"He created more than two hundred spells! He even has a shelf in the Canterlot library of magic named after him. Maybe I should start up a pony group to teach ponies about history. I bet everypony would love it! Don't you, Spike?"
Spike,[chewing candy] Mm-hmm! [eating sounds] I love it!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey look, we're here already! Should we get something to eat?"
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, Twilight! Look at our haul! Ah! Can you believe it? And then, we went to Cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies. Didn't we, Pip?"
Pipsqueak,Sure did!
Pinkie Pie,"And then, we had to stop and wait for Granny Smith, and -<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, that wasn't very nice."
Rainbow Dash,"Lighten up, old-timer. This is the best night of the year for pranks!"
Twilight Sparkle,Look what you did to Spike!
Rainbow Dash,It's all in good fun. Oh! Oh! There's another group over there!
Twilight Sparkle,"Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack!"
Applejack,"Howdy, Spike! Hey, Twilight! Nice costume."
Spike,Thanks! I'm a dragon.
Twilight Sparkle,"She means me, Spike."
Applejack,"With that beard, I reckon you're some sorta country music singer."
Applejack,"While y'all are here, ya' feel like bobbin' for an apple?"
Mayor Mare,"Thank you, everypony, and welcome to the Nightmare Night festival!"
Spike,Spooky voice might work better if she wasn't dressed like that.
Zecora,"Follow me, and very soon, you'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon."
Zecora,"Listen close, my little dears, I'll tell you where you got your fears of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary. [blows] Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary."
Zecora,"Every year, we put on a disguise, to save ourselves from her searching eyes."
Zecora,But Nightmare Moon wants just one thing: to gobble up ponies in one quick swing!
Zecora,"Hungrily, she soars the sky. If she sees nopony, she passes by. So if she comes and all is clear, Equestria is safe another year!"
Pipsqueak,"Uh, Miss Zecora, if we wear costumes to hide from Nightmare Moon, so she won't gobble us up, how come we still need to give her some of our candy?"
Zecora,"A perfect question, my little friend. For Nightmare Moon you must not offend. [blows] Fill up her belly with a treat or two, so she won't return to come eat you!"
Pinkie Pie,[screaming] Everypony! Just dump some candy and get out of here!
Pinkie Pie,[gasp] It's Nightmare Moon! Run!
Twilight Sparkle,[awestruck] Princess Luna!
Princess Luna,"[booming voice] Citizens of Ponyville! We have graced your tiny village with our presence, so that you might behold the real Princess of the Night! A creature of nightmares no longer, but instead a pony who desires your love and admiration! Together we shall change this dreadful celebration into a bright and glorious feast!"
Pinkie Pie,"Did you hear that, everypony? Nightmare Moon says she's gonna feast on us all!"
Princess Luna,"[normal voice] What? No, children, no! You no longer have reason to fear us! Screams of delight is what your princess desires, not screams of terror! [stomps hoof] Madame Mayor, thy Princess of the Night hath arrived."
Princess Luna,"What is the matter with you? Very well, then. Be that way. We won't even bother with the traditional royal farewell."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm gonna go talk to her.
Spike,You can't talk to her! She's Nightmare Moon!
Twilight Sparkle,"No, she's not. I saw the Elements of Harmony change her back to good. But it seems like she's having some trouble adjusting after being gone for a thousand years."
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Luna? Hi, my name is-"
Princess Luna,Star Swirl the Bearded. Commendable costume! Thou even got the bells right.
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you! Finally! Somepony who gets my costume! Uh, I just came to welcome you to our celebration! My actual name is-"
Princess Luna,Twilight Sparkle. [booming voice] It was thou who unleashed the powers of harmony upon us and took away our dark powers!
Twilight Sparkle,"And that was a good thing, right?"
Princess Luna,[normal voice] But of course. We could not be happier. Is that not clear?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, you kinda sound like you're yelling at me."
Princess Luna,"But this is the traditional royal Canterlot voice! It is tradition to speak using the royal ""we"", and to use [booming voice] this much volume when addressing our subjects!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, that might explain why your appearance was met with... mixed results. I think if you just changed your approach a bit, you might be met with a warmer reception."
Princess Luna,[booming voice] Change our approach?
Twilight Sparkle,Lower the volume?
Princess Luna,[normal voice] Ohhh. We have been locked away for a thousand years. We are... not sure we can.
Fluttershy,Go away! No candy here! Visitors not welcome on Nightmare Night!
Twilight Sparkle,"[nervous laughing] Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,[nervous laughter] Wait right here.
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?
Princess Luna,[booming voice] Charmed.
Fluttershy,[timidly] Likewise.
Princess Luna,[booming voice] Twilight Sparkle hath spoken of the sweetness of thy voice. We ask thou teachest to us to speak as thou speakest.
Fluttershy,[very quiet] Okay.
Princess Luna,[booming voice] Shall our lessons begin?
Fluttershy,[whisper] Okay.
Princess Luna,[booming voice] Shall we mimic thy voice?
Fluttershy,[quiet] Okay.
Princess Luna,[booming voice] How is this?
Fluttershy,"[hurriedly] Perfect, lesson over!"
Twilight Sparkle,"A little quieter, princess."
Princess Luna,[booming voice] How is... [loud voice] this?
Twilight Sparkle,"Better. Right, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy,"[nervous, dazed laughter] Yes."
Princess Luna,[loud voice] How... about... now?
Twilight Sparkle,Now you're getting it.
Princess Luna,[normal voice] And... how about now?
Twilight Sparkle,Yes! Well done.
Princess Luna,"[booming voice] I thank thee, dear Fluttershy! Our normal speaking voice shall surely win us the hearts of thy fellow villagers."
Pinkie Pie,Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us! Nightmare Moon is here and... [chicken squawk] Ah! She stole Fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she gobbles her up!
Princess Luna,"[booming voice] Nay, children, wait! [normal voice] I mean... nay, children, no, wait."
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, princess. Time for plan B."
All,Hurray!
Sassaflash,Aah!
Princess Luna,"It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle. They have never liked us and they never shall."
Twilight Sparkle,My friend Applejack is one of the most likable ponies around. I'm sure she'll have some ideas.
Pipsqueak,Heee...!
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh... Applejack, the princess is looking for a little advice on how to fit in around here."
Applejack,"""Fit in""? Really?"
Applejack,"I mean... that's easy! All you gotta do is have the right attitude. Loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun."
Princess Luna,"Fun? What is this ""fun"" thou speakest of? Pray tell, what purpose do these serve?"
Cherry Berry,Try to land the sp-sp-spiders on the web.
Applejack,"You can do it, princess!"
Princess Luna,"Ha! Your princess enjoys this ""fun""! In what other ways may we experience it?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Fire away, princess!"
Princess Luna,Ha ha! The fun has been doubled!
Applejack,"Why don't you try bobbin' for apples? We got the best apples in Equestria here, princess."
Princess Luna,"I ask that thou call us... me... Luna, fair Applejack. Hear me, villagers! All of you! Call me Luna!"
Princess Luna,Show me to these bobbing apples.
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip? We lost him the last time we had to run<U+0096> [chicken squawk] Aaah! Nightmare Moon is gobbling Pipsqueak! Everypony run!"
Pipsqueak,Help! My backside has been gobbled!
Princess Luna,"'Tis a lie! Thy backside is whole and ungobbled, thou ungrateful whelp! [hoof stomp, thunder] Fair villagers, please do not back away. Let us join together in... fun!"
Princess Luna,Not enough fun for you? What say you to this?!
Princess Luna,Huzzah! How many points do I receive?
Princess Luna,Do not run away!
Princess Luna,"As your princess, we command you!"
Princess Luna,[deafening voice] Be still!
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!"
Princess Luna,"[booming voice] No, Twilight Sparkle! We must use the traditional royal Canterlot voice for what we are about to say. Since you choose to fear your princess rather than love her, and dishonor her with this insulting celebration, we decree that Nightmare Night shall be canceled! Forever!"
Applejack,"[sigh] Shoot. We had everything goin' our way. Luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em."
Noi,[crying] But I wanted to be a zombie next year.
Twilight Sparkle,It's not over yet.
Applejack,What are you gonna do?
Twilight Sparkle,I'm going to do what I do best. Lecture her!
Twilight Sparkle,Princess?
Princess Luna,"Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle."
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess, I'm sorry it hasn't worked out how we wanted. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Nightmare Night is one of the most popular celebrations we have."
Princess Luna,Yes. I can tell. By all the adoring shrieks of the children as they run away.
Twilight Sparkle,Princess...
Twilight Sparkle,No! No shrieking. No screaming or squealing either. Okay?
Pinkie Pie,[muffled] Okay.
Twilight Sparkle,"There's something I want you to see. And I promise that it's safe, but you really, really, really can't shriek. Do you promise not to shriek?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you remember Princess Luna, right?"
Princess Luna,Ah. The ringleader of the frightened children. Hast thou come to make peace?
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow!
Twilight Sparkle,"She's changed, Pinkie! She's not evil or scary anymore! And she definitely doesn't want to gobble you up!"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, duh."
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Pinkie Pie,"I know that. Sheesh, Twilight. I'm almost as big as her, how's she gonna gobble me up?"
Twilight Sparkle,So why do you keep running away and screaming?
Pinkie Pie,Sometimes it's just really fun to be scared!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fun? Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!"
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Luna! I've finally figured out why you're having so much trouble being liked!
Princess Luna,[deadpan] Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm.
Twilight Sparkle,Come with me. I'll explain everything on the way.
Pipsqueak,Gosh. I never thought my very first Nightmare Night would be my very last.
Zecora,"Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret. Nightmare Night's not over yet. We still have candy left to give, so Nightmare Moon might let us live."
Mayor Mare,"Yes. Come on, little ponies. What's Nightmare Night without the annual candy offering? You don't want Nightmare Moon to gobble you up, do you?"
Spike,"Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me."
Applejack,"Come on, kids! Doesn't that sound like fun?"
Pipsqueak,"Goodbye, Nightmare Night. Forever."
Nightmare Moon,[booming voice] Citizens of Ponyville! You were wise to bring this candy to me. I am pleased with your offering. So pleased that I may just eat it... instead of eating you!
Princess Luna,"[spit] I am not certain that did what you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle."
Twilight Sparkle,Just wait.
Princess Luna,For what? For... for them to scream some more?
Pipsqueak,"Um... Princess Luna. I know there's not gonna be any more Nightmare Night, but do you suppose maybe you could come back next year and scare us again anyway?"
Princess Luna,Child. Art thou saying that thou... likest me to scare you?
Pipsqueak,"It's really fun! Scary, but fun!"
Princess Luna,It... is?
Pipsqueak,Yeah! Nightmare Night is my favorite night of the year.
Princess Luna,Well then. We shall have to bring [booming voice] Nightmare Night back!
Pipsqueak,"Whoa! You're my favorite princess ever! [to foals] She said yes, guys!"
Foals,YAY!
Twilight Sparkle,"See? They really do like you, princess."
Princess Luna,"Can it be true? [thunder, booming voice] Oh, most wonderful of -- [normal voice] I mean... Oh, most wonderful of nights."
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Twilight Sparkle,"When you first sent me to Ponyville, I didn't know anything about friendship. I met somepony tonight who was having the same problem -- your sister, Princess Luna! She taught me that one of the best things you can do with friendship is to give it to others, and help them find it themselves! And I'm happy to report that all of Ponyville has learned that even if somepony seems a little intimidating, even scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath. And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded costume didn't go over, this still turned out to be the best Nightmare Night ever!"
Sweetie Belle,"Rarity! Rrgh, you ruined the surprise! I was gonna serve you breakfast in bed!"
Hondo Flanks,"Well! G'mornin', Rarity!"
Rarity,Father! Mother!
Hondo Flanks,I'll have you know that Sweetie Belle here cooked this yummy lookin' breakfast all on her own.
Rarity,I... figured. [sniffs] I didn't know you could burn juice.
Cookie Crumbles,I've been giving her lessons. I wouldn't be surprised if she's got a cutie mark in fancy cooking by the time we get back from our vacation.
Rarity,Vacation? Is that this week? As in 'starting this very instant' this week?! Uurh. Let me guess: apple sauce?
Sweetie Belle,Nope. Toast! We're gonna have the bestest time two sisters could ever have! I'm gonna go grab my stuff from Dad's wagon.
Rarity,"So, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days?"
Cookie Crumbles,"And six nights, I know! Such a short time to spend with your little sis."
Hondo Flanks,You gonna eat that?
Rarity,"But I've got such a long to-do list. Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list."
Sweetie Belle,Just a few necessities.
Rarity,"Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up."
Sweetie Belle,Cleaned up? But we haven't even eaten yet.
Rarity,"Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt."
Sweetie Belle,It's not that burnt.
Rarity,"Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going."
Sweetie Belle,Can I help?
Rarity,"Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle. Let me just get things started."
Sweetie Belle,Rarity! I thought you said I was gonna help!
Rarity,You are! You... can... put the garnish on the plates.
Sweetie Belle,You mean this parsley?
Rarity,"Okay, now, easy! It has to be just right! No need to rush. No! That's too slow. Careful! Back up! Looking for perfection here..."
Sweetie Belle,"Whoa, whoa!"
Rarity,Not... bad.
Rarity,[gasp] There are some things I must attend to. Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?
Sweetie Belle,"No problem, I'll make myself useful!"
Rarity,Sweetie Belle!
Sweetie Belle,I told you I'd make myself useful. Surprised?
Rarity,Am I? You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater! Do you know how hard these things are to come by?
Sweetie Belle,What's the big deal?
Rarity,"The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool... shrinks."
Sweetie Belle,Oh. Sorry.
Rarity,Nng... Well. Back to work. I must create.
Sweetie Belle,Sorry?
Rarity,"Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay? Please?"
Sweetie Belle,I just wanted to do something nice for my sister.
Sweetie Belle,"Raargh, I'm so bored! When is Rarity gonna finish her work?"
Rarity,"[in Sweetie Belle's mind] Stay out of trouble, okay?"
Sweetie Belle,I never got in trouble for drawing. Hmm. This needs something...
Sweetie Belle,"Hi, Rarity! I made a special drawing for y<U+0096>"
Rarity,[screams] Oh no! Did you use these gems?!
Sweetie Belle,"Well, yes, but I know you'll have more in your work room..."
Rarity,"But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires! I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!"
Sweetie Belle,Oh. Sorry.
Rarity,"[sigh] Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?"
Sweetie Belle,"Oh! We could paint together, we could ride bikes, play chess, sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight<U+0096>"
Rarity,That's not what I meant!
Sweetie Belle,Oh.
Rarity,Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!
Sweetie Belle,I'll go with you and help!
Rarity,"No! No thank you. You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly. Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!"
Sweetie Belle,"Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?"
Sweetie Belle,Surprise!
Rarity,My- ee- bleh- My inspiration room! What did you do? What did you do?!
Sweetie Belle,"When I saw the big mess in your room, I thought I'd clean it up for you."
Rarity,"This wasn't a mess! It was organized chaos! I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you<U+0096> and you put everything away!"
Sweetie Belle,"But every time I make a mess, you get upset!"
Rarity,But this was my mess in my house! And now I have to start from scratch!
Sweetie Belle,"But, I thought it would make you happy!"
Rarity,Happy?! Happy?! I<U+0096> [grinds teeth] I just need some time alone. Hm!
Apple Bloom,How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'?
Sweetie Belle,"[mimicking Rarity] Why, it's smashing!"
Apple Bloom,Huh?
Sweetie Belle,I just wish we could do something special together that didn't include me goofing anything up.
Apple Bloom,The Sisterhooves Social! Applejack an' I do it every year! You an' Rarity can compete against other sister teams in all these neat events!
Sweetie Belle,That sounds like the perfect way for us to hang out! Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.
Rarity,What a ridiculous idea. A contest at Sweet Apple Acres? It doesn't sound... very... clean.
Sweetie Belle,"So, what, now you're back to hating messes?"
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle, watch your tone! I am still your big sister."
Sweetie Belle,Right! And any sister who cares about her sister goes!
Rarity,Sweetie Belle...! Honestly! Playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth! With or without a sister.
Sweetie Belle,"Well then! Maybe, maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves Social without a sister! In fact, I think I'll try the rest of my life without a sister!"
Rarity,"[gasp] Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?! Really?! Have you looked around this place? I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!"
Sweetie Belle,Well it looks like we finally agree on something! Neither of us needs a sister!
Rarity,Deal!
Sweetie Belle,"Deal! Goodbye, un-sister!"
Rarity,Hmph!
Applejack,'Uncouth'? She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?
Apple Bloom,Yeah! Uncouth? [belch] Wait. What's uncouth?
Sweetie Belle,It's not just the Social. She thinks I'm uncouth.
Applejack,"Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth."
Apple Bloom,[with mouth full] What's uncouth?
Applejack,"It means uncivil. Y'know, bad mannered?"
Applejack,"Exactly. Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time. She'll come around. Sisters always do."
Sweetie Belle,Not sisters like Rarity.
Applejack,"Come on, now. Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on. Maybe you can help!"
Sweetie Belle,You sure you want me to help? I just mess everything up!
Applejack,"Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. Watch!"
Applejack,"Good catch there, Apple Bloom! Whoo!"
Sweetie Belle,This is a chore?
Applejack,"Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat."
Apple Bloom,"It's a lot of work, so we make a game of it. Wanna try?"
Sweetie Belle,"Um, okay. Ow! You're right, it is hard work."
Apple Bloom,That's why we do it...
Applejack and Apple Bloom,Together!
Sweetie Belle,"Huh, Rarity never wants to do chores together."
Rarity,"Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle. Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here. [gasp] Id-ee-a! This is genius! I shall call it 'full spectrum fashions'! If Sweetie Belle hadn't<U+0096> [clears throat] Well, no matter. She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. Hm!"
Applejack,Apple Bloom! You're up!
Sweetie Belle,You're... making... grape juice? Rarity would call the fashion police on me if I got grape juice anywhere near her precious outfits.
Apple Bloom,"Well, that's silly!"
Applejack,Apple Bloom...
Sweetie Belle,"Please, Applejack, she didn't mean<U+0096>"
Applejack,"How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!"
Rarity,"Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line. Ooh, my favorite sweater... I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle."
Rarity,"Oh, Opal-wopal! It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you. And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right. Hm."
Applejack,Apple Bloom!
Apple Bloom,"Got it, sis!"
Sweetie Belle,Wow. It's as if they were just one pony.
Applejack and Apple Bloom,Yee-haw!
Applejack,"Way to corral some critters, sis!"
Sheep,You coulda just a-a-a-asked.
Sweetie Belle,Rarity never high-hoofs me.
Rarity,"Perfect! Just one more, and this ensemble is fini! Rrgh, Sweetie Belle! Where's her silly little arts and crafts project?"
Rarity,"Oh, Sweetie Belle! My one and only sister! What have I done? All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone! [crying dramatically] Woe is me! No! I must get her back! I must! As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again!"
Rarity,"[gasp] Sweetie Belle! Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you. I<U+0096>"
Sweetie Belle,"Oh hello, un-sister. What are you doing here? Better be careful, you might get some dust on you."
Rarity,"Oh, Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize. I am not better off without a sister."
Sweetie Belle,I'm not better off without a sister either. Spending the day with Applejack and Apple Bloom made me realize that.
Rarity,"Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear<U+0096>"
Sweetie Belle,And that's why I'm adopting Applejack as my big sister!
Rarity,What?!
Applejack,What?!
Apple Bloom,What?!
Sweetie Belle,A sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister. Applejack's a real sister.
Applejack,"H-Hold on, Sweetie Belle. Don't get ahead of yourself here."
Apple Bloom,"Besides, she's my big sister!"
Applejack,"Yeah, um<U+0096>"
Sweetie Belle,"[to Rarity] Or maybe she should be your sister, so she could teach you what a good sister is supposed to be!"
Applejack,"Heh, um, actually, I<U+0096>"
Rarity,"But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I-I promise! Listen! I'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche! Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane. Won't that be fun? Hm?"
Sweetie Belle,"Hm! You want me to go home with you, so we can do what you wanna do?"
Rarity,Uh... yes?
Sweetie Belle,Just forget it!
Apple Bloom,"We're still sisters, right?"
Rarity,"Well, that apology went swimmingly. Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?"
Applejack,"[chuckles] Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself. Bein' sisters is a give and take. You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'."
Rarity,But of course I give. I give lessons. Reasonable demands.
Applejack,"But ya never give in. Bein' sisters is like... apple pie. You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie."
Rarity,"But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess... [gasp] I know what I need to do! I just hope it isn't too late!"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, I guess it's a good thing Rarity isn't here. Do I see 'uncouth' written all over this contest?"
Apple Bloom,Look at the size of that pig!
Applejack,He sure is a cutie.
Sweetie Belle,"That's the last word Rarity would use. [mimicking Rarity] Oh my, what a repulsive monstrosity! This thing needs a head to toe makeover!"
Applejack,It's almost time!
Sweetie Belle,"Well, you two have fun. Sure wish I had a sister to run the race with. Huh?"
Apple Bloom,You do now!
Applejack,AB and I figured since we do this every year...
Apple Bloom,I'd let you borrow my sis so you can give it a try!
Applejack,Sister for a day.
Sweetie Belle,No way!
Apple Bloom,One. Day. One. Day.
Granny Smith,"Is this thing on? [to Big McIntosh] I don't think this thing is on. [to the megaphone] Hello! [Big McIntosh whispers into her ear] What is the- e- oh. You have to say so. Confangled modern doohickeys. Now, the event you've all been waiting fer! The Sister Soci- The Socialhooves- Oh, dabnabbit, you know, the big race! We have five teams this year fer the event! So y'all head on up to the finish line, y'hear? [Big McIntosh whispers into her ear] [to Big McIntosh] Eh? [to the megaphone] The start line! [to Big McIntosh] That's what I said."
Sweetie Belle,That's us.
Apple Bloom,One. Day. Good luck!
Granny Smith,And may the best sisters win! On your marks... get set... Gooooo!
Sweetie Belle,"You okay, Applejack?"
Sweetie Belle,"Applejack, help!"
Sweetie Belle,"You can do it, sister!"
Apple Bloom,"Ooh, so close! You almost won!"
Sweetie Belle,"Thank you, Applejack! You were amazing! I don't even care that we didn't win. This was so much fun! Huh? Rarity?! Wait, where's Applejack?"
Sweetie Belle,I don't get it.
Applejack,[chuckles] We switched places over at the very first mudhole.
Sweetie Belle,"So, we did the whole competition... together?"
Rarity,"That we did, little sister. Well, except for the start line."
Apple Bloom,But you finished together!
Sweetie Belle,You mean... you were all in on it?
Others,"Applejack, Mm-hmm."
Sweetie Belle,You did this for me?
Rarity,Us. I did it for us. You see? We are apple pie!
Sweetie Belle,Huh?
Rarity,"Uh, I'll explain later. For now, I think we deserve a celebration!"
Others,"Applejack, Yeah!"
Sweetie Belle,Where?
Rarity,"The spa, of course."
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, Rarity."
Rarity,"No, I-I-I'm serious."
Rarity,"Very well then, what should we write to the Princess?"
Sweetie Belle,I'll start. Having a sister is just about the bestest thing in the world. But it sure isn't the easiest.
Rarity,"I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. Sometimes it's about compromising. Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. But mostly, it's about having fun together. Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty."
Sweetie Belle,A lot dirty.
Rarity,A little bit dirty.
Sweetie Belle,A lot dirty.
Rarity,A little bit dirty!
Sweetie Belle,A lo<U+0096>
Spike,"Hold it, hold it! How about ""a medium amount of dirty, not too little, not too much, just right""?"
Rarity and Sweetie Belle,Deal!
Apple Bloom,"Today's the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can just feel it! Today's the day we are all gonna get our cutie marks in... bowlin'!"
Scootaloo,Whoo-hoo!
Sweetie Belle,"[muffled] Whooo! [spits out bag] I mean, yaay!"
Apple Bloom,"Why, after today, we won't even be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! We'll be the... the Three Strikes!"
Scootaloo,That makes us sound like we've struck out.
Apple Bloom,Mmm. How 'bout the Pin Twins?
Sweetie Belle,But there are three of us.
Apple Bloom,Okay then... Um... the Bowlin' Dolls!
Sweetie Belle,The Bowling Dolls! That's it!
Scootaloo,Perfect!
Apple Bloom,All righty then! Let's bowl 'em over!
Apple Bloom,Phpoo!
Sea Swirl,Cool! A bowling cutie mark!
Apple Bloom,I did it! I did it! Blank?
Apple Bloom,But... but... what about my ball?
Sweetie Belle,"That bowling sure was fun, even if all I got was gutter balls."
Scootaloo,"Yeah, at least you were able to keep your ball in your lane. I don't think Mr. Kingpin is ever gonna let me play again! Hey, maybe I could get my cutie mark in demolition!"
Scootaloo,"Aw, come on, Apple Bloom."
Sweetie Belle,I know just what you need to put the bloom back on your apple.
Sweetie Belle,A treat from Sugarcube Corner will cheer you up.
Apple Bloom,"No, it won't."
Pinkie Pie,A party will cheer you up!
Apple Bloom,"No, it won't."
Rarity,A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.
Apple Bloom,"No, it won't."
Scootaloo,"Come on, Apple Bloom, it's just a cutie mark!"
Sweetie Belle,Or lack of a cutie mark!
Scootaloo,"Shh! That's not helping! Apple Bloom! Where are you going?! Apple Bloom, come back!"
Apple Bloom,Whoa! Ah! Ooh! Ow! Nnnn...
Zecora,"Well, who is it that we have here? Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear!"
Apple Bloom,Ow...
Zecora,"What has happened to you, youth? Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth. Come with me, I have just the trick that will fix you up quite quick."
Apple Bloom,"[with a lisp] I've tried everything, Zecora, and still no cutie mark! Well, I'm gonna be as old as Granny Smith and still have a blank flank!"
Zecora,"Your frustration is well understood, but one must be patient for all things good."
Apple Bloom,"[with a lisp] Ugh, I've heard that from every pony I know! And now from every zebra I know! I'm just too impatient to be patient. I just want my cutie mark and I want it now!"
Zecora,"For your cutie mark, you will have to wait. We must fix that tooth before it's too late. Now drink down every little drop, and this mixture will mend that chip on top!"
Apple Bloom,"[glug, glug] Oh my star apples, you did it, Zecora! Golly, you have tonics that heal all sorts of ailments. Bad bones, bad back, bad breath..."
Zecora,"Yes little one, it is true, I have many a healing brew."
Apple Bloom,"And not only stuff that fixes the bad, but stuff that brings the good! Good health, good hair... good heavens! Hmm... I bet you can mix up a brew to fix... anything."
Zecora,"There are many mixtures in this room, but none for what you want, dear Apple Bloom. A magic potion does not hold the key. For a cutie mark, time is the only remedy."
Apple Bloom,Fine. Whatcha got goin' on there?
Zecora,"I am brewing up another mix for a rooster and his chicks. [muffled] It seems the rooster has lost his crow, [normal] making mornings very slow."
Apple Bloom,"Hey, I've seen that flower bloomin' in Ponyville! What is it?"
Zecora,"It is one we call 'Heart's Desire'. A dash will ignite the rooster's fire. With Heart's Desire, his talent comes into view, and he'll give a mighty cock-a-doodle-doo!"
Apple Bloom,"Zowie! Heart's Desire, huh?"
Zecora,"Ay me, but what is this? I have run out of amethyst. I must go get this purple flower for my brew to have full power!"
Apple Bloom,"Yeah, you go, you go."
Sweetie Belle,I'm so hungry.
Scootaloo,"Yeah, I can't wai--"
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,Aah! Apple Bloom! You got your cutie mark!
Sweetie Belle,"Um, Apple Bloom... what is it?"
Scootaloo,Yeah! Is it an 'o'? Is your talent spelling?
Sweetie Belle,Or is it a ring? Are you a jewelry maker?
Twist,Or is it a powdered donut? 'Cause that sounds delicious.
Apple Bloom,"No, it's a loop-de-hoop!"
Scootaloo,[gasp] A what now?
Apple Bloom,"A loop-de-hoop! 'Least, that's what I always called it. Applejack made it for me from an old rain barrel when I was littler! Who woulda thought that loop-de-hoop would end up bein' my special talent?"
Sweetie Belle,"Wow, Apple Bloom, that's amazing!"
Diamond Tiara,That's it? That's your talent?
Silver Spoon,Spinning a hoop around your waist? Puh-lease.
Apple Bloom,"Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet."
Scootaloo,"Apple Bloom, you're super-duper-loop-de-hooper!"
Apple Bloom,"Thanks, everypony!"
Cheerilee,"All right, my little ponies, time for class!"
Cheerilee,Apple Bloom?
Apple Bloom,"Yes, Miss Cheerilee?"
Cheerilee,I want you to take your loop-de-hoop into the yard... and give us all a lesson in your amazing loop-de-hooping!
Apple Bloom,"Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you might get to be half as good as me!"
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon,Grr...
Apple Bloom,"Great job, girls!"
Sweetie Belle,"You're too kind, Apple Bloom."
Scootaloo,"Yeah, we stink."
Apple Bloom,"Nah, you just need a little practice. Soon you'll be able to... hoop and bop! Hoop and hop! [muffled] Hoop and skip! [normal] And hoop and flip!"
Cheerilee,"[laughs] Show us some more, Apple Bloom."
Apple Bloom,"Well, all right, just a few more tricks. But be warned! These are advanced moves, not for beginners. Got that, Diamond Tiara?"
Apple Bloom,I call this one the hoop-la! [makes helicopter noises] Huh? Oof!
Diamond Tiara,Another cutie mark? Hah! I guess that last trick was a lot of hoopla. Those cutie marks are fake!
Apple Bloom,What? No they're not!
Diamond Tiara,"Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard of a pony with two cutie marks?"
Cheerilee,"I must say that I never have, but maybe Apple Bloom has two special talents!"
Silver Spoon,Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that!
Snips,Spin plates!
Snails,Yeah!
Sweetie Belle,Two cutie marks?
Scootaloo,Two talents?
Apple Bloom,Aw yeah!
Sweetie Belle,Our friend is the most...
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,...special pony ever!
Apple Bloom,"Alright, everypony, You ready for a real show?"
Applejack,"Yee-haw, little sis! Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks! We're mighty proud of you, right, Big McIntosh?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,"I've never seen anythin' like it. Have you, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh,Nnnope.
Granny Smith,"Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin' reminded me of when I was a spry young filly. Guh, charley horse, charley horse! Ooh, that's better."
Applejack,"Why, Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!"
Apple Bloom,"Actually, I'm ready to hit the hay right now. I'm plum tuckered. I'll see y'all in the mornin'. Night!"
Applejack,"Night! Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Applejack,"[grunting] What in tarnation is that? Apple Bloom, what is all that awful... tapping? [gasp] Three cutie marks?!"
Apple Bloom,Help me!
Apple Bloom,Help me!
Applejack,"C'mere, you! Ow! Ow! Whoa!"
Apple Bloom,"I'm sorry, Applejack! I dunno how to make it stop!"
Applejack,"Well, I know somepony who might!"
Twilight Sparkle,Three cutie marks. Three talents. I've never seen anything like it! I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses. What was it?
Spike,"""Perplexing Pony Plagues"", perhaps?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, Spike, you're amazing!"
Spike,"Yes, well, I do have some talents."
Twilight Sparkle,Hay fever... the trots... [gasp] Cutie pox!
Others,"Apple Bloom, Cutie pox?!"
Twilight Sparkle,Cutie pox. This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the Paleopony Period!
Spike,"Heh, say that ten times fast!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them!"
Apple Bloom,Just like me!
Applejack,"Yes, but what's the cure? What's the cure?!"
Twilight Sparkle,It says here there's no known cure!
Others,"Apple Bloom, No known cure?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!"
Apple Bloom,"Oh, no! Sacr<e9> bleu! Plus de marques de cutie! [gasp] Qu'est-ce c'est?! Je parle Fran<e7>ais?!"
Applejack,My sister's speakin' in fancy!
Twilight Sparkle,She needs help!
Applejack,I know she needs help! We can't just wait for this to go away! We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! And fast!
Apple Bloom,Tout de suite!
Twilight Sparkle,Not some pony... some zebra!
Applejack,Zecora!
Applejack,"Hurry, hurry!"
Apple Bloom,D<e9>p<ea>chez-vous!
Lily Valley,She's cursed!
Rose,Hexed!
Daisy,Enchanted!
Spike,"No, she's not."
Spike,She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox.
Pony,She's got the cutie pox!
Zecora,I thought I had removed their fear the last time that I visited here. But doors are barred and shutters shut. Guess I should've stayed inside my hut.
Twilight Sparkle,Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox! We were just on our way to see if you had a cure!
Applejack,But magically you're here! Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?
Zecora,"My 'zebra sense' did not bring me round, it was a special flower that I needed found. I thought I picked enough to fix all the potions I had to mix, but after my visit from Apple Bloom, some had mysteriously left my room. Apple Bloom! What do you say? Did this flower just walk away?"
Apple Bloom,"I, um..."
Zecora,"A cutie pox cure I have forsooth, for healing power is in the Seeds of Truth."
Applejack,"Well, well then give 'em to her! Quick!"
Zecora,"These seeds must be planted in the ground. With the truth, they'll grow, and the cure is found."
Applejack,Come again?
Zecora,"The Seeds of Truth do hold the cure, but one must speak words, true and pure."
Applejack,"Well then let's get to it! Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!"
Apple Bloom,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Applejack,Somepony! Anypony!
Pinkie Pie,"Yesterday I told Mrs. Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three! Okay, six! I ate six corn cakes! [cries] Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!"
Apple Bloom,"Wah, I can't stand it any more! It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn my cutie mark! They're all fake! I figured the Heart's Desire would help me get what I wanted most! So when Zecora left her hut, I mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it!"
Apple Bloom,"[chomps, chews and swallows] Ahh."
Sweetie Belle,Apple Bloom!
Scootaloo,Are you okay?
Apple Bloom,"I'm great, and I've never been happier to be a blank flank. But I'm awful sorry I lied, 'specially to you gals. I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away. And I'm really sorry I snuck those flowers from you, Zecora. Why, I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again."
Zecora,"Now, Apple Bloom, do not be silly. You are always welcome, my little filly. With each mistake you learn something new, growing up into a better you."
Twilight Sparkle,"Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned?"
Apple Bloom,"I'd be happy to, Twilight! Spike?"
Spike,Ready!
Apple Bloom,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Apple Bloom,"Waiting for what your heart desires can be really hard. So, you may try to take a shortcut. But this dishonesty never works, because you didn't earn what your heart desired. The only cure is being honest with yourself and others. And that's something every heart desires."
Applejack,"I sure am proud of you, sis. Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience."
Apple Bloom,Yup! All good things come to those who wait. Well! I've waited long enough.
Scootaloo,"Actually, that was way too long."
Applejack,What?!
Apple Bloom,So what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks?
Scootaloo,"Well, I was thinking, for a pony who's never mixed up a potion before, you sure stirred up something fierce."
Sweetie Belle,Yeah! So what if your talent is potion making?
Apple Bloom,"Oh my gosh, totally! Let's go talk to Zecora, now!"
Sweetie Belle,Yeah!
Scootaloo,Woo-hoo!
Rainbow Dash,Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! [laughs] Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,"Winona? I mean... Winona's head?! Um, is this weird, or is it just me? Angel? Gummy?! Okay, this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town."
Rainbow Dash,[gasp] Yaaaaah!
Rainbow Dash,Whaa!
Rainbow Dash,Phew.
Applejack,Let's get this thing started!
Rarity,"Sincerest apologies, Rainbow, if our pets were bothering you."
Rarity,"Say you're sorry, Opal."
Rarity,She's... sorry.
Rainbow Dash,What are you all doing out here?
Applejack,"Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' Pony Pet Playdate in this park."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, you do?"
Applejack,Same time every week.
Fluttershy,I thought you knew. You didn't know? She didn't know?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, except<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this."
Fluttershy,"Oh, please don't be mad at us."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, I'm not mad. You all are right. Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right?"
Applejack,"Eeexactly. So, if'n you'll excuse us..."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, now wait a minute! Just because I don't have a pet now doesn't mean I never want a pet!"
Fluttershy,"Ohh! Y, y, Oh, really? You really want a pet? Really? 'Cause I've got so many wonderful choices at my house! Oh, and I know you'll just love them! And they'll love you! Oh, and you'll be best friends forever and ever! Oh!"
Fluttershy,"Now, Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight It's abundantly clear That somewhere out here Is the pet that will suit you just right"
Rainbow Dash,"I can't wait to get started, but first let me set a few rules It's of utmost importance The pet that I get Is something that's awesome and cool"
Fluttershy,"Awesome, cool, got it! I have so many wonderful choices, just wait, you will see"
Rainbow Dash,I need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me
Fluttershy,Sure! How 'bout a bunny? They're cutesy and wootsie and quick as can be
Rainbow Dash,Cutesy? Wootsie? Have you even met me?
Fluttershy,"Rainbow, have faith You see, I will bet you Somewhere in here is the pet that will get you"
Fluttershy,"Come on, the sky's the limit!"
Rainbow Dash,Sky is good. I'd like it to fly.
Fluttershy,"Really? Because I think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over it. Yes, he does. Aww, look, he likes you!"
Rainbow Dash,Pass.
Fluttershy,I have so many wonderful choices for you to decide There are otters and seals With massive appeal
Rainbow Dash,Otters and seals do not fly.
Fluttershy,"Maybe not, but I've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water!"
Rainbow Dash,That's it. I'm outta here.
Fluttershy,"Wait! There must be a pet here That will fit the ticket How 'bout a ladybug, or a cute cricket?"
Rainbow Dash,Bigger. And cooler.
Fluttershy,"Bigger, cooler. Right."
Others,"I've got just the thing in that tree, Dash Meet your new fabulous pet, Squirrely!"
Rainbow Dash,It's just a squirrel.
Fluttershy,Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel!
Rainbow Dash,"...Yeah. So, like I was saying..."
Others,"Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it I need a pet to keep up with me Something awesome, something flying With coolness that defies gravity!"
Fluttershy,I'm sensing you want an animal that can fly.
Rainbow Dash,Ya think?
Fluttershy,I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky Like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly
Rainbow Dash,"Better, but cooler."
Fluttershy,"I see. How 'bout an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan? There's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that There are falcons and eagles They are both quite regal Or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat?"
Rainbow Dash,"Now you're talking! But instead of just one standout, now that's too many."
Others,"So many choices, and such riches aplenty"
Fluttershy,"Not a bad problem to have, if you ask me."
Rainbow Dash,"The bat would be awesome, but the wasp I'm digging too Do you have something in a yellow striped bat?"
Fluttershy,No.
Others,"I've got a hot pink flamingo, just dying to meet you"
Rainbow Dash,"What to do, what to do? [gasp] A prize! That's it! There's really just one way To find out which animal's best Hold a contest of speed, agility, and guts That will put each pet to the test"
Fluttershy,"Don't forget style, that should be considered"
Rainbow Dash,Then we'll know for sure who's best of the litter
Fluttershy,The one who is awesome as cool
Rainbow Dash,"Just like me Can't settle for less, 'cause I'm the best"
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,So a contest we will see
Rainbow Dash,"Who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet"
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,In the world for me!
Fluttershy,May the games
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,Begin!
Rainbow Dash,And may the best pet win!
Rainbow Dash,"[blows whistle] Shh! [to assembled animals] So! You all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya? Well, we'll just see about that! If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers. This competition isn't for the weak. You'd better be prepared to step up your game! You call that flapping?! That's better. There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme! Any questions?"
Applejack,I got one. Does she understand what a pet really needs?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, like care and attention, love and affection<U+0096> Ugh! And breath mints!"
Fluttershy,"Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,"Seriously, Fluttershy! The turtle? What did you bring that thing here for?"
Fluttershy,"Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet. He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. You won't even know he's here."
Rainbow Dash,No.
Fluttershy,"Oh, just let him try."
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, but there's no way he can possibly keep up. Look at him!"
Fluttershy,It won't hurt to let him try.
Rainbow Dash,But<U+0096>
Fluttershy,Just let him try?
Rainbow Dash,"Grrgh, ugh, fine! But don't say I didn't warn you! This isn't a game, you know! Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet. Speed. Agility. Guts. Style. Coolness. Awesomeness. And radicalness."
Twilight Sparkle,Aren't those all the same thing?
Rainbow Dash,"You would think that, Twilight. And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet."
Rainbow Dash,Speed! On your marks...
Rainbow Dash,Get set... [blows whistle] Sorta speedy... not speedy... pretty speedy... could be more speedy...
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! That's speed!
Rainbow Dash,[to the tortoise] Tsk-tsk. That's just sad.
Rainbow Dash,Agility! Sorta agile... not agile... pretty agile... could be more agile... [to the tortoise] Wanna know the opposite of agility? That.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, baby, now that's what I call agility! [sing-song voice] Don't leave me hangin'! I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that."
Rainbow Dash,Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and get Opal's favorite toy away from her?
Rainbow Dash,Now that takes guts!
Rainbow Dash,"Style! Any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good!"
Rainbow Dash,Coolness!
Rainbow Dash,Sorta cool.
Rainbow Dash,Not cool.
Rainbow Dash,Pretty cool.
Rainbow Dash,Could be cooler.
Rainbow Dash,Not what I had in mind. I can't hear you!
Rainbow Dash,Eugh.
Rainbow Dash,Now that's a cool sound!
Rainbow Dash,"[to bat] Sorta awesome. [to toucan] Not awesome. [to flamingo] Could be more awesome. [to owl] Ho ho ho, yeah, that is awesome! [to tortoise] Uh, you did that already. That's pretty much all you can do, huh?"
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa! That was truly awesome! But I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off."
Rainbow Dash,"[sigh] Listen, turtle..."
Fluttershy,Tortoise.
Rainbow Dash,"Whatever! You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't."
Rainbow Dash,You didn't.
Rainbow Dash,"I mean... 'A' for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home. You're starting to creep me out. So, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one. So the final tie-breaking contest is going to be... pause for dramatic effect... a race against... me! Through Ghastly Gorge! Dun dun dun!"
Rainbow Dash,Gesundheit.
Rainbow Dash,"Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary. It's fun. Heh. I've flown through it a million times myself, so obviously I'll be at the front of the pack. But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor and glory of getting to be my pet! Ready? Setgo!"
Rainbow Dash,Woo-hoo! Haha! Try to keep up!
Rainbow Dash,"Can't catch me, ha-ha!"
Rainbow Dash,"C'mon, slowpokes! You wanna win, don't ya?"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh! I forgot to tell you! Watch out for the Quarray eels! They don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this. Whoa."
Rainbow Dash,"Easy, peasy, one-two-threesy! Right, guys?"
Rainbow Dash,AVALANCHE! Hey! Whoaaaa!
Rainbow Dash,"C'mon... No! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me! I'm the one who's supposed to win! I don't wanna end up stuck here... forever! Oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening. Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge. I mean, it's like, forever! Somepony! Anypony! Help me!"
Rainbow Dash,"Wahoo! My prayers have been answered! Oh, thankyouthankyoutha<U+0096> You?! Oh no! Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here forever with the most annoying turtle in the world! Gyh, I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hm, something's not right here."
Fluttershy,Where's Rainbow Dash?
Applejack,Great galloping galoshes! There's been an avalanche in there!
Spike,Rainbow!
Pinkie Pie,Wait! Look!
Fluttershy,It's the turtle!
Others,"Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Tortoise!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, whatever..."
Twilight Sparkle,And he's carrying something on his back...
Pinkie Pie,Ahh! It's Rainbow Dash! It's her! It's Rainbow!
Fluttershy,Maybe we'd better go meet him halfway.
Spike,"Huh. Way to go, little guy!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, thank goodness you're not hurt, Rainbow!"
Rainbow Dash,Just my pride.
Applejack,"It sure was, if'n it means Rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on."
Rainbow Dash,Uh... thanks. What you did... I owe you one.
Fluttershy,Rainbow! Your new pet is over here waiting for you!
Rainbow Dash,Oh... Right... Yeah... That.
Spike,What's the matter?
Pinkie Pie,"You got your perfect pet, right?"
Fluttershy,"The best of the best like you wanted, remember? It can fly and it's not a squirrel! Should we sing about it again?"
Applejack,"A falcon sure looks good on ya, Rainbow."
Fluttershy,Yay?
Rainbow Dash,But I said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.
Pinkie Pie,"You did! You did say that! She did say that, that was the rule!"
Rainbow Dash,And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help. The tortoise!
Twilight Sparkle,But what about the<U+0096>
Applejack,Wouldja look at that? He even smiles slow.
Rainbow Dash,"Spike, take a letter. Dear Princess Celestia,"
Rainbow Dash,"I used to think that the most important traits to look for in a pet, or any best friend, were all physical competitive abilities. But now I can see how short-sighted and shallow that was."
Rainbow Dash,"Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit. A stick-to-it-ive-ness. A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it."
Twilight Sparkle,Tenacity.
Rainbow Dash,Gesundheit. You just can't stop that little guy. He's like a... like a... Tank!
Fluttershy,"But Rainbow! You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?"
Rainbow Dash,Hmm...
Rainbow Dash,"Heh. C'mon, Tank! We're gonna be late for our very first Pony Pet Playdate!"
Scootaloo,"Attention, everypony! Attention! The official Rainbow Dash Fan Club will come to order. Let's get right down to our first order of business. I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared the most awesome pony in Ponyville."
Snails,"I second the motion, and might I add that if you looked up the word 'awesome' in the dictionary, there would be a picture of Rainbow Dash."
Snips,I object!
Snips,I think the word 'awesome' is played out! Rainbow Dash deserves better! I motion that we declare her the most stupendous pony!
Scootaloo,'Stupendous'? Is that the best you've got? I motion that we declare her... wonderiffic!
Snips,Astonishing!
Scootaloo,Breathtaking!
Snips,Astounding!
Scootaloo,Bedazzling!
Rainbow Dash,What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?
Scootaloo,"All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'!"
Rainbow Dash,[sigh] What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed.
Aura,Help! Help! Help! Help!
Rainbow Dash,"Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!"
Rainbow Dash,"Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks, everypony. It was really no big deal."
Aura,"To me it was! You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!"
Scootaloo,That Rainbow Dash sure is something.
Snips and Snails,Something special.
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby!
Rainbow Dash,"She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!"
Scootaloo,There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness.
Twilight Sparkle,I can think of a few new words.
Applejack,And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.
Twilight Sparkle,"No, but she is kinda awesome."
Rainbow Dash,"Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!"
Pony 1,We'd be lost without you!
Pony 2,"You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!"
Crowd,Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,I can't hear you!
Crowd,Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
Twilight Sparkle,"Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head."
Pinkie Pie,You may be right...silly.
Rainbow Dash,"And then I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day."
Spike,That day.
Applejack,Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.
Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle,Mm-hm.
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?"
Applejack,Immorta-what?
Twilight Sparkle,Are you taking notes?
Spike,"Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about."
Rainbow Dash,"Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer."
Pinkie Pie,[yelps] Spike's a ghost!
Rainbow Dash,"...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike?"
Spike,Don't... you... Spike. Got it!
Rainbow Dash,"This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge."
Rainbow Dash,[grunts] There you go.
Others,"""Lemon Daze"": Someday, I wanna be just like you!"
Rainbow Dash,"Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible."
Cherry Berry,Help! Help!
Snips,"Uh, don't you think you should go and help?"
Rainbow Dash,"[muffled] Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more."
Spike,The tension is unbearable. Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?
Pony,"Holy turnips, that pony came outta nowhere!"
Daisy,I've never seen such bravery in all my life!
Mayor Mare,That's right! Ponyville has a new hero. A mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today. I dub this new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare Do Well'!
Rainbow Dash,"Mare Do Well, huh? Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!"
Rainbow Dash,"[clears throat] Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow<U+0096>"
Globe Trotter,"Excuse me, uh, do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us?!"
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa! Aah!"
Others,"""Wisp"": Oh, thank you, Mare Do We<U+0096> e..."
Rainbow Dash,"I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than me? Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way."
Crafty Crate,Huh?
Rainbow Dash,"Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighbor<U+0096> Whoa!"
Rainbow Dash,Never fear<U+0096> Uh! I'm coming! Hold on! Whoa!
Jack Hammer,Look!
Others,"""Jim Beam"": Look out for the<U+0096> Watch out for falling<U+0096> On your left! Agh! Your other left!"
Rainbow Dash,"Here ya go, safe and sound."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do Slow? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning."
Others,"""Rivet"": Actually, she saved all of us! We owe her our lives!"
Rainbow Dash,"[growls] Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game."
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps] If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy."
Rainbow Dash,"My game is officially back on. If only somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have do it myself<U+0096> [yelps] [screams] Help! [spits] Help! You?! I suppose you want me to thank<U+0096> You gotta be kidding me..."
Rainbow Dash,"Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with that? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, for the love of Pete."
Applejack,"Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats."
Twilight Sparkle,"I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study."
Fluttershy,She really cares about everypony's safety.
Rarity,Have you seen her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.
Applejack,And she's modest and humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that.
Rainbow Dash,I don't have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great!
Spike,She's... great.
Rainbow Dash,I didn't say that.
Twilight Sparkle,Sounds like somepony's jealous.
Rainbow Dash,"Who, me?"
Spike,Rainbow Dash is jealous.
Rainbow Dash,"Don't write that, Spike!"
Spike,Correction: Rainbow Dash is very jealous.
Rainbow Dash,"Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good<U+0096> no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well!"
Rainbow Dash,"Huh, no sign of trouble here. Darn it."
Rainbow Dash,Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?!
Rainbow Dash,"Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe? [gasps] Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're in way over your head here."
Granny Smith,"Eh, what's that?"
Rainbow Dash,"You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street!"
Granny Smith,"[grunting] Actually, I can cross the street just fine!"
Rainbow Dash,Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves!
Granny Smith,[panicked grunts] Back off!
Rainbow Dash,"[pants] Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?"
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] Somepony's in trouble!
Rainbow Dash,"You'd better let me handle this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!"
Amethyst Star,"Oh, brother."
Rainbow Dash,Ta-da!
Amethyst Star,Uh... thanks.
Rainbow Dash,How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing?
Amethyst Star,Aren't you milking this a bit?
Rainbow Dash,"Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing?"
Amethyst Star,"Oh, you're amazing alright. An amazingly<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, look!"
Rainbow Dash,Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass!
Others,"""Pine Breeze"": From what?"
Rainbow Dash,From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!
Liza Doolots,Lame...
Pony,Whatever.
Rainbow Dash,"Aww, who am I kidding?"
Rainbow Dash,"All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that! What about me? How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves. Nope, I'm still awesome. They're wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone."
Scootaloo,"Hey, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,"I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake."
Scootaloo,Mistake? What mistake?
Rainbow Dash,Wait a minute. Why are you here?
Scootaloo,"To invite you to join us! We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare Do Well."
Rainbow Dash,No! No way! Can't you see I-I wanna be alone? I love being alone.
Scootaloo,"Oh, okay. See you later then."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her. [mockingly] Thank you, Mare Do Well, whoever you are, for ruining e<U+0096> [normal] Hey, squirt! Wait up!"
Mayor Mare,"Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero, the mysterious Mare Do Well!"
Rainbow Dash,"The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?"
Rainbow Dash,So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!
Rainbow Dash,What the hay?
Rainbow Dash,"Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved! [yelps] P-p-p-p- Pinkie?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were three of you?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times."
Applejack,"I stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee."
Cherry Berry,Sorry!
Pinkie Pie,It's alright.
Twilight Sparkle,And I used my magic to fix the dam.
Fluttershy,"Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards."
Rarity,I made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself!
Rainbow Dash,I don't understand. Why? Don't you want me to be a hero?
Twilight Sparkle,Of course we want you to be a hero.
Applejack,But a real hero doesn't brag.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little."
Other main cast,A little?!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, a lot."
Twilight Sparkle,Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...
Applejack,...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.
Applejack,I think we're getting off topic here.
Twilight Sparkle,"What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility."
Rainbow Dash,Ohhhh. That makes loads more sense. Yeah. You're right. And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me. Like Mare Do Well.
Twilight Sparkle,Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.
Spike,"Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess."
Rainbow Dash,"That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself."
Spike,"Aww, come on, I wrote the whole thing already!"
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, let's hear it."
Spike,[clears throat] Dear Princess Cel-
Rainbow Dash,Look out! It's a real ghost!
Rarity,[gasp] Here? I get to stay here?
Princess Celestia,"Twilight Sparkle said you were coming to Canterlot for a visit, and asked if I might accommodate you."
Rarity,"Thank you so much, Princess."
Princess Celestia,You're very welcome.
Rarity,"No, really. This is so nice of you."
Princess Celestia,"It's nothing, really."
Princess Celestia,You are very we<U+0096>
Rarity,Thank you!
Bags Valet,"[pant] Your luggage, mademoiselle?"
Princess Celestia,I'll leave you to get settled.
Bags Valet,Your highness.
Princess Celestia,Enjoy your stay.
Rarity,Thank you!
Bags Valet,[straining] Where would you like me to put these?
Rarity,That's perfect.
Jet Set,"Please excuse our interruption. I'm Jet Set, and this is my wife Upper Crust. We saw you from across the cafe and just had to find out..."
Upper Crust,...Where did you get that simply marvelous chapeau?
Rarity,"Oh, this old thing? Oh, it's just something I<U+0096>"
Hayseed Turnip Truck,"Rarity! Hey, Rarity! Whoo! It's me, Hayseed Turnip Truck! We met at the big hoedown in Ponyville last month?"
Rarity,"Oh, yes, of course... how are you?"
Hayseed Turnip Truck,Good! Real good!
Jet Set and Upper Crust,Hmm...
Jet Set,You're from... Ponyville?
Rarity,"Well, yeah, yes, but<U+0096>"
Hayseed Turnip Truck,She sure is! She's a real big-time fancy pants dressmaker there! Probably made that real purty thing she's got on her head!
Upper Crust,I thought it looked a little country.
Jet Set,"I told you it wasn't something you could get here in Canterlot, dear."
Jet Set and Upper Crust,Hmph!
Hayseed Turnip Truck,"Well, they seemed real nice."
Rarity,"""Looked a little country"". ""Not something you can get in Canterlot"". I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot!"
Rarity,"[panting] I have to get started right away. This new design is very ambitious, and I've already written to Twilight to let her know she'll have something beyond fabulous to wear to her party. [gasps] Fancy Pants!"
Fancy Pants,"I say, that's one way to make an introduction."
Rarity,"Oh, goodness, I am so sorry. I didn't see you there. I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and<U+0096>"
Fancy Pants,You're staying at the castle?
Rarity,Wh<U+0096> The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.
Fancy Pants,You know the Princess?
Fleur de Lis,"Hmm, a pony with expensive tastes, I see."
Rarity,"Oh, it's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend. Her birthday is in a few days. [pants] Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you."
Fancy Pants,"I'm not! Heheh, you are obviously somepony worth bumping into! Listen, I have a VIP box reserved at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon. Would you, would you be so kind as to join me and a few of my companions there?"
Rarity,Me?
Fancy Pants,"But of course, my dear."
Rarity,"Well, I'm, uh, ah- no- sure."
Fancy Pants,"We'd love to see you there, uh...?"
Rarity,Rarity.
Fancy Pants,Rarity.
Rarity,"Pardon me. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me!"
Fancy Pants,"Rarity, jolly good to see you! So glad you could make it."
Fancy Pants,"Everypony, this is Rarity. She's staying at Canterlot Castle."
Announcer,"Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the Wonderbolts Derby! The competitors are taking their places at the starting line, and the race will begin momentarily!"
Fancy Pants,"I'll be rooting for Rapidfire, of course. He's sure to take home the grand prize."
Rarity,I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot.
Announcer,And it's Fleetfoot by a nose!
Fancy Pants,"Bravo, Rarity! I say, how did you know Fleetfoot would be victorious?"
Rarity,"My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time. She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed."
Silver Frames,And who is this 'Rainbow Dash'?
Rarity,"Uh... [gulps] Why... she's... she's the... the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course."
Fancy Pants,"Staying at Canterlot Castle, and she knows the Pegasus training the Wonderbolts. I told you all this was an important pony."
Fancy Pants,"Three cheers for Rarity, my new favorite party guest!"
Ponies,"Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!"
Rarity,"...And then I said, ""Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!"""
Rarity,"Oh, I'd love to, but I<U+0096>"
Golden Gavel,And let's not forget my charity auction tomorrow morning.
Rarity,"Well, that sounds wonderful, but I<U+0096>"
Swan Song,And of course there's a seat for you at my dinner party tomorrow night.
Rarity,"I'm flattered, really. It's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and-"
Silver Frames,"Oh, but Rarity! I may as well close down the whole gallery if you can't attend!"
Golden Gavel,"My auction is for charity, dear. For charity..."
Swan Song,And my dinner party will be a disaster if you don't come.
Rarity,...of course I'll be there.
Silver Frames,Wonderful!
Golden Gavel,"Oh, thank goodness!"
Swan Song,Disaster averted!
Rarity,"Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence. Turns out bumping into Fancy Pants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I?"
Rarity,"I'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know I'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know"
Others,"Becoming as popular as popular can be Making my mark, making my mark in high society I'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know"
Others,"See how they hang on every word that I speak My approving glance is what they all seek I'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe I'm the type of pony every pony should know"
Others,"At home, at the opera, on a fancy yacht Becoming the talk, the talk of all of Canterlot I'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe, yeah I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know"
Others,"Because I'm the type of pony Yes, I'm the type of pony Yes, I'm the type of pony every pony should know"
Rarity,"Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything."
Bags Valet,Me... too...
Rarity,We'd better get going.
Rarity,I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensemble.
Rarity,"For me? Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon. Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust! [gasps] The Canterlot garden party! Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is the premier event in Canterlot! [squeals] Oh, but if I go, I'll miss Twilight's birthday... But if I don't go, my new reputation in Canterlot as a Very Important Pony might be ruined! I might never be invited to another high society event again! Friend's birthday... Very Important Pony... [winces] It's just too important. [takes deep breath] My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because... because poor Opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville! I do hope you understand. Your friend, Rarity."
Bags Valet,I suppose this means you don't need me to bring down your bags?
Rarity,"No. But, I will need some help unpacking them."
Bags Valet,Oomph!
Rarity,"What do you think? Too much? You're right. Too little. Ah, garden party, here I come!"
Rest of main cast,Surprise!
Pinkie Pie,"[fades in] Swoosh! And right before she hit the ground, shoom, she<U+0096> Hi again!"
Rarity,What are you<U+0096> how did you<U+0096> Why are you<U+0096>
Applejack,"Listen to her. She's so excited to see us, she can hardly talk."
Rarity,"What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here?"
Twilight Sparkle,"When I got your letter saying you were stuck in Canterlot, I asked Pinkie Pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here, so you wouldn't have to miss it!"
Pinkie Pie,Balloons are super easy to pack.
Rarity,"Wow... First you get me a suite at Canterlot Castle and now this. I don't know what to say, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash,How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?
Fluttershy,"Oh, poor Opal. Where is the sick darling?"
Rarity,"Oh, uhh, she's... Hold on a minute."
Rest of main cast,Huh?
Rarity,I am so sorry about this.
Rarity,She's resting on the bed.
Fluttershy,Poor baby.
Fluttershy,She looks awful.
Twilight Sparkle,Is... that my dress?
Rarity,Yes.
Twilight Sparkle,It's so... simple. So practical. So me! It's the perfect dress for my birthday party! I love it!
Rarity,[sighs in relief] You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.
Twilight Sparkle,"When I told the Princess that I was moving the party to Canterlot, she was kind enough to offer us the Canterlot Castle ballroom!"
Pinkie Pie,Isn't it fancy pants?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, I never leave home without my party cannon!"
Pinkie Pie,Ta-da!
Twilight Sparkle,"I thought about having my birthday outside, but they're having another party on the castle grounds today."
Pinkie Pie,Let's party!
Rarity,Mmh... No reason I can't at least make an appearance...
Rarity,I'm here!
Upper Crust,"Darling, I'm so glad you made it."
Fancy Pants,Rarity! So happy to see you here.
Rarity,I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
Fancy Pants,"[sniffs] I say, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells like... [sniffs] Is that cake frosting?"
Rarity,"...Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out. [laughs nervously] After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?"
Fancy Pants,I know I do.
Upper Crust,Mm-hmm.
Rarity,"[sighs] Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry. Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table. If you'll excuse me..."
Rarity,I think I left the bathwater running in my suite.
Rarity,I really should go check on Opal...
Rarity,Is that Princess Celestia?
Rarity,[hushed] I need to use the little fillies' room!
Rarity,Can I get anypony more punch?
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, what's with the croquet mallet?"
Rarity,[muffled] What croquet mallet?
Rainbow Dash,"Duh, the one in your mouth!"
Rarity,"[laughs nervously] Ooh, that croquet mallet. I- well I, you know, the truth is... the truth is..."
Twilight Sparkle,Were you at that other party in the garden?
Rarity,"I, I..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, I'm surprised at you."
Rarity,Twilight let me explain! I<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,I hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony!
Rarity,You must understand! I<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,"All of those ponies look so posh. And with the Grand Galloping Gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses. Very smart!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, well, you didn't have to do that. You should totally go over there and mingle!"
Rarity,"Twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for. I don't know why I ever thought you wouldn't understand."
Twilight Sparkle,Understand what?
Rarity,Nothing. See you girls later!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, wait up! We're your friends! I'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too! C'mon, you guys! Let's show them how to party Ponyville style!"
Rarity,Oh no!
Pinkie Pie,Mmm!
Applejack,"How come y'all aren't doing any gardening? This is a garden party, isn't it?"
Jet Set,Can you believe what that pony is wearing?
Upper Crust,It's just so plain.
Rarity,[nervous laugh] Yeah.
Fancy Pants,"Excuse me, might I ask where you got your ensemble?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Why, yes! Yes, you may. A very, very close friend of mine from Ponyville made it for me."
Fancy Pants,Ponyville? You don't say?
Twilight Sparkle,I do say. Her name is<U+0096>
Rarity,"Fancy Pants! Come with me! I'd like to show you this, er, thing that's over there. On the other side of the room."
Fancy Pants,"In a moment, my dear. This lovely filly from Ponyville was just about to tell me who made her charming dress."
Rarity,"That dress? Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, don't be so modest! This dress you made is beautiful!"
Twilight Sparkle,We all think so!
Fancy Pants,[to Rarity] You know these ponies?
Rarity,"Yes. Yes, I do know them. They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends. And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know."
Jet Set,Important ponies? These ruffians?
Upper Crust,Don't make me laugh!
Fancy Pants,"I, for one, find them charmingly rustic."
Fancy Pants,And I think the dress you made for your friend is lovely. [chuckle] I dare say every mare in Canterlot will be wanting one.
Upper Crust,"Oh, I'd like to place my order right now."
Jet Set,I think you should get two.
Fancy Pants,"Er, yes, now then. How about you introduce me to your friends?"
Rarity,With pleasure!
Rarity,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Rarity,I wanted to tell you about the important lesson I learned during my visit.
Princess Celestia,Now that I would like to hear.
Rarity,"I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what."
Princess Celestia,"Hm, a very valuable lesson to have learned."
Bags Valet,It certainly is! But... might I ask that we hurry things up a bit?! Oh no!
Twilight Sparkle,"No distractions. Today is too important. Re-shelving day! Understanding Medieval Equestria goes in Pony History. Modern Spellcasting. That's Classics. The Art of the To-Do List... Actually, I kinda wanna read that again."
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! What are you laughing at?
Spike,"This little beauty is my birthday present to myself! It's a fire ruby! I've been aging it for months, and it's almost ripe!"
Spike,"[giggles] Hey, you took my advice! Just use the whole floor as one big shelf."
Rarity,"[muffled] Hellooo? [normal] Anypony home? Twilight? [gasps] Is that a fire ruby?! Huh, that must be at least twenty carats! No inclusions, pristine facets..."
Spike,And totally delicious.
Twilight Sparkle,Uhh... if you guys don't mind?
Rarity,"Oh, uh, of course. I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion... [to Spike] Did you say... delicious?"
Spike,"Sure did! Next week's my birthday, and this is my birthday dinner."
Twilight Sparkle,Start with this one.
Rarity,"Thanks, Twilight. I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game... [to Spike] I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike. I've never seen anything quite so stunning before."
Spike,"Gosh... You really like it, huh?"
Rarity,Like it? It's magnificent.
Spike,[sighs] Then you should have it. This beautiful gem was meant to be with you.
Rarity,"I don't know what to say... This is so thoughtful. Oh, my little Spikey-wikey! [kisses] Thank you so much!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done. I've never seen Rarity so happy!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Just about finished, Spike? Everypony will be here soon."
Spike,There. Perfect! Everything looks perfect!
Twilight Sparkle,Not quite everything.
Spike,"A washcloth? I don't get it. Ah, no way, Twilight! I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek that Rarity kissed, and I meant it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"It's over, Spike! I'm cleaning that cheek!"
Spike,[gasps for breath] It's mine! Stop it!
Twilight Sparkle,Never!
Spike,Twilight...!
Pinkie Pie,[blows party hooter] Happy birthday!
Pinkie Pie,"Party time, woo-hoo!"
Spike,Are those... for me?
Applejack,"You bet they are, birthday boy."
Fluttershy,"Happy birthday, Spike."
Rainbow Dash,Don't you know you get presents on your birthday?
Spike,"Well, actually, this is my first birthday in Ponyville... I usually just get one present... from Twilight. A book."
Rarity,"Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes. I'm going to make one for each of you!"
Rarity,"I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced. Mmm."
Spike,"Applejack, I can't thank you enough for this great blanket. I really needed a new one."
Applejack,"C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times. I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed."
Spike,"I know I keep thanking you guys, but I'm just so grateful. I wish this party could last forever."
Pinkie Pie,"Duh! The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner, 'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!"
Spike,No way!
Pinkie Pie,"I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!"
Spike,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Cake!"
Mr. Cake,"Mr. There's the dragon of the hour! Happy birthday, Spike!"
Spike,Thanks!
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. When we found out it was your birthday, we couldn't resist trying out a new recipe: sapphire!"
Spike,Wow!
Spike,"Thank you so much! Man, first I get a bunch of great presents from my best friends, and now an amazing sapphire cupcake! Hohoh, what a day! Whoa! Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Cheerilee!"
Cheerilee,That's okay. What's got you so excited?
Spike,"[chomps] [muffled] Pinkie Pie told me I should come see the Cakes, so they could give me a cake 'cause it's my birthday today."
Cheerilee,"Well, happy birthday, Spike! I wish I had something to give you! Uh... Oh! Here you go!"
Spike,"Wow, really?"
Cheerilee,"Sure! Everypony should get fun gifts on their birthday! Have a great birthday, Spike."
Spike,I wish every day was my birthday...
Spike,"Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday to the Cakes, and I get a cupcake. I mention it to Cheerilee, and I get this great hat."
Spike,"Hmmm, I wonder... Hey there, Lickety Split! That's a pretty cool ball you got there! Did you know it's my birthday?"
Spike,"[laughs] This is unbelievable! [chuckles] Hey, Junebug! It's my birthday!"
Junebug,"Happy birthday, Spike."
Spike,"Aren't you gonna give me something? You know, like a birthday present?"
Junebug,"Um, I... I don't have anything."
Spike,"Well, how about those flowers? I'll take those<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike! Uh, sorry, Junebug, I think Spike might've gotten a little carried away."
Junebug,"Uh, no problem... H-Happy birthday, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle,What are you doing? You're out here demanding gifts now?
Spike,"Wow, you're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. Thanks for snapping me out of it. I'd better go give Cheerilee her hat back."
Twilight Sparkle,No problem. See you at home later?
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, what a rough night's sleep, Spike. I had the weirdest drea<U+0096>"
Spike,[yawns/hisses] What happened?
Spike,"What's happening to me, Twilight?!"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know! Think back to last night. Did something happen? Spike? What did you do after I saw you?
Spike,I went to talk... to...
Twilight Sparkle,Spike!
Spike,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,You went to talk to who?
Spike,"Oh, um... I don't remember. Hey, can I have that globe? You're not using it, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Spike,What about this book?
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, I'm worried about you. You're usually not so... grabby!"
Spike,My arms aren't usually [voice drops] this long either. What's happening to me?
Dr. Horse,"Dr. Well now, what seems to be the problem?"
Twilight Sparkle,This is Spike. [slaps] And something's wrong with him. [slaps] He used to be half this size! And he keeps trying to take things that aren't [slaps] his!
Dr. Horse,"Dr. All right then, let's just have a look see, shall we? Widdle guy not feewing too good? Who's a brave widdle boy, huh? Who's a brave one?"
Twilight Sparkle,"So? What do you think, Doctor?"
Dr. Horse,"Dr. Well, I think I know what the problem is. He's a dragon!"
Twilight Sparkle,That's not the problem. He's always been a dragon.
Dr. Horse,"Dr. Oh. Well, that would explain it. Listen, I don't know anything about dragons, I know about baby ponies. Maybe you should try a vet."
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Okay. Thank you, doctor."
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. Hm, well, I'm flummoxed. Y'bring me a dog, I've got it diagnosed in seconds. Snake even faster, but... to be honest, I've never seen a real live dragon before."
Dr. Fauna,Dr. Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Sit.
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks anyway. C'mon, Spike."
Zecora,"Ooh, he is starting to mature. Of this fact I am quite sure."
Twilight Sparkle,Mature? So he's just... growing up? But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.
Zecora,"A dragon's heart is prone to greed, a steady diet to make growth speed. Then, the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise. If this trait should go unchecked, if Spike continues to collect, more growth will certainly occur <U+0096> he is going to turn into a monster."
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] You mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets? But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?"
Zecora,"If his monstrous ways you wish to impede, you must prevent him from practicing greed."
Apple Bloom,"Get away from her, you brute!"
Spike,Spike want!
Scootaloo,You're not getting my scooter!
Spike,Spike want!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Spike! Check out this amazing broom!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[sing-song voice] C'mon, big boy! Look at this incredible broom!"
Spike,Spike want!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fight all you want, I'm not letting you out! Oh, Spike, I just re-shelved this room!"
Twilight Sparkle,[groans] What now?
Applejack,"Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my leaves?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, help! Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him!"
Applejack,"[laughs] Oh, that's a good one, Twilight. Sweet little Spike, running wild. Ha, what a laugh."
Applejack,"Twilight, get my rope."
Applejack and Twilight Sparkle,Help!
Rainbow Dash,Huh? [laughs] Don't tell me! You-you tied yourselves up?
Applejack,Get us out of here right now!
Applejack,[gasps] What was that?
Rainbow Dash,Sounded like Fluttershy to me!
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy? Fluttershy!?
Fluttershy,I'm up here!
Twilight Sparkle,What happened?
Fluttershy,"I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, r-rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!"
Twilight Sparkle,That was Spike!
Fluttershy,Spike? But why would Spike steal my chicken coop? He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!
Rainbow Dash,That sounded like Pinkie Pie!
Twilight Sparkle,"C'mon, girls!"
Pinkie Pie,Back! Get back!
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!
Pinkie Pie,"I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake!"
Pinkie Pie,How dare you take the cake!
Twilight Sparkle,He's completely out of control! Who knows where he'll go next!
Rarity,"Put me down, you brute!"
Rarity,How rude.
Fluttershy,"Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you!"
Rainbow Dash,"Put her down, right now!"
Fluttershy,"I-If you wouldn't mind, that is..."
Rainbow Dash,"I mean it, dragon boy!"
Fluttershy,We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider...
Rainbow Dash,"Drop her, scaly!"
Rarity,Hey! I'm<U+0096> not some<U+0096> sort of common<U+0096> fly swatter!
Rarity,Girls! My cape!
Rainbow Dash,Look! The Wonderbolts!
Rarity,"Oh, be quiet. You've got nothing to be proud of. You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends! Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all. But this! [rips off dress] This is a crime against fashion! Oh no. You are not getting this gemstone! This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey, the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!"
Others,"Spike (flashback): Here, Rarity, you take it. It would mean even more to see you happy than to eat it myself."
Rarity,"Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be eating me or something? Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?!"
Pinkie Pie,Somepony do something!
Rainbow Dash,On it!
Spike,Rarity? I need to tell you something! Just in case we don't make it! I've always sort of had a crush<U+0096>
Fluttershy,[gasps] We did it! I can't believe we did it!
Rainbow Dash,All in a day's work.
Rarity,"Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you."
Spike,Proud of me?
Spike,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Spike,"Today I learned a great lesson about friendship. Well, you might think that it would feel good to get lots and lots of stuff, but it doesn't feel nearly as good as giving something special to somepony you really care about. But I learned that it truly is better to give than to receive, and that kindness and generosity are what lead to true friendship. And that's more valuable than anything in the world. Well... almost anything."
Twilight Sparkle,We're getting closer!
Rainbow Dash,I can hardly wait!
Fluttershy,"I'm so excited, I-I feel like shouting! [softly] Woo-hoo!"
Applejack,"Hooo-wee! Canterlot, here we come!"
Rarity,"Oh, I do hope I look festive enough!"
Pinkie Pie,There it is! Canterlot!
Main cast,Oooh...
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful this time of year?"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I wish it was Hearth's Warming Eve every day."
Applejack,There's so much to look at! I feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head!
Twilight Sparkle,"I have an idea, let's play 'I spy with my little eye' as we walk! I'll go first. I spy... an eight-foot candy cane."
Rainbow Dash,I spy a snowpony!
Pinkie Pie,I spy somepony eating a gingerbread house...
Pinkie Pie,[munching] ...and it's me!
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe that Princess Celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season! Do you guys know what an honor this is? For all of us?
Fluttershy,"Oh, I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... I can't go onstage! I don't want everypony looking at me!"
Rarity,"Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about."
Fluttershy,No?
Rarity,"Of course not. All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve in their own towns. It's tradition."
Fluttershy,So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?
Rarity,"Well, no. We're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria. A lot of ponies will come to watch us."
Fluttershy,A lot?
Rarity,Hundreds.
Fluttershy,Hundreds?
Rarity,[gasps] Maybe even thousands!
Rarity,"Oh, my hair! Applejack? Be a dear and shut those windows, will you?"
Rainbow Dash,"Aaah! Rain-bow-Dash! Rain-bow-Dash! Aaaah! Thank you, thank you!"
Applejack,It's a reenactment of the founding of Equestria. It's not the 'Rainbow Dash Show'.
Rainbow Dash,Well it should be the 'Rainbow Dash Show'! I'm the star!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, you've got to come out of there!"
Spike,Curtain in two minutes!
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, let me handle this."
Rarity,My hair!
Twilight Sparkle,PINKIE!
Applejack,The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant is about harmony and friendship.
Other main cast,Shut the window!
Spike,"[with a faux British accent] Once upon a time, long before the peaceful rule of Celestia, and before ponies discovered our beautiful land of Equestria, ponies did not know harmony. It was a strange and dark time. A time when ponies were torn apart... by hatred!"
Spike,"[normal voice] I know. Can you believe it? [accent] During this frightful age, each of the three tribes <U+0096> the Pegasi, the unicorns, and the Earth ponies <U+0096> cared not for what befell the other tribes, but only for their own welfare. In those troubled times, as now, the Pegasi were the stewards of the weather. But they demanded something in return. Food that could only be grown by the Earth ponies."
Spike,"The unicorns demanded the same, in return for magically bringing forth day and night. And so, mistrust between the tribes festered, until one fateful day, it came to a boil. And what prompted the ponies to clash? 'Twas a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land, and toppled the tribes' precarious peace."
Spike,The normally industrious Earth ponies were unable to farm their land.
Spike,"The Earth ponies were freezing. The home of the Pegasi fared no better. The Pegasi were hungry. And the unicorns were freezing and hungry. Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm. Each tribe blamed the others for their suffering, and the angrier everypony grew, the worse the blizzard became. And so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard."
Spike,Each tribe sent their leaders.
Spike,"Daughter of the unicorn king, Princess Platinum."
Spike,"Ruler of the Pegasi, Commander Hurricane. And lastly..."
Spike,"...leader of the Earth ponies, Chancellor Puddinghead. Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences, and agree on a way to get through this disaster."
Rainbow Dash,All I wanna know is why the Earth ponies are hogging all the food!
Pinkie Pie,"Us?! We're not hogging all the food, you are! Oh, wait. You're right. It's us. Well, it's only 'cause you mean old Pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy!"
Rainbow Dash,"For the hundredth time, it's not us! We're not making it snow! It must be the unicorns! They're doing it with their freaky magic!"
Rarity,"[gasps] How dare you! Unlike you Pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing! H-m-ph!"
Unicorns,Hmph!
Pinkie Pie,"Well, if you non-Earths aren't gonna stop using your weirdo powers to freeze us all, then I'm just plum out of ideas."
Rainbow Dash,What a shocker. An Earth pony with no ideas.
Rarity,"Commander Hurricane, please cease with the insults!"
Rainbow Dash,"You're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness!"
Rarity,I beg your pardon?! I am a princess! I won't be spoken to that way!
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I'm leaving first!"
Pinkie Pie,"No, I'm first!"
Spike,And the blizzard raged on.
Spike,"So the summit of the tribes did not turn out as well as hoped, and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds, and basically complain."
Rainbow Dash,Atten-tion! Well? Aren't you curious about how it went?
Fluttershy,"Oh! Commander Hurricane, sir! How did it go, sir?"
Rainbow Dash,"Horribly! Those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful! Don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed? We have got to break ranks with those weak foals!"
Rarity,[shivering] Clover the Clever! I need you!
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, your Majesty. Did the other pony tribes see reason as I predicted?"
Rarity,"Those other tribes are impossible! I, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures. The unicorns are noble and majestic. We will no longer consort with the likes of them!"
Applejack,"Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, Chancellor?"
Pinkie Pie,"Maybe for you, Smart Cookie. But I am a chancellor. I was elected because I know how to think outside the box. Which means [slightly echoes] I can also think inside the chimney. Can you think inside a chimney?"
Applejack,Uh...
Pinkie Pie,I didn't think so.
Applejack,Ugh.
Pinkie Pie,Ohmygosh. Hold on to your hooves! I am just about to be brilliant!
Applejack,[under her breath] That'd be a first.
Pinkie Pie,I have decided that the Earth ponies are gonna go it alone!
Applejack,"Aw, so you mean the other tribes didn't come around? Shoot... I really thought we could get through to 'em if we<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"Don't worry about them. We're the ones with all the food, right?"
Applejack,"Actually, we're all out."
Pinkie Pie,"Fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food. And with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong?"
Applejack,[under her breath] Where should I start?
Pinkie Pie,The point is...
Others,"Pinkie Pie, We must find a new land!"
Rainbow Dash,"C'mon, Private Pansy, let's get a move on! Hup-one, hup-two!"
Rainbow Dash,"Get a hold of yourself, Private! We cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand. To find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land!"
Fluttershy,"Conquer, sir?"
Rainbow Dash,You never know where enemies might be lurking.
Fluttershy,"I don't see any enemies, Commander. Just... snow."
Rainbow Dash,Okay. This is getting old.
Rarity,"Oh, this is simply taking forever. My hooves are killing me! How long have we been walking for?"
Twilight Sparkle,"About five minutes, your highness."
Rarity,"Oh, I never imagined finding a new land would be so hard. But it'll all be worth it, don't you agree?"
Twilight Sparkle,I actually think that the three tribes could've tried harder.
Rarity,Stoooooop!
Twilight Sparkle,What's wrong?
Rarity,That is what's wrong!
Twilight Sparkle,"Your Highness, it's just a stream. We can cross it easily."
Rarity,"I refuse to get my gown wet. I have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled Earth pony, or worse yet a rough-and-tumble Pegasus. I, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level. On the other hand, I have no trouble watching you stoop down."
Rarity,"And do watch the gown, darling. It's worth more than all of the books in your library."
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, yes. This is definitely the right direction."
Applejack,It feels like we're going in circles.
Pinkie Pie,But that's impossible. Are you suggesting that I'm reading the map wrong?
Applejack,"Absolutely not, your chancellorness. It's just that there are holes in the map, and<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,Of course! How else could I see where I was going?
Applejack,"Yeah, uh<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"Or talk? I need to be able to talk! I mean, how would we survive if I just suddenly shut up?"
Applejack,"Heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship. Heh. It's just that... the map is also upside down."
Pinkie Pie,"I got a newsflash for you, Cookie. The Earth is round. There is no up or down."
Applejack,You're right! It's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map...
Pinkie Pie,"Relief? You don't need relief! If anypony needs relief around here, it's me! I'm a chancellor! I'm a bigshot! You're just my, um... my, uh..."
Applejack,Secretary.
Pinkie Pie,"Whatever. You take the map, while I enjoy some relief."
Applejack,"Yes, Chancellor Puddinghead."
Spike,"[accent] And so, each leader encountered obstacles along the way, but eventually, they all arrived in a new and wondrous land. Nopony had ever seen paradise before."
Rainbow Dash,This is the new land we've been searching for!
Fluttershy,What a view... I can see my future house from here.
Rainbow Dash,I proclaim this new land to be... Pegasopolis!
Rarity,"I've never seen such jewels! This ruby is dazzling. This whole land is dazzling. I'm double dazzled! [squeals] In the name of the unicorns, I hereby dub this land Unicornia!"
Pinkie Pie,The air! The trees! The dirt! This dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world!
Applejack,"And fertile, too. Perfect for growing food."
Pinkie Pie,"In the name of the Earth ponies, I think I'm gonna call this new place... uh... Dirtville."
Applejack,"How about ""Earth""?"
Pinkie Pie,Earth! Congratulations to me for thinking of it.
Others,"Pinkie Pie, We found our new home!"
Rainbow Dash,I planted my flag first!
Rarity,Did not!
Rainbow Dash,Did too!
Pinkie Pie,I planted mine earlier than first.
Rarity,All of you riffraff are trespassing in Unicornia!
Rainbow Dash,The name is Pegasopolis!
Pinkie Pie,Earth!
Rainbow Dash,Pegasopolis!
Rarity,Unicornia!
Rainbow Dash,I say we fight for the land. May the best pony win!
Rarity,That's barbaric. Clover the Clever? Throw that brute into the dungeon!
Twilight Sparkle,"What dungeon? Look, perhaps if we all calmed down..."
Applejack,I agree. Let's all calm down.
Fluttershy,I vote for calm.
Rainbow Dash,"I'll have you court-martialed for insubordination, Private! We settle this on the battlefield!"
Rarity,Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!
Pinkie Pie,"Wait a minute, where'd all this snow come from anyway?"
Rainbow Dash,Oh no. Not again.
Spike,"[accent] And so the paradise that the ponies had found was soon lost, buried beneath a thick blanket of snow and hard feelings. Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy. Instead of wonderful, it was wintry! Instead of spectacular, it was snow-tacular! Instead of<U+0096>"
Shoeshine,We get it! Move on!
Spike,"[laughs nervously] [clears throat] [accent] Everypony was forced to seek shelter. They searched high and low, but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave. And, of course, the three tribes had to share it, and nopony was too happy about that."
Rarity,"Please, Commander Hothead."
Rainbow Dash,It's Commander Hurricane.
Rarity,"[clears throat] Please, Commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space?"
Rainbow Dash,"You mean like this, your highness?"
Rarity,Indeed not! You see this invisible line?
Rainbow Dash,"Private? Outline our territory for everypony to see. See this real, non-invisible line? No unicorns or Earth ponies are allowed to cross it! This is the sovereign territory of Pegasopolis!"
Rarity,Clover the Clever?
Pinkie Pie,Uh... Smart Cookie!
Applejack,"I know, I know."
Rainbow Dash,"What are you doing? Don't go around the rock, go over it! I'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy!"
Rarity,"That rock is clearly on the Unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us! [under her breath] Who knows? there could be jewels inside."
Rainbow Dash,[groans] I claim this rock for Pegasopolis!
Rarity,"Unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, look, you found my rock. I've been looking for it everywhere."
Rainbow Dash,Hey! You invaded our territory!
Pinkie Pie,"Finders keepers, losers weepers!"
Rainbow Dash,That's the last straw!
Rarity,Give me my rock!
Twilight Sparkle,"Look, everypony! The entrance!"
Rainbow Dash,Great. Now there's no way out! We're trapped!
Rarity,You two deserve this horrible fate. You've done nothing but argue and fight with each other!
Rainbow Dash,"You've been fighting too, your Highness."
Pinkie Pie,Yeah! Worse! I haven't been fighting nearly as much as you!
Rarity,How ridiculous! A unicorn never stoops to fighting!
Rainbow Dash,That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win! Earth ponies are numbskulls!
Rarity,Pegasi are brutes!
Pinkie Pie,Unicorns are snobs!
Fluttershy,W-W-What is that... thing?
Twilight Sparkle,They must be... windigos!
Applejack and Fluttershy,Windigos?
Twilight Sparkle,"My mentor Star Swirl the Bearded taught me about them. They're winter spirits that feed off fighting and hatred. The more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become!"
Applejack,"Then... this is our fault. We three tribes... we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other. Now it's destroyin' this land, too."
Twilight Sparkle,And now our bodies will become as cold as our hearts... all because we were foolish enough to hate.
Fluttershy,"Well, I don't hate you... I actually hate Commander Hurricane a lot more than I hate you guys."
Fluttershy,"Actually, I don't really hate her, I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her."
Applejack,"Well, I don't hate you guys either."
Twilight Sparkle,Nor do I.
Applejack,"No matter what our differences, we're all ponies."
Fluttershy,What was that?
Applejack,I didn't know unicorns could do that.
Twilight Sparkle,"I didn't either. Nothing like this has ever happened before. But I know it couldn't have been just me. It came from all three of us, joined together, in friendship."
Spike,"[accent] All through the night, the three ponies kept the fire of friendship alive by telling stories to one another and by singing songs, which of course became the winter carols that we all still sing today. Eventually, the warmth of the fire and singing and laughing reached the leaders, and their bodies began to thaw. [normal voice] And it even began to melt their hearts."
Spike,"[accent] The three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land, and live in harmony ever afterwards. And together, they named their new land..."
Main cast,Equestria!
Choir,"The fire of friendship lives in our hearts As long as it burns, we cannot drift apart Though quarrels arise, their numbers are few Laughter and singing will see us through (will see us through) We are a circle of pony friends A circle of friends we'll be to the very end"
Twilight Sparkle,We should be so honored that Princess Celestia chose us! She must really think we exemplify what good friends are!
Rarity,"Applejack, I thought you closed all the windows."
Applejack,"Don't blame me. Rainbow Dash should've flown up there and shut it. After all, she's got wings."
Rainbow Dash,Why do I always have to do all the high up chores? Why can't Twilight use her magic for a change!
Rainbow Dash,Y'know what? I got it.
Granny Smith,The timberwolves are a-howlin'! The timberwolves are a-howlin'!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Granny Smith,The zap apples are comin'! The zap apples are comin'!
Others,"Applejack, Yay, the zap apples are comin'!"
Granny Smith,That's what I said.
Granny Smith,"Hey, silly goose! Quit your gawkin' and move your caboose!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"Ready, Granny!"
Granny Smith,Ready for what?
Apple Bloom,For makin' zap apple jam!
Granny Smith,Darn tootin'! It's time for some good old-fashioned zap apple jammin'!
Apple Bloom,"Yes, ma'am. I can't wait, ma'am!"
Granny Smith,[pause] Wait for what?
Apple Bloom,To make zap apple jam with you!
Granny Smith,"O'course. Now I been doin' this ever since I was a little pony, so be warned, pickle pear. There's a whole mess o' steps in this process and you gots to get each one of them just right, or no zap apple jam. Take this."
Apple Bloom,"Uh, is this one of your gazillion secret herbal ingredients for the zap apple jam?"
Granny Smith,"That there's a broom. Now get sweepin', pipsqueak! Now while you sweep, I'll get to, uh... something there... umm... Oh, ponyfeathers. Bet I'd forget my mane if it wasn't attached to my head."
Applejack,"There's the zap apple leaves, right on schedule!"
Granny Smith,"A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L-M-N-O-P..."
Granny Smith,"Well, howdy-doo there, Filthy Rich!"
Filthy Rich,"Hello, Mrs. Smith. Did I hear right that there's a zap apple harvest coming in a few days?"
Granny Smith,"Four days, to be exact."
Filthy Rich,"Excellent news, and as usual, I get your first hundred jars?"
Granny Smith,"'Course, Filthy."
Filthy Rich,"Uh, I prefer Rich."
Granny Smith,"Oh, and how is your pappy doin'?"
Diamond Tiara,"Oh, you poor, poor thing, having to make all that zap apple jam with Granny Smith."
Apple Bloom,"Actually, I been looking forward to making zap apple jam for years!"
Diamond Tiara,I'm not talking about the jam. I'm talking about Granny Smith! You must be sooo embarrassed.
Granny Smith,[muffled] Soup's on!
Apple Bloom,"Uh, what do ya mean?"
Diamond Tiara,"You know, with all her silly ways, how she forgets things, and makes you wear these ridiculous costumes?"
Apple Bloom,Granny said that the water needs<U+0096>
Diamond Tiara,Thank goodness you're here on the farm and not in town where everypony could see you. [hushed] Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
Apple Bloom,"""Silly ways""?"
Granny Smith,"Uh, thank you kindly, Filthy!"
Daisy,"Hey! You bite it, you buy it!"
Granny Smith,"Oh, isn't this just precious?"
Apple Bloom,Please stop!
Granny Smith,And it is perfect for makin' our zap apple jam!
Apple Bloom,"Shh! Stop it, Granny!"
Apple Bloom,"Granny, please! Those ponies over there are watchin' me!"
Granny Smith,"What? Are those fillies your friends? Hello, Half-pint's friends!"
Silver Spoon,"Hiii, Granny Smith! Hiii, [mockingly] Half-pint!"
Granny Smith,"What dolls. Why, when I was little, ponies didn't come that purdy."
Apple Bloom,"Are we done shopping, Granny? 'Cause I'd like to get back to the farm, fast."
Granny Smith,"All done, smellybelly. [singing] I got my honey, gooey-goo! Got my honey, gooey-ooh! Got my honey, iddley-hoo!"
Filthy Rich,"And, by capturing the whole sale market, purchasing in bulk and slashing all prices, we undermine every other gift market in town, and that's how Rich's Barnyard Bargains became the cornerstone of retail in Ponyville."
Cheerilee,"Well, thank you, Mr. Filthy<U+0097>I mean, Mr. Rich. What a wonderful day of sharing! And thank you for being a part of Family Appreciation Day! Now, uh, let's see who will be bringing in a family member for next Monday's Family Appreciation Day. Um... Oh! Apple Bloom!"
Apple Bloom,"But Miss Cheerilee. Monday is zap apple harvest day, and Applejack and Big McIntosh will be too busy to come and speak."
Cheerilee,"Well, is there anypony else in your family that could<U+0096>"
Diamond Tiara,Miss Cheerilee. Apple Bloom's Granny Smith isn't working harvest. She could come.
Apple Bloom,"Oh! But, uh, no, that wouldn't<U+0096>"
Cheerilee,"That's a splendid idea, Diamond Tiara! Apple Bloom, you shall bring in Granny Smith on Monday."
Cheerilee,"Have a great weekend, everypony!"
Apple Bloom,"Granny Smith? Come Monday, I'll be the laughin' stock of Ponyville!"
Applejack,"I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school. You know what'll happen."
Apple Bloom,"I know... After the fifth day, the zap apples disappear..."
Granny Smith,Look! The third sign! Right on time! Hot diggity!
Apple family,Wow!
Granny Smith,"Alright, you lazy daisies, move your caboose!"
Applejack,"I'm sorry, Apple Bloom, but don't you fret. Granny Smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell."
Apple Bloom,I know. That's what I'm worried about.
Apple Bloom,"I'll be embarrassed, shamed, disgraced, mortified, humiliate<U+0096>"
Scootaloo,"What are you, a dictionary?"
Sweetie Belle,Snap out of it. We're here to help you!
Scootaloo,"After all, we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders. We'll figure out a way to postpone your presentation."
Apple Bloom,But how? Ugh! All this worry is makin' me sick!
Sweetie Belle,Sick?
Scootaloo,That's it! C'mon!
Granny Smith,"Ten-hut! Now listen here, troops! Now, I don't want any whinin' or cryin' or crackin' under pressure! Do I make myself clear!?"
Granny Smith,Court-martialed!
Scootaloo,"Stay still, Apple Bloom! You have to look sick!"
Apple Bloom,"Aaah! [muffled] Hey, this is hot!"
Granny Smith,"What in the hayseed is going on in there, silly billy?"
Scootaloo,"Oh, Granny Smith! We were just about to come get you!"
Sweetie Belle,Apple Bloom's sick! Looks like she might have to stay home all week!
Granny Smith,[mumbles] Ooh! Perfect as a Piccadilly pear!
Apple Bloom,Now what?
Apple Bloom,"It's already almost sundown! Tomorrow is Sunday, and I only have one more day to figure something out!"
Sweetie Belle,Hey! Look!
Apple Bloom,That's the fourth sign!
Apple Bloom,The zap apples have appeared!
Sweetie Belle,And that gives me an idea!
Sweetie Belle,"We can't move Family Appreciation Day, so let's move harvest day instead!"
Apple Bloom,They don't look... quite ripe.
Scootaloo,Harvesting apples early never hurt an apple.
Apple Bloom,I don't know... Zap apple trees aren't like normal apple trees. They're magic.
Sweetie Belle,How different can they be?
Apple Bloom,"Well if we can't buck 'em, let's just pick 'em!"
Apple Bloom,Any other bright ideas?
Cheerilee,"Granny Smith, it's Miss Cheerilee! Apple Bloom said you wanted to speak with me?... Hello? Granny Smi<U+0096>"
Apple Bloom,[mimicking Granny Smith] Well hello there! Howdydoo!
Cheerilee,"Hi... uh... Granny Smith... is, ugh, everything okay?"
Apple Bloom,[mimicking Granny Smith] Of course it is! Why wouldn't it be?
Apple Bloom,"[mimicking Granny Smith] Oh, er, excuse me. Uh, pickles always give me the hiccups! I need to tell you that I can't make the presentation on Monday after all!"
Cheerilee,"Oh no, is that so?"
Apple Bloom,"[mimicking Granny Smith] No doubts about it! I gotta shear the flowers and water the sheep! I mean, I have to water the flowers and shear the sheep!"
Cheerilee,"Oh, well, that's too bad. We can reschedule."
Granny Smith,"E- whut- hai- where am I? Well, howdy, Miss Cheerilee! You window shopping?"
Cheerilee,Uh... no? You asked me to come here to tell me that you wouldn't be making it to Family Appreciation Day?
Granny Smith,Fiddlesticks! I wouldn't miss it for all the tea in Canterlot!
Cheerilee,But- didn't you just say...?
Granny Smith,See you Monday!
Apple Bloom,[sighs] I can't believe she woke up from her nap. She never wakes up from her nap! [muffled] I wish I could just run off and hide!
Sweetie Belle,"Well, you can't run off... but maybe somepony else can!"
Granny Smith,Yee-haw!
Applejack,The zap apple harvest has begun!
Granny Smith,And tomorrow we will be makin' up some zap apple jam!
Scootaloo,[in deeper voice] Miss Granny Smith? Telegram.
Granny Smith,"Well, bust my buttons. Uncle Apple Strudel wants me to pay him a visit."
Apple Bloom,And you can just make the 8AM train. I already packed you a bag!
Granny Smith,"Well, that was considerate."
Granny Smith,"But don't you worry, flibbertigibbet! I'll be back in time to make that jam!"
Apple Bloom,[sighs] That train ride takes all day. I'm safe. Hah.
Cheerilee,"For today's Family Appreciation Day, we are pleased to welcome Granny Smith. Um... Apple Bloom? Is Granny Smith here?"
Apple Bloom,"Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee, but she got called out of town on account of a family emergency<U+0096>"
Granny Smith,"Well, howdy, my little ponies!"
Granny Smith,"Howdy, y'all! I'm as happy as a pig in a fresh mudpile to be here!"
Apple Bloom,Whuh- what are you doing here? Did you miss the train?
Granny Smith,"Er, no, it came. And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it."
Diamond Tiara,I can't wait to hear Granny Smith's presentation. [hushed] If she can remember any of it.
Granny Smith,"Long ago, when I was a little pony, things were very different here in Ponyville, 'cause there was no Ponyville!"
Granny Smith,"[voiceover] That's right, my little ponies. Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk, back when I was a little filly. Oh, we ventured far and wide, collecting new seeds and sellin' the old. But my pa was the finest seed collector in all of Equestria. Then, one day, the Smith family found themselves in the most brilliant, most grand, most magnificent of all cities. A place called... Canterlot. Well, I bet your hooves to hindquarters I had never seen anything like it before nor since. And as if the beauty of that city wasn't enough, suddenly, she appeared. Princess Celestia, the most regal of all ponies. When lo and behold, she stopped to look at my pa's seed collection. Then Princess Celestia saw that we were plumb-tuckered and hankerin' to find our forever home. And bein' a royal Princess and all, she knew exactly the place for us to lay down our stakes. My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks. We quickly found that land near the Everfree Forest, and we built our first home. Next, we planted our first orchards. But an orchard don't grow overnight, and we were getting mighty short on food. Now mind you, we were cautioned about the forest, and we knew that it was not fit to enter."
Granny Smith,"[voiceover] But I knew there was critters livin' there. There must be somethin' to eat. It was dark and musty, and I won't lie, it was scary. But every inch was covered in plant life, and before I knew it, wasn't I standin' in front of the most incredible apple trees! I had never seen anything that bore this kind of colorful fruit! Oh I started picking apples quick as a whip!"
Granny Smith,"[voiceover] I turned, and there before me stood the timberwolves! I've never run so fast in my life. I did the only thing I could think of."
Granny Smith,"[voiceover] My pa and I planted those special apple seeds, and before our eyes they grew like wildfire. Why, we had full grown trees faster than you could say 'lickety split'. Then each year, I paid close attention to the signs of the zap apples' special harvesting times. How the weather affects the Everfree Forest, how the timberwolves howl when the zap apples first start growing, and how they zapped away if you didn't pick 'em all in one day! And the fruits of our labor were the best fruit we ever tasted. Soon enough I was mixing up batches of zap apple jam. Just like harvestin' the zap apples had its special rules, so did makin' zap apple jam. I learned that you gotta be extra friendly with the bees, otherwise their honey won't taste rightly sweet to mix in with the zap apples. Who'd'a thought that glass jars needed talkin' to? Or that zap apples like pink polka dots? But magic is as magic does. Just funny that way. Then ponies started comin' to our farm from far and wide just to get a taste of my zap apple jam. Some of them decided to stay, like Stinkin' Rich, Diamond Tiara's great grandfather. Matter of fact, the first thing he ever sold was my zap apple jam."
Granny Smith,"[voiceover] And before we knew it, we had ourselves a nice little town, bustling with all kinds of ponies. And that is how Ponyville was founded."
Granny Smith,"Oh, thank you kindly, little ponies. Oh, now now, let's settle down."
Scootaloo,"So if it weren't for you and the zap apples, Ponyville wouldn't even exist?!"
Granny Smith,"Darn tootin', little filly!"
Apple Bloom,"If it weren't for my Granny Smith, your daddy wouldn't have Barnyard Bargains."
Diamond Tiara,But<U+0096>
Diamond Tiara,But she's just a... kooky old lady!
Apple Bloom,She is not a kooky old lady! She is the most amazing pony in all of Ponyville!
Scootaloo,I think this is the best zap apple jam I've tasted yet!
Sweetie Belle,"Must be 'cause you had something to do with it, Apple Bloom."
Granny Smith,You betcha. Apple Bloom is one humdinger of a zap apple jammer!
Apple Bloom,I am?
Applejack,So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?
Apple Bloom,Did it? My Granny Smith is super special! I just forgot that for a little while.
Granny Smith,"Aw, don't fret. I forget things all the time. Now, I'll getcha... er... somethin'. Aw."
Applejack,Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?
Foals,"We do, we do!"
Filthy Rich,Diamond Tiara?
Diamond Tiara,But dad!
Applejack,Can you believe the new baby is finally here?
Twilight Sparkle,Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!
Rarity,I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?
Pinkie Pie,I wanna see the new baby pony! I wanna see! Which one is it?!
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Meet our son, Pound Cake."
Main cast,Awwww.
Mr. Cake,"Mr. ...and our daughter, Pumpkin Cake."
Main cast,Huh?
Pinkie Pie,"Two new foals for me to play with? [gasps] That's two, two, two times the fun! This is the greatest day ever! We need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today! Woo-hoo!"
Nurse Redheart,Shhh. The babies are trying to sleep.
Pinkie Pie,But I was just<U+0096>
Nurse Redheart,Shhh.
Pinkie Pie,But<U+0096>
Nurse Redheart,Shhh!
Pinkie Pie,[quieter] Happy happy birthday to you and you today<U+0096>
Applejack,Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a Pegasus and the other one a unicorn?
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Easy. My great-great-great-great grandfather was a unicorn, and Cup Cake's great aunt's second cousin twice removed was a Pegasus. That makes sense, right?"
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, yeah! Heh, just you wait! Once little Pound Cake there gets his wings going, he'll be all over the place."
Twilight Sparkle,And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.
Rarity,Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.
Pinkie Pie,"Quick! Make a wish and blow out your candles! Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles! You are zero years old, after all!"
Nurse Redheart,Shhh!
Pinkie Pie,"Happy month-i-versary to you and you today! [very quickly] I-can't-believe-you're-already-a-month-old. Time-sure-flies-doesn't-it-wow. Seems-like-only yesterday-you-were-born. But now you're a month old today, hey!"
Pinkie Pie,Are you ready for your favoritest game in the whole wide world? Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am!
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. Everything okay in there? Who needs a diaper change?
Pinkie Pie,"Don't worry, they're fine! [sniffs] Oogh, I mean..."
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Oh, I got it."
Mr. Cake,Mr. Is anypony hungry?
Pinkie Pie,"Ah, no thanks. I just had a big breakfast."
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. I'm on it.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, oh, you're making funny faces! I have one! Bleghhh!"
Mr. Cake,"Mr. [chuckles] No, y'see, Pinkie, the babies need to be burped."
Pinkie Pie,"All set now? Everything good? Okay, who wants to play again?"
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Uh uh uh, Pound Cake, no pounding things."
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Uh uh uh uh, we don't chew on things, Pumpkin Cake."
Pinkie Pie,Except food.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. [gasps] Food! Great cinnamon sticks, I completely forgot."
Pinkie Pie,"No, you just fed them bottles, remember?"
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. Not the babies' food!
Mr. Cake,Mr. Gh! The food for the enormously big catering order we have to deliver today!
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, with the new twins, we've been so distracted!"
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Gh, quick, honeybun, we need to find a babysitter to watch the foals while we take care of this."
Pinkie Pie,"I could do it! I wanna do it! Oh, the babies love playing with me, I'll do it!"
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. I wonder who would be available on such short notice.
Pinkie Pie,Me! Me! Pick me!
Fluttershy,"Oh, I would love to babysit! But I can't today, sorry. I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic. You understand, don't you? Y-you're not mad at me, are you? Please don't be mad at me!"
Pinkie Pie,I'll do it! Pick me!
Twilight Sparkle,I have to finish this report for the Princess summarizing all my other reports to the Princess.
Pinkie Pie,I wanna babysit! Pick me!
Applejack,Babysit? Now? When there's a swarm o' hungry caterpillars headin' this way? I gotta get all these apples picked before they get swarmed on!
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, ooh, I wanna do it!"
Rainbow Dash,I got tickets to the Wonderbolts airshow this afternoon. Gotta dash!
Pinkie Pie,Ask me! Mememememememememememememe!
Rarity,Moi? Babysit? N- Oh nonononononononono! I'm flattered that you would think about me though.
Mr. Cake,"Mr. [groans] [unenthusiastically] Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us?"
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] I dunno. I'll have to check my schedule.
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand the responsibility of watching over two babies?"
Pinkie Pie,"I can be responsible. Why, responsibility is my middle name. Pinkie Responsibility Pie."
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. But this time you need to take care of them, not just play with them. You have to be responsible."
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, I know. I will. I am."
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, here you are, dearie. All your responsibilities are on this list."
Pinkie Pie,Whoa! That's a lot of responsi<U+0096> Consider it done.
Mr. Cake,"Mr. [to Mrs. Cake] We'll frost it when we get there! C'mon, sugarplum, tick-tick!"
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. Take good care of our two precious little ginger snaps!
Pinkie Pie,"No problemo, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Everything is under control."
Pinkie Pie,Uh-oh.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, don't cry, little friends! Look, look! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Where's Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh no... I'm right here, see?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, think think think... Aha!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hey guys, watch this!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight! Where y'all from? Wow, that's great. Y'know, I used to have an ant farm, but I had to get rid of it because... I couldn't find tractors that small!"
Pinkie Pie,"Get it? Tractors that small? [pause] The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog... and now I can't find him!"
Pinkie Pie,"Gee, tough crowd. [to herself] Tell me about it. Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!"
Pinkie Pie,First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink! Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink! Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink! Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
Pinkie Pie,First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink! Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink! Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink! Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
Pinkie Pie,First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink! Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink! Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink! Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
Pinkie Pie,"There, see? Nothing to this babysitting business! Ugh!"
Pinkie Pie,"Snack time. That's easy enough. Okie-dokie! Eat up! Like this! Num-num-num, num-num-num-num! Ahh!"
Pumpkin Cake,Nom-
Pinkie Pie,"No, Pumpkin Cake, we eat food, not tablecloths."
Pinkie Pie,"Huh, huh? Uh, hey, guys, look at me!"
Pinkie Pie,Achoo!
Pinkie Pie,"Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!"
Pinkie Pie,Drop it... Drop it... Drop it!?
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't cry! Look, look, uh, floating things! Ooh, aaah, eeh!"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, don't make me do it, guys! You know what happens when you mix flour and water, don't you?"
Pinkie Pie,[sniffs] [gasps] [hoof on nose] Smells like somepony needs me to changy-wangy their diaper-wiper right now-a-wow! [tiptoeing noise] Easy... easy...
Pinkie Pie,"Wait- no- stay there- just- for a second- stand still, I've almost-"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, you've gotta be kidding me."
Pinkie Pie,Oh! Thank goodness they're home!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hi! I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa!"
Pinkie Pie,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like! I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy."
Twilight Sparkle,"It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by."
Pinkie Pie,Ex-cuse me?
Twilight Sparkle,"Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility."
Pinkie Pie,"Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit. I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm happy to help! It's no trouble<U+0096>
Pinkie Pie,"Well, of all the<U+0096> She thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I can handle things on my own!"
Pinkie Pie,"Pound Cake. [growls] This is a crib. It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!"
Pinkie Pie,"And you, young filly. We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!"
Pinkie Pie,"Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So, fall asleep!"
Pinkie Pie,[sighs] [kisses twice] Sleep tight.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, nononono. Not good, not good, not good! Pound? Pumpkin? Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
Pinkie Pie,"Whoa! You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!"
Pinkie Pie,"Pound Cake? [clicks] Here, Pound Cake!"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, Pound Cake? Uh..."
Pinkie Pie,[squeals] You can fly?!
Pinkie Pie,Oh... get down here... this instant... young... colt! [gasps for breath] I'm responsible for you!
Pumpkin Cake,[giggles] Nom nom nom.
Pinkie Pie,"No no no, Pumpkin."
Pumpkin Cake,Nom nom.
Pinkie Pie,No no.
Pumpkin Cake,Nom.
Pinkie Pie,"No. Hmph! I am the responsible one, and I said no."
Pound Cake,Wheeee!
Pinkie Pie,"That goes for you too, Pound Cake!"
Pinkie Pie,"Mm, razzleberry. I'm- not- letting- go! I'm- re-spon-si-ble!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, not you too! There! Now who's the responsible one?"
Pinkie Pie,"[giggles] Y'know, you're right. That is funny."
Pinkie Pie,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Pinkie Pie,"I've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today, I learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it."
Mr. Cake,Mr. Pinkie Pie! We're back!
Mr. Cake,Mr. Are we in the right place?
Pinkie Pie,Shhh!
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. P-Pinkie. This is just... just...
Mr. Cake,Mr. Amazing is what it is. We had no idea how responsible you really are. Would you be interested in becoming our go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never!
Pound Cake,Pinkie...
Pumpkin Cake,Pie...
Pinkie Pie,[happily gasps] I have some free time next Tuesday.
Apple Bloom,"Whoo-- Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Applejack, you're sure to knock everypony's hat off at the Equestria Rodeo competition!"
Applejack,"Aw shucks, Apple Bloom. I sure hope so."
Apple Bloom,"Hope so? I know so! After all, you're the ten-time rodeo champeen of Ponyville! Why, you've got more blue ribbons than anypony in Ponyville ever! And I can't wait for my big sis to win every blue ribbon in Equestria and bring home the title of Equestria Rodeo champeen!"
Rainbow Dash,"Huh? Now, careful, Derpy! Don't want to do any more damage than you've already done."
Derpy,I just don't know what went wrong.
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. It's a mystery.
Derpy,"Nice work, Rainbow Dash."
Derpy,"You okay, Rainbow Dash? Anything I can do to help?"
Rainbow Dash,"No! Nothing! In the name of Celestia, just sit there and do nothing!"
Derpy,Oops. My bad.
Mayor Mare,"Everypony, can I get your attention? Attention please!"
Mayor Mare,"Yes, we are all here to send Applejack to compete in this year's Equestria Rodeo competition in Canterlot."
Mayor Mare,And I want to thank Applejack in advance for generously offering up her prize money to fix town hall.
Derpy,"Yeah, Applejack! Whoo-hoo!"
Pinkie Pie,Speech! Speech!
Applejack,"Oh, shucks. I'm not much for speeches."
Pinkie Pie,"Alright then, no speech!"
Applejack,Buuut! This here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for. Y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since I was a little little pony. So it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall. I promise to make Ponyville proud.
Granny Smith,I want you to show all them highfalutin rodeo ponies what a real rodeo pony's like!
Applejack,"You betcha, Granny Smith."
Mayor Mare,And bring back all that money!
Applejack,"You betcha, Mayor."
Twilight Sparkle,"Just do your best, Applejack."
Applejack,I'll do better than my best!
Conductor,The train to Canterlot is about to leave! All aboard who's coming aboard!
Applejack,Guess that means me.
Rainbow Dash,Seeya in a week!
Apple Bloom,With lots of new blue ribbons!
Mayor Mare,And lots of money!
Applejack,"Darn tootin'! See y'all in a week, with a big bag full of blue ribbons!"
Pinkie Pie,And drink sarsaparilla! What? It gives you extra sass.
Fluttershy,"Oh, I hope Applejack is surprised by this surprise party!"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, that is the point."
Fluttershy,"I know, but I hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be... very startling."
Pinkie Pie,Surprise!
Fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, Pinkie, you startled me."
Pinkie Pie,"Sorry! I was just practicing my ""surprise!"" for when we surprise Applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champeen of Equestria! Surprise!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Quiet, Pinkie, I think Applejack's coming!"
Ponies,Surprise!
Pinkie Pie,Surprise! Shoot!
Parcel Post,"Wow, this is the best surprise ever! How did you know it was my birthday?"
Apple Bloom,"Who's it from, Twilight? What's it say?"
Twilight Sparkle,"It's from Applejack. ""Family and friends, not coming back to Ponyville."""
Twilight Sparkle,"""...Don't worry, will send money soon."" That's all there is."
Apple Bloom,Applejack's... not comin' back?
Rainbow Dash,What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?! She loves Ponyville!
Granny Smith,And she loves Sweet Apple Acres!
Apple Bloom,And she loves her family!
Rarity,[gasps] Something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!
Fluttershy,"Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!"
Rainbow Dash,"So, what are we waiting for? Let's go find her!"
Twilight Sparkle,Don't worry. We'll search all of Equestria if we have to. We'll bring her back.
Apple Bloom,Y'all are the best.
Granny Smith,"Thank you, girls! [to Big McIntosh] Our little bushel just lost one apple."
Rainbow Dash,I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end. I don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her.
Fluttershy,I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!
Pinkie Pie,I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!
Twilight Sparkle,"This is Dodge Junction, girls. Applejack is supposed to have come here after the rodeo ended. Let's fan out and try to find her."
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, pickles! [knocking] Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry! Hurry it up in there!"
Applejack,"Huh, some ponies. Sheesh."
Pinkie Pie,"Applejack! I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!"
Rarity,"Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!"
Fluttershy,We're so glad you're safe!
Pinkie Pie,"I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her! Be right back."
Applejack,"Uh, hey, everypony. What's up?"
Rainbow Dash,Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!
Rarity,"Yes, why are you here?"
Fluttershy,Are you okay?
Pinkie Pie,Do you have any snacks?
Twilight Sparkle,"Tell us what happened, Applejack!"
Cherry Jubilee,Applejack? Are these some of your Ponyville friends?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, ma'am."
Rarity,And you are?
Cherry Jubilee,"Why, I'm Cherry Jubilee, boss of Cherry Hill Ranch. Hasn't Applejack told ya? I saw her compete at the Equestria Rodeo. Never saw anypony win so many ribbons in all my life."
Applejack,"Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee. You don't have to go into all that."
Cherry Jubilee,"Oh, she's so modest. Anyway, I can always use a pony with quick hooves and a strong back. So, when I heard Applejack was looking for a change of scenery, I snapped her up as quick as I could and brought her to Dodge Junction. Well, I'll let you catch up with your friends. See you back at the ranch."
Rainbow Dash,"""Change of scenery""? What's that supposed to mean?"
Applejack,"S'no big deal, guys. I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here. That's it. End of story."
Pinkie Pie,"That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!"
Applejack,"Sorry, but that's all there is to tell. Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing a-okay."
Rainbow Dash,"Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you!"
Applejack,"Well, I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville!"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't care what she says. Applejack's not telling us something.
Rainbow Dash,Twilight's right. We gotta get her to spill the beans.
Pinkie Pie,"What?! She had beans? Ugh, I told her I was snacky!"
Cherry Jubilee,"You ready to put your back into it, Applejack?"
Applejack,"Sure am, Miss Jubilee."
Cherry Jubilee,"Terr-ific. Come on in, girls!"
Applejack,What are you all doing here?
Twilight Sparkle,We're your cherry sorters. Shall we get started?
Applejack,Fine.
Cherry Jubilee,"Haha, red cherries go in one bin, and yellow cherries go in the other. Simple as cherry pie. Uh, just one teensy thing to remember <U+0096> have fun!"
Applejack,What are you five up to?
Rarity,"Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful."
Applejack,"Uh-huh. Well, just remember: No talking about Ponyville."
Rainbow Dash,Fine! Why don't you quit talking and get walking?
Twilight Sparkle,"So, AJ, how was Canterlot? Not talking about Ponyville, talking about Canterlot, totally different town."
Applejack,Canterlot was fine.
Twilight Sparkle,Was the rodeo fun?
Applejack,Yes.
Twilight Sparkle,Did you meet some nice ponies there?
Applejack,Some.
Rainbow Dash,Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok? What about Calamity Mane?
Applejack,"Yes, I saw 'em both."
Rarity,And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?
Applejack,"Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. Real good treats."
Fluttershy,"Um, excuse me?"
Applejack,"Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. We struck up a conversation, being orchard folk and all."
Twilight Sparkle,So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?
Applejack,Yes.
Rainbow Dash,Did you tell her why you weren't going back?
Applejack,"No, 'cuz it was none of her business!"
Fluttershy,Ooh... Can you please slow down?
Rainbow Dash,Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?
Applejack,No!
Fluttershy,Help!
Twilight Sparkle,Is it because you were insulted when I gave you that book on organized orchards?
Applejack,NO!
Rarity,Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?
Applejack,"No, no, NO! I'm not telling you why, so just<U+0096>"
Fluttershy,STOP!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, girls, we seem to be striking out."
Rainbow Dash,That's 'cause we're playing too nice.
Rarity,Yes. Desperate times do call for desperate measures.
Rainbow Dash,It's time to call in the big guns.
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Applejack. Need some help?"
Applejack,You promise not to ask me any questions?
Pinkie Pie,I promise.
Pinkie Pie,"Have you ever had a cherrychanga? Ooh! Sorry, that was a question."
Applejack,"That kind of question is fine, Pinkie. No, I-I never had a cherrychanga."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, no wonder, because I made it up myself! A cherrychanga is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried. Cherrychanga. Great name, huh? Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimicherry. Ooh, that's good too. Which do you think sounds better? Cherrychanga or chimicherry? Or what if I combine them? Chimicherrychanga! What sounds the funniest? I like funny words! One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'! I didn't make that one up. I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day! Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat! And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that just the funnest thing to say? Pickle barrel, pickle barrel, pickle barrel! Say it with me! Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, chimicherrychanga!"
Applejack,"No! Make it stop, make it stop!"
Rainbow Dash,The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans!
Applejack,Never!
Applejack,"Alright, alright! I'll tell everypony what's goin' on! Just please stop talkin'! But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out."
Rainbow Dash,"Tomorrow, huh? I don't know..."
Pinkie Pie,Do you Pinkie promise?
Applejack,[sighs] I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast. Pinkie promise.
Twilight Sparkle,I'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from Applejack.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, maybe."
Pinkie Pie,"Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta 'fess up after making a Pinkie promise."
Pinkie Pie,Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!
Pinkie Pie,Applejack! [slightly distorted] You Pinkie promised!
Pinkie Pie,"Applejack, come back here!"
Applejack,"Giddy up, fellas, I gotta get the heck out of Dodge!"
Pinkie Pie,She's gonna get away!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh no, she won't! Look, girls!"
Pinkie Pie,"Follow that stagecoach! Oh, we have you now!"
Applejack,Whoa! What the hay?
Rainbow Dash,Pull over!
Applejack,Hey! Cut that out! Whoa! [to coach ponies] I'll pay you double to outrun them.
Twilight Sparkle,We'll pay you triple to slow down!
Applejack,I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!
Rarity,That was rude!
Pinkie Pie,Get them! Get them!
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Fluttershy!"
Applejack,"Hyah! C'mon, y'all! Go, go!"
Pinkie Pie,"Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!"
Applejack,"Pinkie, I did not break my promise!"
Pinkie Pie,Wha?
Applejack,"If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast. But I didn't come for breakfast. I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, I... I..."
Applejack,"I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth. I just can't!"
Pinkie Pie,"Well I heard a ""sorry"" in there, so that'll have to do for now. I'll get a real apology later. Rarity, catch me."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow, go back!"
Rainbow Dash,No time! They knew what they were getting into!
Applejack,Yes. Hyah!
Applejack,Yee-haw!
Coach ponies,"[in unison] Lady, you're trouble."
Applejack,"Ha, try and catch me now. Oh, nuts."
Rainbow Dash,Not so fast!
Applejack,Fine. Now you know.
Twilight Sparkle,Know what?
Applejack,"Well, just look!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I am. You won an amazing number of ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!"
Applejack,"Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue. I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money."
Rainbow Dash,But the telegram said you were gonna send money.
Applejack,"That's why I came here. I wanted to earn some money. After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come home empty-hooved. I couldn't come home a failure."
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, you're not a failure."
Rainbow Dash,And we're your friends! We don't care if you came in fiftieth place! You're still number one in our books.
Applejack,So... you're not upset or disappointed?
Others,"Fluttershy, Nn-nn."
Applejack,But what about the mayor? I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof.
Fluttershy,"Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof. But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts."
Rainbow Dash,[sniffles] Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!
Applejack,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Applejack,It's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. But there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. You can't run away from your problems. Better to run to your friends and family.
Fluttershy,[yawns] Who could that be? It's still dark!
Rainbow Dash,"C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider season's about to start!"
Fluttershy,"[squee] [shrieks] Oh, where are we? What's the rush?"
Rainbow Dash,The rush? Don't you remember what happened last year? Or the year before that? Or pretty much any cider season ever?
Fluttershy,"Um, well, uh<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie. She always ends up ahead of us in line, and then they always run out of cider!"
Fluttershy,I guess I<U+0096>
Fluttershy,"Gee, Rainbow Dash. It looks like a few other ponies had the same idea."
Fluttershy,"Oh, gosh, Pinkie. I love your new style."
Rainbow Dash,Who are all these ponies?!
Pinkie Pie,"Isn't this great? I couldn't sleep last night 'cause I was so excited about cider season, and I had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so I told a few others about it, and they all thought it was a great idea too, and now it's just a big old cider party! Woo-hoo! Oh, gosh, that's a lot of ponies. Hope they don't run out before you get any."
Twilight Sparkle,"Isn't this exciting, Spike? Opening day of cider season!"
Spike,Yeah! That means it's only thirty more days 'til sapphire season!
Applejack,"[through megaphone] Attention, everypony! Cider season is now officially open!"
Applejack,"Heh. Sorry, everypony! That's it for today!"
Ponies,Awww.
Rainbow Dash,"Surprise, surprise. You ran out again!"
Caramel,"Yeah, you always run out!"
Fluttershy,"For the record, I don't mind<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,Why can't you make enough cider for all of us? Or at least for me!
Applejack,"Hold on, everypony. We've done our best to improve supply this year-"
Caramel,You always say that!
Applejack,"And it's always true. But Apple family cider is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in Equestria. Sorry, but that recipe takes time."
Applejack,"If y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow."
Pinkie Pie,"She's right, y'know! You can't rush perfection! And this year's batch was perfection!"
Fluttershy,"Uh, Pinkie Pie<U+0096>"
Applejack,What in Equestria is that?
Flim,"Well, lookie what we got here, brother of mine, it's the same in every town Ponies with thirsty throats, dry tongues, and not a drop of cider to be found Maybe they're not aware that there's really no need for this teary despair"

Granny Smith,"Now wait, you fellers, hold it! You went and over-sold it! I guarantee that what you have there won't compare For the very most important ingredient Can't be added or done expedient And it's quality, friends, Apple Acres' quality and care!"
Flim,"Well, Granny, I'm glad you brought that up, my dear, I say I'm glad you brought that up You see that we are very picky when it comes to cider if you'll kindly try a cup"
Flam,"Yes, sir, yes, ma'am, this great machine lets just the very best  So whaddaya say then, Apples?  Care to step into the modern world And put the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to the test?"

Others,"[Flim, Flam, and Crowd] Opportunity In this very community He's Flim, he's Flam We're the world famous Flim Flam Brothers Traveling salesponies nonpareil!"
Flim and Flam,Yeah!
Apple Bloom,You got a deal!
Granny Smith,Not so fast! No way no how that machine matches up with the care we put in our cider!
Apple Bloom,"But if it really does work, we could make everypony in town happy!"
Applejack,"I just don't know, y'all. We've always made cider the same way."
Big McIntosh,Eeyup. Huh?
Flim,We'll sweeten the deal. You supply the apples...
Flam,...We supply the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.
Flim and Flam,Then we split those sweet sweet profits...
Flim,...Seventy-five...
Flam,...Twenty-five.
Apple Bloom,Deal<U+0096>
Applejack,Hold on. Who gets the seventy five?
Flim,"Why, us, naturally."
Flam,"And, we'll throw in the magic to power the machine for free."
Applejack,Cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter. We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.
Flim and Flam,So? What'll it be?
Big McIntosh,No deal.
Flim,"Hmph. Very well. If you refuse our generous offer to be partners, then we'll just have to be competitors."
Applejack,You wouldn't dare.
Flim,Oh no?
Flam,"Don't you worry, everypony! There'll be plenty of cider for all of you!"
Flim,[quietly] Once we drive Sweet Apple Acres out of business.
Apple Bloom,What?
Twilight Sparkle,Still worried about Flim and Flam?
Spike,Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air.
Applejack,I'm not so sure. They sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business.
Apple Bloom,That's it! Last cup!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, for Pete's sake!"
Apple Bloom,"C'mon back tomorrow, everypony!"
Flim,What seems to be the problem here?
Flam,"Oh my, oh my, out of cider again?"
Flim,What have we here? Who'd like a cup?
Flam,"Don't worry, everypony, we've got the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to make more in an instant!"
Applejack,You can't sell that cider! That's made from Apple family apples!
Rainbow Dash,Is this some kind of cruel joke?
Flim,"Don't worry, everypony, there are plenty of apples in Equestria. We'll find some others and make more cider than all of Ponyville can drink!"
Apple Bloom,We'll make more cider than you could ever imagine!
Granny Smith,"Now, it ain't about the speed, young'un, it's about quality."
Rainbow Dash,Who cares how good the cider is if I never get to drink any?
Flim,"Oh, look at these poor, dissatisfied ponies."
Apple Bloom,Ponyville is Sweet Apple Cider country!
Applejack,Our cider speaks for itself!
Flim,Let's put it to the test!
Apple Bloom,"Anywhere, anytime!"
Granny Smith,"Well, that's enough now."
Flam,"With our machine, we can make enough cider in one hour to satisfy this entire town!"
Apple Bloom,We'll do it in 45 minutes!
Granny Smith,"Easy, Apple Bloom, easy."
Flim,"What's the matter, Granny Smith? Chicken?"
Granny Smith,"What did you call me, sonny?"
Flim,"If you're so confident in your cider, then what's the problem?"
Granny Smith,"Tomorrow mornin', right here!"
Flam,But I'm afraid we haven't any... [spits] ...apples.
Granny Smith,You can use our south field! It'll be worth it to teach y'all a thing or two about cider making!
Flim,Excellent; we have a bet. Whoever produces the most barrels in one hour wins the exclusive right to sell cider in Ponyville.
Granny Smith,"And after we beat ya, I don't never want to see you bambahoozlers around here again!"
Flam,Until tomorrow.
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, Applejack, I know you'll win tomorrow!"
Applejack,"We'd better, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose our farm."
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack? Are you sure this is such a good idea?
Applejack,Me 'n' the family are... one hundred percent confident... in our cider making capabilities.
Apple Bloom,"And besides, nopony calls Granny a chicken."
Mayor Mare,"[through megaphone] Attention, everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, good luck."
Applejack,"Thanks, Twilight. We'll need it."
Mayor Mare,"[through megaphone] The teams have one hour to produce as much cider as they can, after which the barrels will be counted and the winner will be named the sole cider provider for all of Ponyville!"
Mayor Mare,Are both teams ready?
Applejack,Ready!
Flim and Flam,Ready!
Mayor Mare,Then let's... go!
Granny Smith,"Ugh, bad 'un. Good 'un! Bad 'un..."
Applejack,"Great job, y'all! We've already filled an entire barrel!"
Apple Bloom,I'll bet you those guys don't even have<U+0096>
Apple Bloom,What?!
Applejack,"C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus! We gotta forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winnin'!"
Apple Bloom,"Sorry, sis! Better keep up, Granny, we're fallin' behind!"
Granny Smith,"Egh... [sniffs] Good 'un... Ugh, bad 'un..."
Applejack,"Rest when it's over, Big McIntosh! Ride! Ride!"
Rarity,This is just dreadful. Even at top speed the Apples are only making one barrel to the twins' three!
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members allowed to help in the competition?"
Mayor Mare,"Well, I'm not sure... Flim, Flam, would you object to honorary family members helping?"
Flim,Are you kidding?
Flam,We don't care if the whole kingdom of Canterlot helps. It's a lost cause.
Mayor Mare,"Hm, I guess it's okay. Applejack? What do you think?"
Applejack,I think I'd love to have the rest of my family helpin' out.
Rest of main cast,All right!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, everypony, we're not gonna let those smooth talkers take our friend's farm."
Rest of main cast,Yeah!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees."
Fluttershy,Got it.
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail."
Pinkie Pie,"Yessir, ma'am, sir!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, you've got a discerning eye. Help Granny Smith at the quality control station."
Rarity,Of course.
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, do you think you can help Big McIntosh press?"
Rainbow Dash,In my sleep!
Twilight Sparkle,"Alright, everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!"
Rest of main cast,All right!
Pinkie Pie,"Over there, Apple Bloom! Don't miss them!"
Apple Bloom,"Right behind you, Pinkie Pie!"
Granny Smith,"Good 'un, bad 'un, bad 'un, good 'un..."
Rarity,"Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Based on these figures, we're making five barrels for every three of theirs!"
Applejack,"Keep it up, everypony! We're back in this!"
Flim,"[spits] Come on, brother, we've gotta pick up the pace!"
Flam,"Right, uh, double the power!"
Flim,We've gotta try something else!
Flam,"I've got it, brother of mine."
Flim,"Well done, Flam! We're at top productivity!"
Twilight Sparkle,"C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding!"
Rainbow Dash,We don't have time for quality control if we wanna win this thing!
Granny Smith,"[yelps] Get back, you! One bad apple spoils the bunch!"
Rainbow Dash,"Applejack, help me!"
Applejack,There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!
Twilight Sparkle,"We'll just have to work harder! C'mon, everypony!"
Rainbow Dash,"All right then, double time!"
Mayor Mare,Time's up!
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm proud of you, Applejack."
Twilight Sparkle,Integrity like that will always be... rewarded.
Mayor Mare,Flim and Flam win!
Apple Bloom,"Wh, wh<U+0096>"
Applejack,We... lost?
Flim,"Daww, too bad, Apples."
Flam,Guess you'll just have to find a new line of work that doesn't match your names quite so... perfectly.
Flim,"Now should we tear down all these tacky old buildings and put up new ones, brother?"
Flam,"I don't see why not, brother. After all, this isn't Sweet Apple Acres anymore. How about 'Flim Flam Fields'?"
Rainbow Dash,I ought to press you into jerk cider!
Applejack,"No, Rainbow Dash. A deal's a deal."
Applejack,"Congratulations to y'all. The cider business in Ponyville... is yours. C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things."
Flim,"Fear not, everypony, there's more than enough cider to go around."
Applejack,"Go ahead, everypony. Go on, y'all. It's okay."
Flam,"Drink up, Ponyville! Down the hatch!"
Cherry Berry,I can't get the taste off my tongue!
Sweetie Drops,Mine's got rocks in it!
Comet Tail,I wouldn't pay one cent for this dreck!
Flam,You wouldn't pay even one cent?
Crowd,No!
Flam,How about two cups for one cent?
Crowd,No!
Flim and Flam,[mumbling to each other] Two bits for a barrel?
Crowd,NO!
Flam,[nervous noises] It looks like we've encountered a slight... problem here in Ponyville.
Flim,Nopony wants our product. Next town?
Flam,"Next town. Let's go, Flim!"
Flim,"Let's go, Flam!"
Applejack,They're gone.
Twilight Sparkle,That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business!
Caramel,Plus we can have high quality Apple family cider!
Apple Bloom,"Because of this silly competition, we've made enough of our cider for the whole town!"
Applejack,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Applejack,"I wanted to share my thoughts with you. [clears throat] I didn't learn anythin'! Ha! I was right all along! If you take your time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself. Sure I could tell you I learned something about how my friends are always there to help me, and I can count on them no matter what, but truth is, I knew that already too."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Rarity. Hey, Pinkie Pie. What are you looking at?"
Pinkie Pie,"Rainbow Dash! Isn't she the most daring devil? I mean, the most devilish darer? I mean<U+0097>"
Rarity,She's dazzling!
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, yeah, that's a good word. She's dazzling!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh no, oh no, oh no!"
Pinkie Pie,Ai yi yi yi yi!
Others,"Pinkie Pie, Oohh."
Pinkie Pie,So much for dazzling.
Applejack,[muffled] Is she gonna be okay?
Fluttershy,"[muffled] Oh, I'm so worried!"
Pinkie Pie,[muffled] Is her face gonna stay that way?
Rainbow Dash,Awwww.
Twilight Sparkle,"How is she, doctor?"
Doctor Horse,She's going to be fine. Luckily she has friends like you who got her over here in a jiffy.
Rainbow Dash,"Huh, how long do I need to lie here? I've got things I need to do!"
Doctor Horse,"Well, that all depends on your recovery, but I'd say a few days minimum."
Rainbow Dash,You guys have gotta get me out of here! I'm gonna climb the walls!
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, just like a spider! [to Doctor Horse] Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers?"
Doctor Horse,"Nnnno, nor did it give her amazing healing powers. She needs to stay in bed for a few days."
Rainbow Dash,"Few days? Might as well be a few months, or a few years!"
Fluttershy,"It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash."
Applejack,I bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good.
Rarity,"And the hospital gowns, they...match the curtains!"
Pinkie Pie,And look! You have a roommate!
Rainbow Dash,What's this? 'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone'.
Rainbow Dash,"No thanks. I so don't read. I'm a world-class athlete. Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight. Heh, no offense, but I am not reading. It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool."
Applejack,Is she serious? Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?
Rarity,"Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Reading is for everypony, Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! I love reading, and my head isn't even close to the shape of an egg! It's more the shape of an apple, or maybe an orange, but a big orange! More like a grapefruit really..."
Others,"""Nurse Sweetheart"": All right, my little ponies. Rainbow Dash needs her rest. You'll have to come back tomorrow."
Twilight Sparkle,"I think you'd like Daring. She's a lot like you. Adventurous, fierce, and undeniably, unquestionably, unstoppable."
Rainbow Dash,...to get to the other side! Get it? Never mind...
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] [unenthusiastically] ""As Daring Do trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and slowed her every step. If only she could escape this oppressive atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky. But her crash landing in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days. Few days... it might as well be a few months, or a few years!"" Huh. I'm right there with you, sister."
Rainbow Dash,"[voiceover] ""The mosquitoes buzzed loudly. The macaws cried from the high trees. Yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step."""
Rainbow Dash,"[voiceover, steadily getting more excited] ""Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe. She turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights!"""
Rainbow Dash,"I hate to admit it to myself, and would really hate to admit it to my friends, but... I love this story! I, I... I love reading! I'm an egghead."
Rainbow Dash,"[voiceover] ""The smell of decay and danger hit Daring Do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the ancient temple."""
Daring Do,Phew!
Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle,"Hi, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, hey, guys..."
Fluttershy,We thought we'd come and cheer you up!
Twilight Sparkle,We brought your favorite board game!
Fluttershy,We know how much you like to win!
Twilight Sparkle,"You go first, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,"[short nervous laugh] No no, you first."
Twilight Sparkle,"Alright, uh... cloud three."
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, shucks, you... rained on my cumulus, heh. Go again!"
Fluttershy,Um... sky five?
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, you found my seagull."
Twilight Sparkle,Uh... cloud two?
Fluttershy,"But Rainbow Dash, you, you didn't even get a turn."
Rainbow Dash,"You win some, you lose some."
Twilight Sparkle,But you don't lose some. I don't think you've ever lost a game of<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,[yawns] Thanks for coming!
Twilight Sparkle,But yesterday you were desperate for things to do!
Fluttershy,Glad we could... cheer you up?
Twilight Sparkle,Alright then.
Rainbow Dash,"""Daring Do stood at the entrance to the central temple chamber."""
Rainbow Dash,"[voiceover] ""At last, she was face-to-face with the legendary sapphire statue!"""
Daring Do,"Hmm, there must be a pattern here. What do all these animals have in common? Ah-ha! These animals are all predators... except... rats! Phew!"
Others,"Ahuizotl [with Pinkie Pie's voice]: Hello, Rainbow Dash!"
Rarity,How's our patient doing today?
Applejack,"Ugh, we need to get some fresh air in here. You're lookin' sweatier than a pig wrangler on a summer's day."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, well, guys, thanks for visiting, but<U+0097>"
Nurse Snowheart,"Okay, now, dinner time for Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, just in time. I am sooo hungry."
Rarity,"Oh, well, don't mind us, Rainbow Dash."
Applejack,"Yeah, just go ahead and eat up."
Rarity,"Uh, on second thought<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, we'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash, aheh..."
Rainbow Dash,"[spits] ""'You thought you could evade me and capture the relic for yourself, but you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do.'"""
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! Who is this dude?
Daring Do,"[pants] You won't get away with this, Ahuizotl!"
Ahuizotl,But I already have.
Daring Do,[exasperated sigh] Not again...
Doctor Horse,[echoing] Rainbow Dash?
Doctor Horse,[muffled] Rainbow Dash? [normal] Rainbow Da-ash!
Rainbow Dash,"H<U+0097> oh, good evening<U+0097>"
Doctor Horse,Morning.
Rainbow Dash,<U+0097>morning. Doc.
Doctor Horse,Have you been up all night?
Doctor Horse,"Well, I'll be quick. Congratulations, Rainbow Dash, we're checking you out of the hospital."
Doctor Horse,No. Right now!
Rainbow Dash,Right now?! 'Right now' right now?
Doctor Horse,'Right now' right now.
Rainbow Dash,But I don't feel better!
Doctor Horse,"Now take it easy, Rainbow Dash. Remember to stay off that wing for a week."
Rainbow Dash,How will I ever find out what happens to Daring Do?!
Rainbow Dash,"Is Ahuizotl going to get away with the statuette? What's gonna happen to Daring?! Ah-ha! Twilight has a copy of the book! Uh, but I can't ask her after I called her an egghead and all..."
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, this is making me sick all over again!"
Rainbow Dash,"Owww... [grunts in pain unrealistically] Oh, the pain... the pain!"
Doctor Horse,"Rainbow Dash! What are you doing here, a-anything wrong?"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, uh, my wing! It's still hurtin', Doc. Oh, ouch! Right there."
Doctor Horse,I was touching your good wing.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, right. Well, I think that one's hurting now too."
Doctor Horse,[chuckles] I think I know what the trouble is. A severe case of lazy-itis.
Rainbow Dash,"B-But, you got me all wrong, Doc! I'm not being lazy!"
Doctor Horse,"You're fine, Rainbow Dash. Give it some time and you'll be right back in the swing of things."
Others,"""Nurse Sweetheart"": Good day, Rainbow Dash."
Nurse Snowheart,Take care!
Rainbow Dash,What am I gonna do? I'll never get to sleep without knowing what happens to Daring Do! ...Which may not be such a bad thing...
Daring Do,"Feels like the harder I struggle, [grunts] the tighter the ropes get!"
Others,"Spider [with ""Fuzzy Slippers""'s voice]: Help! Burglar, burglar!"
Others,"""Fuzzy Slippers"": Someone's trying to steal my slippers!"
Rainbow Dash,"I'm not trying to steal your slippers, I'm trying to steal this book!"
Others,"""Nurse Sweetheart"": Stop, thief!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, nopony invited me!"
Rarity,Huh! Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?
Doctor Horse,"Rainbow Dash, what in the world is going on? Why are you stealing slippers?"
Night Watch,"Hey, get back to the hospital!"
Applejack,What's all the ruckus?
Pinkie Pie,"Mmm, I'd say it's more of a fracas than a ruckus."
Twilight Sparkle,"What's going on, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I'm an egghead.
Rarity,Pardon?
Rainbow Dash,"See, I was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter of<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,<U+0097>'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue'!
Rainbow Dash,You got me.
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, I knew the book was good, but I didn't know it could drive a pony to petty theft!"
Rainbow Dash,"Good? Try awesomely amazing. That book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able! But then I had to put it down; I was sent home before I could finish it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'm glad that's all this is about."
Applejack,There's no reason to go around causin' a ruckus<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,Fracas!
Applejack,...causin' a fracas just because you like to read.
Twilight Sparkle,"Like I said, I have every book in the series, and you can borrow them all, any time you like!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, thanks, Twilight. I'm sorry I made such a big deal about all of this. I thought reading was just for smart ponies like you."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic doesn't mean you aren't smart!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Reading is something everypony can enjoy, if they just give it a try."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I get it. I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it."
Twilight Sparkle,"That's a great lesson, and it would make a great letter to the Princess."
Rainbow Dash,[to Spike] Didja get all that?
Spike,Yeah?
Daring Do,"[takes deep breaths] Another day, another dungeon!"
Daring Do,I'll take that!
Ahuizotl,Huh? Wha<U+0097>? Noooooooo!
Daring Do,"Better luck next time, Ahuizotl!"
Rainbow Dash,"[voiceover] ""And so, with Ahuizotl defeated, and the sapphire statue secured..."""
Rainbow Dash,"""...The world was safe and sound once again, thanks to Daring Do!"" [sighs in admiration] 'Daring Do and the Griffon's Goblet'. Awesome!"
Apple Bloom,Hmm... I just don't feel like it's quite finished.
Sweetie Belle,"I know what you mean. If it's for Miss Cheerilee, it needs to be perfect. Hearts and Hooves Day only comes once a year, after all."
Scootaloo,I say we add a little more ribbon!
Sweetie Belle,"Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. And just a tiny bit more lace."
Apple Bloom,A few more hoof-prints.
Scootaloo,Glitter! It could definitely use just a little more glitter!
Apple Bloom,Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee how much we care about her. Just have to get it to the Hearts and Hooves party at school.
Scootaloo,I think we're gonna need a bigger envelope.
Diamond Tiara,I like the red ones.
Cheerilee,It's lovely. And so... big!
Apple Bloom,We just wanted to let you know that we think you're the best teacher in the whole wide world! And we think you're super! And that we love you so so much! And we want you to have the best Hearts and Hooves Day<U+0096>
Others,"Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, Ever!"
Cheerilee,"Thank you so much, girls. I love it. I really do."
Sweetie Belle,I'm sure it's nothing compared to the gifts you've gotten from your... very special somepony.
Cheerilee,"Oh, I don't have a very special somepony at the moment."
Apple Bloom,Really?
Sweetie Belle,How could somepony as amazing as you not have a very special somepony on Hearts and Hooves Day?
Cheerilee,"It's alright, Sweetie Belle. I have lots of good friends and wonderful students who care about me very much. I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific Hearts and Hooves Day. Alright, everypony, who's ready to play ""Pin the Heart on the Pony""?"
Apple Bloom,"If anypony deserves a very special somepony, it's her."
Apple Bloom,"Uh, you all right?"
Sweetie Belle,I'm more than all right. I've just come up with the best idea ever. We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee a very special somepony.
Apple Bloom,That is the best idea ever.
Sweetie Belle,[singsong voice] Tooold yooou!
Apple Bloom,So what are we waiting for? Hearts and Hooves Day is almost over! Let's get out there and find somepony special for Cheerilee already.
Sweetie Belle,Yeah!
Scootaloo,Let's do it!
Sweetie Belle,Now it can't be just anypony. Miss Cheerilee is one of the best mares in Ponyville. She deserves to have one of the best stallions as her very special somepony.
Sweetie Belle,"Cheerilee is sweet and kind, She's the best teacher we could hope for. The perfect stallion you and I must find One to really make her heart so-o-oar. But... This one's too young, This one's too old. He clearly has a terrible cold."
Others,"""Hay Fever"": Achoo!"
Apple Bloom,This guy's too silly. He's way too uptight.
Others,"""Persnickety"": I say!"
Sweetie Belle,"Well nothing's wrong with this one, He seems alright..."
Scootaloo,His girlfriend sure thinks so.
Sweetie Belle,How 'bout this one?
Apple Bloom,He's much too flashy.
Scootaloo,He might do!
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,If he weren't so splashy!
Apple Bloom,Too short.
Sweetie Belle,Too tall.
Apple Bloom,Too clean.
Scootaloo,Too smelly.
Sweetie Belle,Too strangely obsessed with tubs of jelly.
Apple Bloom,"I don't think that we're mistaken, It seems all the good ones are taken."
Sweetie Belle,"I really feel that at this rate, We'll never find the perfect date."
Others,"[Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle] Don't wanna quit and give up hope!"
Scootaloo,Doing anything special for Hearts and Hooves Day?
Sweetie Belle,"Oh please, oh please oh please say-"
Big McIntosh,Nope.
Sweetie Belle,"We did it girls, We've found the one, Who will send our teacher's heart aflutter!"
Apple Bloom,Wait a minute. Lemme get this straight. Are you talkin' 'bout my brother?
Scootaloo,"Sweetie Belle is right. Big McIntosh is the perfect match for Miss Cheerilee. He's really nice, super hard-working."
Apple Bloom,Hmm... but he's also pretty shy. He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee to be his very special somepony.
Sweetie Belle,Maybe he doesn't have to.
Apple Bloom,Huh?
Sweetie Belle,"If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee in a really romantic setting, I bet she'll ask him."
Scootaloo,Sounds like a plan to me.
Apple Bloom,So? What are we waitin' for? Let's get out there and create the perfect date!
Others,"Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, Yay!"
Sweetie Belle,Flowers. Don't forget the flowers.
Apple Bloom,Oops. I'm on it!
Scootaloo,[gasp] They're coming! This is gonna be perfect. Miss Cheerilee is gonna have the best Hearts and Hooves Day ever.
Sweetie Belle,With her new very special somepony.
Cheerilee,"Hi, girls."
Others,"Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, Hi, Miss Cheerilee."
Cheerilee,So you three said you needed help identifying a tree you found here near the gazebo?
Cheerilee,[dryly] That's an apple tree.
Apple Bloom,Is it?
Apple Bloom,"Oh, sorry, big brother. We went and fixed up the gazebo all on our own. See?"
Scootaloo,"As long as you're here, why not have a bite to eat from this romantic-looking picnic? Oh gosh, seems like there's only room for two."
Apple Bloom,I guess we'll just be goin' then.
Scootaloo,You really think this'll work?
Sweetie Belle,Of course it will work. They're perfect for each other.
Cheerilee,Beautiful day we're having.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Cheerilee,Any big plans for tonight?
Big McIntosh,Nnnope.
Apple Bloom,"Oh, come on, Miss Cheerilee, ask him to be your very special somepony."
Sweetie Belle,"[gasp] Ohmigosh, look."
Cheerilee,Big Mac...
Big McIntosh,Eeyup?
Cheerilee,You have something stuck in your teeth.
Sweetie Belle,"Aw, come on!"
Cheerilee,Well this has been... strange.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Cheerilee,"I need to get going, but it's always great running into a good friend."
Big McIntosh,Yup.
Apple Bloom,[sigh] Do you think it just wasn't romantic enough?
Scootaloo,Maybe it was too romantic.
Sweetie Belle,"[sigh] Either way, we failed."
Apple Bloom,[sigh] There's gotta be somethin' else we could<U+0096> UGH!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh my goodness, I didn't even see you there. I'm so so sorry."
Apple Bloom,"Aw, it's okay, Twilight. It was an accident."
Twilight Sparkle,I've just been reading the most fascinating book about Hearts and Hooves Day. Did you know that this holiday got its start because of a love potion?
Sweetie Belle,Did you say... a love potion?
Twilight Sparkle,That's right. It even has the recipe.
Sweetie Belle,"I... don't suppose we could borrow that book for a little while, do ya?"
Twilight Sparkle,Of course you can. I have another book here that I think you'll<U+0096>
Sweetie Belle,[giggling] Take a tuft of cloud;
Sweetie Belle,A bright rainbow's glow;
Sweetie Belle,Stir with a Pegasus feather<U+0096>
Scootaloo,Hey!
Sweetie Belle,"Fast, not slow."
Apple Bloom,Serve to two ponies who aren't in the know.
Apple Bloom,I feel kind of bad trickin' my brother and Miss Cheerilee this way.
Sweetie Belle,What's the problem? We all agreed these two are perfect for one another.
Scootaloo,"Yeah, they just need a little nudge."
Sweetie Belle,"And what could make them happier than being together, right?"
Apple Bloom,Right!
Scootaloo,"Oh, oh, here they come."
Apple Bloom,"Hiya, Miss Cheerilee."
Cheerilee,"Hello again, girls. Hello, Big Mac. Would you three like to tell us why it was so very important that we meet you here<U+0096>"
Sweetie Belle,Punch!
Cheerilee,Excuse me?
Sweetie Belle,"Punch! We made punch. We were gonna set up a stand and try to sell it but, heh, we needed somepony to taste-test it first."
Apple Bloom,Yup.
Cheerilee,"I'm very sorry about this. I mentioned to the girls that I don't have a very special somepony, and I believe they're putting us in these awkward situations because they've decided it should be you."
Cheerilee,I suppose we should just humor them for a moment. This punch does look delicious.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Sweetie Belle,I think they're gonna drink it.
Cheerilee,To good friends!
Scootaloo,They're drinking it. They're drinking it!
Scootaloo,They're looking into each other's eyes.
Others,"Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, [giggling] They're about to be in for a big surprise!"
Cheerilee,Big Mac?
Big McIntosh,Yup?
Cheerilee,Will you be my very special somepony?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Sweetie Belle,YES!
Others,"Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, [singsong voice] He's her special somepony! She's his special somepony!"
Cheerilee,He's my special somepony.
Big McIntosh,Eeeeeyup.
Others,"Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, Aww!"
Cheerilee,He's my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.
Big McIntosh,You're my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.
Apple Bloom,Did he just say<U+0096>
Cheerilee,You're my cutie-patootie lovie-dovie honey-bunny.
Big McIntosh,You're my heartie-smartie smoochie-woochie baby-waby.
Apple Bloom,Big Mac! Hey! Hello! What's going on?
Sweetie Belle,"Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?"
Cheerilee,I have a special somepony. A kissy-wissy snuggy-wuggy sugar bear.
Sweetie Belle,I think we may have given them too big of a nudge.
Big McIntosh,You're my cuddly-wuddly boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie.
Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo,Eugh!!
Scootaloo,Ya think?
Apple Bloom,What have we done?! My brother's actin' like a grade-A goofball!
Sweetie Belle,Maybe we added too much rainbow.
Scootaloo,Or maybe not enough cloud.
Sweetie Belle,Or maybe... uh-oh.
Apple Bloom,"Whaddaya mean, ""uh-oh?!"""
Sweetie Belle,We might not have given Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee a love potion. We may have given them a love poison.
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,What?!
Sweetie Belle,"Apparently, some prince a long time ago whipped up this recipe and gave it to this princess he liked. He meant it to be a love potion, but things didn't turn out so well."
Apple Bloom,"How ""not so well"" did things turn out?"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, there's something here about a dragon, the kingdom falling, chaos reigning... Okay, apparently it was all because the prince and princess were so lost in each other's eyes that they couldn't perform their royal duties."
Apple Bloom,"Great! We've not only turned Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee into a couple of nonsense-spoutin' nincompoops, we may have put all of Ponyville in jeopardy!"
Scootaloo,"Come on, Apple Bloom. Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac don't have any royal duties."
Apple Bloom,"But they still got responsibilities. If we don't fix this... Oh no, Miss Cheerilee won't be able to teach. Big Mac won't be able to harvest any apples, and before you know it... Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated little ponies starvin' for apples. Oh, it'll be chaos! It'll be chaos!"
Sweetie Belle,There's an antidote!
Apple Bloom,"Well, why didn't you say so? Didn't you see me gettin' all panicked back there?"
Sweetie Belle,"If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac from looking into each other's eyes for one full hour, the love curse will be broken."
Scootaloo,"Only an hour? Pfh, we can pull that off in a second."
Cheerilee,"You take the first sip, snuggle-wuggles."
Big McIntosh,"No, you take it, schnoodle-dumplin'."
Cheerilee,"No, you, shnooky-lumps."
Big McIntosh,"No, you, pookie-pie."
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. I'm all for romance, but this has been going on for hours. What's happened to these two?"
Sweetie Belle,[nervous chuckle] Who knows?
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Well, these lovebirds will probably be planning a wedding soon. I can always use the catering business."
Sweetie Belle,A wedding! That's it! Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac should get married!
Apple Bloom,How is gettin' hitched gonna keep them apart?
Sweetie Belle,They aren't really gonna get married. They're just gonna get ready to get married.
Cheerilee,"[chuckle] No, you, biscuit-wiscuit bear!"
Big McIntosh,"Nope, you, huggy-wuggy snuggy bunny!"
Sweetie Belle,"Hi, Miss Cheerilee, how are you?"
Cheerilee,I have a very special somepony.
Big McIntosh,I have a very special somepony.
Apple Bloom,"Yeah, we noticed."
Sweetie Belle,"Gosh, you two are so in love, the next thing you know, you'll be getting married."
Cheerilee and Big McIntosh,Married?!
Sweetie Belle,That's right. Maaarriiied.
Cheerilee and Big McIntosh,Married...
Apple Bloom,[gagging] Ugh!
Apple Bloom,"'Course, if you're gonna get married, you wanna pick out a really nice diamond for your <U+0096> ugh! <U+0096> shmoopy-doopy, uh, pookie-pie."
Big McIntosh,Diamond!
Cheerilee,[distressed] Shmoopy!
Scootaloo,Don't you think you should start looking for your wedding dress? You'll wanna look your best for your... [straining] honey-bunny snuggle-baby.
Cheerilee,Oh! Dress!
Sweetie Belle,Now we just need to keep them apart. I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied. You two do the same with Big Mac.
Apple Bloom,No problem.
Sweetie Belle,Meet you back at the clubhouse in an hour when this whole mess is over.
Sweetie Belle,This one looks nice. Better try it on though.
Sweetie Belle,"Ten minutes down, fifty minutes to go."
Apple Bloom,No.
Apple Bloom,No.
Apple Bloom,Not that one either.
Apple Bloom,No.
Apple Bloom,"Too... shiny. No. You know, somethin' less... shiny."
Others,"""Karat"": Mmm."
Apple Bloom,Miss Cheerilee deserves the best. How much time is left? I'm runnin' out of ways to make diamonds sound bad.
Scootaloo,We still have twenty five minutes.
Apple Bloom,[sigh] [anxious] Where's my brother?
Others,"""Karat"": He made his purchase and departed out the back. Said something about needing to see his... shmoopy-shmoo."
Scootaloo,Ugh.
Apple Bloom,"Okay, I'll see what I can do to slow him down. You go on to Carousel Boutique and warn Sweetie Belle."
Apple Bloom,Huh<U+0096>
Sweetie Belle,What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom? Where's Big Mac?
Scootaloo,On [gasp] his [grunt] way. Gotta [grunt] keep him [gasp] out of boutique.
Apple Bloom,Huh?
Scootaloo,Move away!
Apple Bloom,He'll get to her! He's too strong!
Sweetie Belle,Let him go!
Big McIntosh,Shmoopy-doo<U+0096> Whoa!
Scootaloo,[sigh] I sure am glad you found those shovels.
Apple Bloom,One more minute and the spell will be broken!
Big McIntosh,Shmoopy-doo!
Cheerilee,Sweetums?!
Big McIntosh,Shmoopy-doo!
Apple Bloom,Aaaa<U+0096>
Apple Bloom,"Oh, please be normal, please be normal."
Cheerilee,Am I wearing a wedding veil?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Cheerilee,Are you sitting on a feather bed in a hole in the ground?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Cheerilee,Girls! Can you explain why I look like I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit?
Sweetie Belle,"We may have given you the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion... that may have turned out to actually be a love poison, and you may have gone just a teeny-tiniest bit nutty."
Apple Bloom,But we only did it because we thought you and Big Mac would be really happy if you could be each others very special someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day.
Scootaloo,Our hearts and hooves were in the right place.
Cheerilee,We appreciate that you care about us and want us to be happy but<U+0096>
Apple Bloom,"But no matter how good our intentions might have been, we shoulda never meddled in your relationship."
Scootaloo,Nopony can force two ponies to be together.
Sweetie Belle,It's up to everypony to choose that very special somepony for themselves.
Others,"Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, We're sorry."
Cheerilee,And you can think about how sorry you are while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores at Sweet Apple Acres. Does that seem like a fair punishment to you?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"Hey there, Miss Cheerilee! What are you doin' here?"
Cheerilee,"Since you three are doing all of his chores, Big Mac and I thought we'd have a picnic at the gazebo. Ready, sugar bear?"
Big McIntosh,"Eeyup, pumpkin pie."
Others,"Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, [gasp] NOOOOO!!!"
Pinkie Pie,Let's do this!
Pinkie Pie,Nailed it!
Pinkie Pie,"Morning, DaisyJo! You here to pick up some cookies to go with your milk?"
DaisyJo,"Oh ya, Pinkie, don'tcha know?"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, Mrs. Cake just baked a fresh batch of your favorite oatmeal."
DaisyJo,"Mooo, sounds delightful!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Rose, your Calla lilies look even better than last year! I bet you'll take first prize at the flower show again."
Rose,"Thanks, Pinkie! Would you like one?"
Pinkie Pie,"Absolutely! [chomps] Looking fit as a fiddle, Mr. Waddle, and you're wearing my favorite tie!"
Mr. Waddle,"Mr. Aw, shucks, Miss Pinkie, you flatterer you."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, happy birthday, Cheerilee."
Cheerilee,"Thank you, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,"Happy day-after-your-birthday, Zecora!"
Zecora,"What a lovely hi, Miss Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie,"And Miss Matilda, happy birthday to you... in one hundred and thirty two days!"
Matilda,Pinkie Pie! How do you remember everything about everypony?
Pinkie Pie,'Cause everypony's my friend and I love to see my friends smile!
Pinkie Pie,My name is Pinkie Pie (Hello!) And I am here to say (How ya doin'?) I'm gonna make you smile and I will brighten up your day It doesn't matter now (What's up?) If you are sad or blue (Howdy!) 'Cause cheering up my friends is just what Pinkie's here to do

Others,I like to see you grin (Awesome!) I love to see you beam (Rock on!) The corners of your mouth turned up is always Pinkie's dream (Hoof bump!) But if you're kind of worried And your face has made a frown I'll work real hard and do my best to turn that sad frown upside down
Others,"'Cause I love to make you grin, grin, grin Yes I do Bust it out from ear to ear let it begin Just give me a joyful grin, grin, grin And you fill me with good cheer"
Others,It's true some days are dark and lonely And maybe you feel sad But Pinkie will be there to show you that it isn't that bad There's one thing that makes me happy and makes my whole life worthwhile And that's when I talk to my friends and get them to smile
Others,I really am so happy Your smile fills me with glee I give a smile I get a smile And that's so special to me

Others,"Come on everypony smile, smile, smile Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine All I really need's a smile, smile, smile From these happy friends of mine"
Choir and Pinkie Pie,"Come on everypony smile, smile, smile Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine All I really need's a smile, smile, smile From these happy friends of mine"
Choir and Pinkie Pie,"Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile"
Pinkie Pie,Come on and smile Come on and smile
Pinkie Pie,I've never seen you before.
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Kid, you're smarter than you look."
Pinkie Pie,"Thanks! I'm Pinkie Pie. What's your name? ""Property of C.D.D."" I'm guessing that last ""D"" is for ""Donkey""."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Quick as a whip, kid."
Pinkie Pie,"Now, how 'bout that ""C""? Hmm... Calvin? Calhoun? Caleb? Carl? Carmine? Carlo? Charlie? Chester? Chico? Claudio? Cletus? Clifford? Coraline? Cornelius? Cortez? Crank? Christopher<U+0096>?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Cranky! It's Cranky, alright?!"
Pinkie Pie,And your middle name?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,[mumbles] Doodle.
Pinkie Pie,I'm sorry?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,[quickly] Doodle.
Pinkie Pie,One more time...!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,[sighs] Doodle.
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey?
Pinkie Pie,You're a Cranky Doodle Donkey guy. A Cranky Doodle Donkey. I never met you but you're my new friend and I'm your best friend Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie,"C'mon now, Doodle, give a smile!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Nopony calls me Doodle!
Pinkie Pie,"What just happened? Meet somepony new, check. Introduce myself, check. Sing random song outta nowhere, check. Become instant best friends... uncheck. I don't get it. How can somepony not become instant best friends with me? Was it something I said? Was it something I sang? This is no time for the blame game, Pinkie! There's somepony new in town, and you need to win him over! 'Try everything you can to make Cranky smile and be your friend'... Check!"
Pinkie Pie,"Alright, Pinkie. If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship, you're gonna have to bring your A game! Let's do this. Howdy-doody, Cranky Doodle! So, uh, are you moving to Ponyville, Cranky?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"What gave you the hint there, kid? The cart full of stuff, maybe?"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, I'd be happy to show you around. It's the least a new friend can do."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Listen, kid, I traveled around Equestria my entire life. I've made many friends. I don't need any more."
Pinkie Pie,Gosh! I could never have too many friends!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Well, why don't you go and make some more?"
Pinkie Pie,But I don't need to go when I can stay and make friends... with you.
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Look, kid, y<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie. All of my friends do."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Look, kid, I came to Ponyville for some peace and quiet and privacy, to be alone with my memories. All I want is to get to my new home and unpack my stuff."
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, what does this bauble do?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Don't touch that!
Pinkie Pie,"Ooooooh, what's this?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Please, don't!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oooh, look at these!"
Pinkie Pie,Eeeheeeheee!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Pinkie! Keep your hooves off my wagon!
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, Cranky. [gasps] [quickly] I promised not to touch your wagon, so I brought one of my own! I use it to welcome folks!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Who'd'a guessed?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,[groans] Let's get this over with.
Pinkie Pie,That's the spirit!
Pinkie Pie,Welcome welcome welcome A fine welcome to you Welcome welcome welcome I say how do you do? Welcome welcome welcome I say hip hip hurray Welcome welcome welcome To Ponyville today
Pinkie Pie,Wait for it!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Noooo!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, silly me! I must've put the confetti in the oven and the cake in the confetti cannons! Again! [giggles] [chomps] Mmm, still delicious! Try some, Cranky, it's sure to make you smile."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Oh, where is it, where is it?"
Pinkie Pie,Where's what? [yelps] Spider! Big hairy spider!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Stop, stop, stop!"
Pinkie Pie,Oh. Was that your wig?
Pinkie Pie,"I can fix this, I can fix this! [through megaphone] Hey, everypony! Does anypony have a toupee?!"
Pinkie Pie,"This donkey is really, really, bald!"
Pinkie Pie,"[through megaphone] What's so funny? This is serious business, everypony! Cranky needs a new wig to cover his hairless head!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,I have had enough!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, you're losing him, Pinkie. Wait, Cranky! Please, let me make it up to you!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,No!
Pinkie Pie,"Ladies, this is a spa emergency. Cranky needs help, STAT."
Pinkie Pie,"Hi, Cranky! I have a gift for you!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,The spa treatment was gift enough.
Pinkie Pie,"It's not going to explode or anything. Promise. Just open it! It's a new toupee! I had my friend Rarity make it. She calls it the ""dreamboat special""."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"This is wonderful. Thanks, kid."
Pinkie Pie,"He's starting to warm up, but still no smile. Hmmm."
Pinkie Pie,"Hey! Whatcha doing there, ol' buddy ol' pal?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,What's it look like?
Pinkie Pie,Looks like a yard sale. I'll give you two bits for this!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"I'm not selling, kid. I'm unpacking."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, why didn't you say so?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,I thought I had.
Pinkie Pie,This is so pretty! Where'd you get it?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Manehattan. Now put it down, gently."
Pinkie Pie,Really? What were you doin' there?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Trying to find a friend.
Pinkie Pie,"Oooh, I'm always trying to find friends, and today I found you. See how good I am at it?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,This was a special friend.
Pinkie Pie,Like me?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"No, you're extra special, kid."
Pinkie Pie,"[to herself] Yes! I'm in! [to Cranky] Woow, where in Equestria did you get this, Cranky?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Fillydelphia.
Pinkie Pie,It's awfully pretty.
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Yes, she was."
Pinkie Pie,Huh?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"I mean, it was<U+0096> I mean, it is. Yes, it's pretty. Now put it down!"
Pinkie Pie,"I wonder where Cranky got this. Huh. Will you look at that? Hey, Cranky! Can I ask you about<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,Oh no!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,What did you say-ayayayayay! What have you done?!
Pinkie Pie,"There! Uh, all better?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"No, not all better, all soggy!"
Pinkie Pie,"I'm sorry, Cranky!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Oh, you're sorry! Well, then, everything is fine!"
Pinkie Pie,...It is?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"No! It isn't! Listen to me, kid, I will never be your friend!"
Pinkie Pie,"Never, or never-ever?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!"
Pinkie Pie,That's four 'evers'. That's like... forever!
Pinkie Pie,I just can't believe it. Cranky said he would never forever be my friend. It was horrible.
Twilight Sparkle,"I know this is hard for you, Pinkie, seeing that you're friends with everypony, but you just have to accept that Cranky is gonna be an exception. He just... doesn't want to be bothered."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics."
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow!
Pinkie Pie,"No, no, it's okay, Twilight. I get what you're saying. What you're both saying. And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone. ...Right after he accepts my apology!"
Pinkie Pie,Cranky!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,No! No! Leave me alone!
Pinkie Pie,Wait! I understand that you don't want me as a friend!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"No, I don't!"
Pinkie Pie,So I just wanted to say 'I'm sorry'!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Fine! You said it!
Pinkie Pie,But do you accept my apology?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,No!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Cranky! Please accept my apology! Please!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,No!
Pinkie Pie,"But I'm really, really, really..."
Pinkie Pie,"...really, really..."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Phew!
Pinkie Pie,"...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really, really... [continues saying ""really"", speed increases until] ...sorry!"
Pinkie Pie,"Cranky, please, please accept my apology! I'd do anything to make it up to you!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,But there's nothing you can do! You ruined my book! You destroyed all I have to remember her by!
Pinkie Pie,Her? Her who? The special friend?
Pinkie Pie,"[muffled] Cranky? It's me again. I understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology... Before I leave you alone forever, I have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"No, I don't want it, kid! Anything you would give me is sure to lead to some sort of disaster!"
Matilda,"[muffled] Goodness, you really are cranky."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,It can't be... Is it really you?
Matilda,"It can, and it is."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Matilda! But how?
Matilda,Pinkie.
Cranky Doodle Donkey,But... I never told you about her!
Pinkie Pie,You didn't have to. I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda.
Cranky Doodle Donkey,What?
Pinkie Pie,"Well, when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend! And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday. Nuh-uh! My birthday isn't for another seventy five days!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Huh?
Pinkie Pie,"And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala! And I knew I recognized all these things."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,But how could you have ever seen them before?
Matilda,Because I also have them in my scrapbook.
Pinkie Pie,And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Oh, Matilda. The night we met at the Gala was the most magical night of my life."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"[voiceover] I couldn't wait to see you again. But when I came to your room the next day, you were gone."
Matilda,[voiceover] Didn't you get my note?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"[voiceover] No, I never got it. Ever since that day I've gone from town to town to town, searching all over Equestria for you..."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,...Until finally I gave up. I came to Ponyville to retire from my search.
Matilda,I was living in Ponyville the whole time. I always hoped that some day you would come and find me... Doodle.
Pinkie Pie,Uh. Matilda? Nopony calls him Doodle.
Cranky Doodle Donkey,Nopony... but Matilda. Mmm.
Pinkie Pie,So does this mean that you accept my apology?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology, and I am honored to call you my friend."
Pinkie Pie,"[explodes like a firework] Woo-hoo! This is just fantastic! Ooh, now we can hang out together and chat and sing songs and [gasps] party! Oh, I have to throw you guys a big party! It'll be called the 'Welcome to Ponyville/I Found My Lost Love/I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie' Party! ...Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Pinkie, we're eternally grateful to you. But... Matilda and I just want to spend some time together in peace and quiet."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh. Um, but we're still friends?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Pinkie, you went way, way, way out of your way to make me happy. Of course we're friends."
Pinkie Pie,Great!
Pinkie Pie,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Pinkie Pie,"There are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship. Some friends like to run and laugh and play together. But others just like to be left alone, and that's fine too. But the best thing about friendship is being able to make your friends smile."
Pinkie Pie,"He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart She's his cranky doodle joy I helped the Cranky Doodle boy, yeah! I helped the Cranky Doodle boy!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey and Matilda,Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie,"Whoops, privacy. Sorry."
Fluttershy,Lunch time! Who's hungry?
Fluttershy,"Here you go, Angel bunny."
Fluttershy,"Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win. Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum-yum-yum!"
Fluttershy,"What? But... Well then, what will you eat? I'm not sure I can even make that. Well... I don't want you to starve... Oh, are you sure I can't tempt you with a nice crisp piece of<U+0096>"
Fluttershy,[sighs] I'll make your special recipe.
Fluttershy,"Hmm, let's see. Asparagus. Excuse me, um, I think you just stepped in front of me? Excuse me, I think you made a mistake? You see I was actually here first and<U+0096>"
Lucy Packard,"Sorry, didn't notice you there."
Fluttershy,I know.
Fluttershy,"Oh, pardon me, sir<U+0096>"
Sand Trap,"Yes, what?"
Fluttershy,I think you just cut in front of me.
Sand Trap,A cut of celery? But<U+0096> this is the asparagus stand!
Fluttershy,I said [into ear trumpet] I think you just cut in front of me.
Sand Trap,"Ohoh, no need, dearie, I'm already in front!"
Fluttershy,I noticed.
Others,"""Turf"": [fades in] ...And I was like, 'Oh, wow.'"
Fluttershy,Hey!
Others,"""Turf"": Would you mind moving back? You're in my personal space."
Fluttershy,But<U+0096>
Others,"""Surf"": Seriously, do you need your asparagus so badly? Get a life."
Fluttershy,"Oh, okay. There's no rush."
Rarity,"Fluttershy, you mustn't let them treat you that way."
Fluttershy,"Oh, it's-it's really no big deal..."
Pinkie Pie,It's bigger than big. It's double big. You are a pony with a problem.
Fluttershy,"What problem? Oh, go right ahead, Pinkie Pie. You first."
Pinkie Pie,Right there! That's the problem.
Rarity,You've got to stop being such a doormat.
Fluttershy,A doormat?
Rarity,"A pushover, darling. You've got to stand up for yourself, promise us."
Fluttershy,"Oh, okay. I promise. Oh! Good!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, that's okay, I don't mind."
Rarity,"Watch and learn. Hold it right there, Mister small and handsome."
Gizmo,"Uh, who, me?"
Rarity,"Oh, of course you. Nopony ever called you handsome before?"
Gizmo,"Uhh, that'd be a big no."
Rarity,"Oh, well, they should! How about flexing some of your muscles for me? [gasps] Oh, my heavens! Do you think a strong, handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus?"
Gizmo,[mumbles] Nuhh.
Rarity,"See, that's not so hard, is it?"
Fluttershy,Um... I guess not.
Rarity,Alright then! What else is on your list?
Fluttershy,Let's see... I also need tomatoes.
Fluttershy,Here you go.
Others,"""Roma"": [clears throat] That'll be two bits. Not one."
Fluttershy,"Oh, but last week, it was only one bit."
Others,"""Roma"": That was then, this is now."
Fluttershy,"Oh, okay. I don't wanna argue about it."
Pinkie Pie,What do you think you're doing?
Others,"""Roma"": Mindin' my own business, maybe you should try it."
Pinkie Pie,Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous. One bit is the right price.
Others,"""Roma"": I say it's two bits."
Pinkie Pie,One bit.
Others,"""Roma"": Two bits!"
Pinkie Pie,One bit!
Others,"""Roma"": Two bits!"
Pinkie Pie,One bit!
Others,"""Roma"": Two bits!"
Pinkie Pie,Two bits!
Others,"""Roma"": One bit!"
Pinkie Pie,Two bits!
Others,"""Roma"": One bit!"
Pinkie Pie,I insist it's two bits or nothing!
Others,"""Roma"": One bit and that's my final offer!"
Pinkie Pie,"Have it your way, one bit it is!"
Pinkie Pie,See? Asserting yourself can be fun!
Fluttershy,I guess you're right!
Rarity,"So, Fluttershy, do you feel like giving it a try?"
Fluttershy,"Um... okay. [to self] I need that cherry. [to Crafty Crate] Boy, am I glad you have one cherry left. You see, I'm making this special meal for my bunny Angel. He's a very picky eater, and the recipe calls for a cherry on top."
Fluttershy,Here you go.
Crafty Crate,"So, you say you need this cherry 'very badly'."
Fluttershy,"Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!"
Crafty Crate,Then it'll be ten bits!
Fluttershy,"Ten?! Oh, hey, mister handsome, I know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong, and big, handsome, strong guys are always nice to everypony, right?"
Crafty Crate,Ten bits for the cherry.
Fluttershy,Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous! I insist on paying you... eleven bits!
Crafty Crate,Eleven bits?
Fluttershy,"Umm...I mean, nine bits!"
Crafty Crate,"Er, now wait a minute."
Fluttershy,"Okay, twelve bits, but that's my final offer!"
Crafty Crate,I think you're confused.
Fluttershy,"It's twelve bits, take it or leave it."
Crafty Crate,"Okay, I'll take it!"
Pinkie Pie,Don't give him your money! One cherry is not worth twelve bits!
Fluttershy,But... I was only doing what you did.
Rarity,"It was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away."
Fluttershy,But... I can't let Angel starve! He won't eat it unless I make it just right! I need that cherry no matter what it costs!
Crafty Crate,"In that case, twenty bits!"
Fluttershy,"Twenty?! Oh, but, I don't have that much!"
Crafty Crate,Then why're you wasting my time?
Lemon Hearts,I'll give you two bits for that cherry!
Crafty Crate,"Sold! Eh, tough break, kid. Next time, don't be such a doormat."
Fluttershy,"Ta-da! Here you go, Angel. Sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted. Angel? [sighs] Look at me... I really am a doormat. ""The incredible Iron Will turns doormats into dynamos. Assertiveness seminar today, hedge maze centre."" As Celestia is my witness, I'm never gonna be a pushover again!"
Iron Will,"[kissing] Welcome, friends! My name is Iron Will, and today is the first day of your new life! I wanna hear you stomp if you're tired of being a pushover!"
Iron Will,Stomp if you're tired of being a doormat!
Iron Will,Stomp if you wanna pay nothing for this seminar!
Iron Will,"That's no joke, friends. Iron Will is so confident that you will be one hundred percent satisfied with Iron Will's assertiveness techniques, that if you are not one hundred percent satisfied, you. Pay. Nothing. But I pity the fool who doubts Iron Will's methods! You don't doubt me, do you?"
Meadow Song,"Uh-uh, no sir..."
Iron Will,"That, my friends, is your first lesson. ""Don't be shy; look 'em in the eye."""
Iron Will,"Now, to demonstrate that Iron Will's techniques will work for anypony, I'm gonna need a volunteer."
Iron Will,You in the back row!
Fluttershy,"Who, me?"
Iron Will,"Yes, you! Iron Will wants you onstage!"
Fluttershy,"[gulps] Uh, well..."
Iron Will,Now!
Fluttershy,[whispering] Okay.
Iron Will,Whoaa! He's blocking your path. What are you gonna do about it?
Fluttershy,"Um, politely walk around him?"
Iron Will,No.
Fluttershy,Gingerly tip-toe around him?
Iron Will,No!
Fluttershy,Go back home and try again tomorrow?
Iron Will,"No! ""When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"""
Fluttershy,Oh! Sorry.
Iron Will,"Don't be sorry! Be assertive! ""Never apologize when you can criticize."" [clears throat] why don't you watch where you're going!? Now, you try."
Fluttershy,"Uh... next time, get out of the way before... I bump into you, 'cause... I totally won't be sorry when I do!"
Iron Will,"You see my friends!? If my techniques can work for this shy, little pony, then they can work for anypony!"
Fluttershy,"Okay, I feel good. I feel ready to ""attack the day"", as Iron Will says."
Fluttershy,"Excuse me, Mr. Greenhooves, but I-I think you might be over-watering my petunias..."
Fluttershy,...again.
Fluttershy,"""Treat me like a pushover, and you'll get the once over."""
Mr. Greenhooves,"Mr. Hm? Hmm... [coughs and sputters] Well, perhaps that is enough water."
Fluttershy,Thank you. [excited giggle] I can't believe it worked!
Cherry Berry,Showpony business is tough.
Sweetie Drops,"Go ahead, try one of your jokes out on me. I laugh at everything."
Cherry Berry,"Okay, okay, okay. A donkey and a mule are stuck on a desert island..."
Fluttershy,[clears throat] Excuse me? Would you mind moving your carts so I can pass?
Cherry Berry,"Yeah yeah, in a minute, I just wanna finish up this story. And so the donkey says to the mule<U+0096>"
Fluttershy,"A-hemmmm, can you move? You're blocking my path."
Cherry Berry,"Yeah yeah, in a minute! So the donkey says to the mule... [fades under] (Why don't we build a boat to get off this island? [laughs])"
Fluttershy,"""When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"""
Cherry Berry,...and the mule says<U+0096>
Cherry Berry,"Ugh! Easy does it, lady. We're moving, okay?"
Fluttershy,Good!
Pinkie Pie,Who's next please? And what can I get for you today?
Fluttershy,What do you think you're doing?! Didn't you see me?
Shoeshine,"Uh, I guess maybe."
Fluttershy,"'Maybe'? ""Maybes are for babies!"" [growling] Now go to the back of the line where you belong!"
Pinkie Pie,"Heyyy, look at you!"
Rarity,"Oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous."
Pinkie Pie,Looks like that monster's workshop really paid off!
Fluttershy,"Iron Will's not a monster. He's a minotaur, and a true inspiration. His techniques really work."
Rarity,"Well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself. You truly are a whole new Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,Yes I am. And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new Fluttershy.
Fluttershy,"""You laugh at me, I wrath at you!"""
Fluttershy,"Bye, girls. What a day. Taxi! Oh no you don't. ""Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!"""
Royal Riff,Aieeeeee! Ow...
Fluttershy,Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around! [screams] Nopony!
Pinkie Pie,Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure new Fluttershy is such a good idea after all.
Rarity,Old Rarity agrees.
Fluttershy,"You got this, new Fluttershy! This day is yours! And nopony's gonna take it away from you! Am I right?! Right! What?! He's delivered the wrong mail, again!"
Others,"""Mr. Zippy"": Oh<U+0096>"
Fluttershy,And new Fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.
Others,"""Mr. Zippy"": Ohh, did I mix 'em up again? Sorry about that."
Fluttershy,"""You apologize, I penalize!"""
Others,"""Mr. Zippy"": Oh!"
Globe Trotter,"Excuse me, do you know how to get to the Ponyville tower?"
Globe Trotter,"Oh, that's a shame."
Fluttershy,"[growls] ""You make me lose, I blow my fuse!"""
Globe Trotter,Hey!
Rarity,Fluttershy! What are you doing?! That's no way to behave!
Fluttershy,Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy? And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!
Rarity,"No, sweetie, he didn't. We saw the whole thing. We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far."
Fluttershy,What?! You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy! But old Fluttershy is gone!
Pinkie Pie,New Fluttershy? Old Fluttershy!?
Rarity,What happened to nice Fluttershy? We want that Fluttershy back.
Fluttershy,"No, you want wimp Fluttershy. You want pushover Fluttershy. You want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!"
Pinkie Pie,Nyaaaaah! Too many Fluttershys to keep track of! Make it stop!
Fluttershy,"Things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?"
Rarity,"Now, stop right there! Let's not let things descend into petty insults!"
Fluttershy,"Why not? I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity. With your 'petty' concerns about fashion."
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, leave her alone! Fashion is her passion!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, and what are you passionate about? Birthday cake? Party hats? I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!"
Pinkie Pie,[starts crying] Looks like nasty Fluttershy is here to stay!
Rarity,[starts crying] I cannot believe what that monster Iron Will has done to you!
Fluttershy,"Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur! [growls] [whimper] I'm the monster."
Rarity,"[knocks, clears throat] Fluttershy, are you in there?"
Pinkie Pie,It's Pinkie Pie and Rarity!
Fluttershy,[muffled] Go away! Go away before nasty Fluttershy strikes again!
Rarity,"Oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret."
Pinkie Pie,We did?
Rarity,Shh.
Fluttershy,"[muffled] Pinkie's right. I'm the only one to blame. [normal] But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again. Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away."
Rarity,"[muffled] Sweetie, [normal] Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I. You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character."
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty. What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony."
Rarity,Yes! [muffled] You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it.
Fluttershy,"I-I'm not sure I can. I'm too far gone. Whenever I try to assert myself, I become a monster."
Rarity,"Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster."
Pinkie Pie,"No, but he is."
Iron Will,"Iron Will's my name, training ponies is my game."
Rarity,What a darling little catchphrase.
Iron Will,"Your friend Fluttershy loved Iron Will's catchphrases. Word on the street is that she doesn't take no guff from nopony! So, Iron Will is here to collect Iron Will's fee."
Pinkie Pie,Fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep!
Rarity,"[gasps] I'm sure a big, brave, powerful, and rich monster<U+0096> I mean, minotaur like you doesn't need that money right away. You can afford to come back later."
Iron Will,Are you kidding? Fluttershy is overdue as it is. Iron Will collects now.
Rarity,Do something!
Pinkie Pie,"We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now. Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures. Uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?"
Iron Will,Iron Will does have some grocery shopping to do. Iron Will will come back this afternoon.
Pinkie Pie,But that's only half a day. We need one full day at least.
Iron Will,Iron Will will delay for half a day and no longer!
Pinkie Pie,A full day!
Iron Will,Half day!
Pinkie Pie,Full day!
Iron Will,Half day!
Pinkie Pie,Half day!
Iron Will,Full day!
Pinkie Pie,We need half a day and no more!
Iron Will,"Well, you'll get a full day and no less!"
Pinkie Pie,Okie-dokie. See you tomorrow.
Iron Will,"Wait, what?"
Iron Will,"Huh, sounds like the search won't be necessary. Iron Will collects now."
Pinkie Pie,But we had an agreement! You gotta come back tomorrow!
Iron Will,"""When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"""
Iron Will,"[snorts] You were nothing but a doormat, and Iron Will turned you into a lean, mean, assertive machine! Now, pay Iron Will what you owe Iron Will!"
Fluttershy,"Um, no."
Iron Will,What did you say?
Fluttershy,No.
Fluttershy,"As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing. Well, I'm not satisfied."
Iron Will,What do you mean you're not satisfied?! Everypony has always been satisfied!
Fluttershy,"Well, I guess I'm the first then. But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay. It's as simple as that."
Iron Will,"Ohh, are you... sure you're not just a little bit satisfied? B-because maybe... we could cut a deal. I-I mean we're both reasonable creatures, aren't we?"
Fluttershy,"I'm sorry, but no means no."
Iron Will,"No means no, huh? Nopony's ever said that to me before. Huh... I gotta remember that one. That's a good catchphrase for my next workshop."
Pinkie Pie,"You were amazing, Fluttershy! You totally stood up to that monster!"
Rarity,"In fact, you didn't change at all! You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved!"
Pinkie Pie,The one we missed!
Fluttershy,"Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good. I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far. Friends?"
Pinkie Pie and Rarity,Friends.
Fluttershy,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Fluttershy,"Sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself, and when I first tried it, I didn't like the pony I became. But I've learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. Now I know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant or mean."
Spike,"[sighs] I made it for you, Rarity. Why, yes, it is an ice cream house. Chocolate fudge shingles... rocky road garage..."
Spike,Huh? Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, hi, Spike!"
Spike,It's the middle of the night! Why are you pacing like this?
Twilight Sparkle,"Frankly, I don't know how you can sleep at a time like this!"
Spike,Three A.M.?
Twilight Sparkle,"It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!"
Spike,Eh... I don't understand. What's wrong?
Twilight Sparkle,Here. Now do you see what's wrong?
Spike,We forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?
Twilight Sparkle,"No, the problem is I just finished planning my schedule for the month, but I forgot to leave time to plan for next month! Don't you see? There's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule! I could move my meeting with the Ponyville Hay Board to the following Tuesday, but then I have to reschedule my lunch with Pinkie Pie, and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling. This is an absolute disaster. My whole year could be thrown off!"
Spike,And I woke up from an ice cream dream for this...
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, my gosh, I think I did it! If I can find a way to read ""The Art of Invisibility Spells"" and ""Thornhoof's Brief History of Canterlot"" at the same time, that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window! Huh?"
Future Twilight Sparkle,"Twilight, you've got to listen to me!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!"
Future Twilight Sparkle,"Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!"
Twilight Sparkle,You're from the future?!
Future Twilight Sparkle,"That's right, now listen<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,What happened to you? The future must be awful.
Future Twilight Sparkle,Please! I don't have much time!
Twilight Sparkle,Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
Future Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?"
Future Twilight Sparkle,The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,Really? Where? I've never seen them.
Future Twilight Sparkle,"They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to<U+0096>"
Future Twilight Sparkle,"I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start until the party supplies get there!"
Fluttershy,[grunts] Happy to... help... but... can I carry... the balloons next time?
Fluttershy,Oh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Listen, everypony! I've got something really important to say!"
Twilight Sparkle,This is no laughing matter! We have a crisis on our hooves!
Twilight Sparkle,I've just been visited by myself from the future!
Twilight Sparkle,This isn't a joke! My future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next Tuesday morning!
Applejack,What kind of disaster?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know! I got sucked back into the future before I could explain!
Pinkie Pie,Run for your liiiiiiiife!
Rarity,"What ever should we do, Twilight? How do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is?"
Twilight Sparkle,"We'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe. Rainbow Dash, you and the other Pegasi spread out over Equestria, and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster, and I mean anything."
Rainbow Dash,You got it!
Twilight Sparkle,Everypony else<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,"Everypony else, time to disaster-proof Equestria!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Twilight Sparkle,"Done, and done, and done. Applejack, what about the Everfree Forest?"
Applejack,The perimeter's clear.
Twilight Sparkle,Great.
Rainbow Dash,And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.
Twilight Sparkle,"Excellent. Well, we've done everything on the list, but still... Future Twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal. I just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes."
Spike,What is that thing?!
Twilight Sparkle,"That's Cerberus! He's supposed to be guarding the gates of Tartarus. But if he's here, then all the ancient evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy Equestria!"
Spike,Destroy Equestria?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah! Isn't it great? Hey, Cerberus! You look like you could use some obedience training! Magic obedience training!"
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Fluttershy,Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, I knew you were good with animals, but this is amazing!"
Fluttershy,"Aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all. Right, Cerberus? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie.
Pinkie Pie,"[stops screaming] Yes, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,Do you have a ball I can borrow?
Pinkie Pie,"I have balls stashed all over Ponyville, in case of ball emergency."
Twilight Sparkle,"[sing-song voice] Hey, Cerberus! Look what I have!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I'll be back as soon as I've returned him to the gates of Tartarus. Once he's back at home, there'll be no disaster."
Spike,[yawns] I wish Twilight would go on epic adventures more often. Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.
Spike,"Hey, Twilight. How'd it go with Cerberus?"
Twilight Sparkle,Great. I got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape.
Twilight Sparkle,[yelps] Oh no!
Spike,"What's the big deal, it's just a 'lost dog' flyer. I guess the Princess hasn't heard we found Cerberus yet."
Twilight Sparkle,"It's not that, it's this!"
Spike,"A paper cut? Come on, Twilight, you really need to toughen up. Just clean it out and you'll be fine."
Twilight Sparkle,The cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future Twilight's cheek! We haven't changed the future at all! The disaster is still coming!
Twilight Sparkle,"If the disaster wasn't caused by Cerberus getting loose, then what could it possibly be?"
Spike,"[laughs] I dunno, but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest. You've worn a groove into the floor!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't have time for another one of your lectures, Spike! This is serious!"
Spike,My lectures?
Twilight Sparkle,I did everything I could think of to change the future. But it didn't work. So maybe it's not what I do... Maybe it's what I don't do!
Spike,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"If I stand right here and don't move a muscle until next Tuesday, I can't possibly do whatever it is that future Twilight wanted to warn me not to do!"
Spike,"Really? So... no matter what happens, you're not gonna move a muscle, huh? Then maybe you won't mind if I... eat an entire tub of ice cream!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[through gritted teeth] Spike, stop! Think of the stomach ache!"
Spike,"[chuckles] Stomach ache, huh? That's future Spike's problem."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Twilight, another Pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear and<U+0096> [laughs] What's going on? Aren't you gonna stop him?"
Spike,"She sure isn't! In fact, she's not gonna move 'til next Tuesday! She thinks it'll prevent the disaster from happening!"
Rainbow Dash,"[laughs] Oh, this is too rich. [gasps] Hey, Twilight! There's a mouse right behind you!"
Rainbow Dash,Oh no!
Twilight Sparkle,What happened?
Spike,I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! It was a total accident!
Twilight Sparkle,Show me.
Rainbow Dash,Uhhh... I'm not so sure that's a<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,Show me! Oh no! This is the same mane cut as future Twilight!
Rainbow Dash,Y'know... it really doesn't look too bad...
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't care how it looks! It's just another sign that the future hasn't changed! Not doing anything didn't work either! Oh, I wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so I could stop it!"
Spike,You wanna see the future? I might know somepony who can help!
Twilight Sparkle,What's this?
Spike,It's Madame Pinkie's place.
Twilight Sparkle,Madame Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie,"[spookily] Come... Enter the chamber of Madame Pinkie Pie... For the answers you seek, let us consult the mystical orb of fate's destiny... [normal] Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny? I just got it. Cool, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, uh... best one I've seen."
Pinkie Pie,"[spookily] Look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all! Ah, yes, I see something... It is a vision of the future... I see... you, Twilight. You will get a really cool birthday present next year..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, and?"
Pinkie Pie,That's it.
Twilight Sparkle,Are you sure?
Pinkie Pie,Yep. Cool birthday present.
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future Twilight was trying to warn me about!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, my fortunetelling has nothing to do with my Pinkie Sense, silly. It's only good for vague and immediate events."
Pinkie Pie,"Like that, see? Where did that even come from?"
Pinkie Pie,"Lalalalalalala, lalalala... Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight since the flowerpot incident. Hope she still isn't mad. Uhhhh..."
Twilight Sparkle,Off by point zero two from yesterday. Carry the fifteen... Negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...
Spike,Hey Pinkie.
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she?"
Spike,"Who cares? As long as I can keep eating ice cream. Sorry, future Spike."
Pinkie Pie,[to Twilight] Are... you okay?
Twilight Sparkle,"Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here. Can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine-and-quarter catadioptric telescopes?"
Pinkie Pie,Sure!
Twilight Sparkle,"So I was thinking, after I came to see Madame Pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my head<U+0097>see the bandage? Just like the bandage from the future..."
Pinkie Pie,Nice!
Twilight Sparkle,"I had an epiphany after that flowerpot. Doing things didn't work, not doing things didn't work, and I couldn't predict the future either, so I only had one other choice. Monitor everything."
Pinkie Pie,Makes sense to me!
Twilight Sparkle,"That way no matter what happens in the future, I'll be ready! I thought I saw something last night in the Horsehead Nebula, but after staring at it for three straight hours I realized, I was wrong!"
Pinkie Pie,Three hours? But when did you sleep?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I didn't sleep. I haven't slept since future Twilight was here. There are only three days left until next Tuesday, I can sleep all I want after that!"
Spike,"You've been awake too long, Twilight."
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now, Tuesday's tomorrow!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Pinkie, did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine-and-quarter-inch catadioptric telescopes?"
Pinkie Pie,I have no idea!
Twilight Sparkle,Ah! My eye!
Pinkie Pie,"Don't worry, Twilight, I have eye patches stashed all over Ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency. There! Now you look like a pirate! A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut."
Twilight Sparkle,"The eye patch...! Another sign! Nearly all the signs have come true! I haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe! If Tuesday's tomorrow, and the disaster happens by Tuesday morning, then there's only one solution. I'll just have to... stop time!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] Okay, the Canterlot archives are right over there. Let's move!"
Spike,"Uhh... I don't think we need to sneak around, Twilight. It's not illegal to walk around Canterlot."
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] Guard! C'mon, you guys! [exhales] That was close."
Spike,"I dunno why we have to wear these things, either."
Pinkie Pie,Aren't we wearing them for fun?
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] No, there's nothing fun about this!"
Pinkie Pie,Oh... Are you sure?
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] Focus, guys! The only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time! Time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing, the most secure section of the archives. That's why we're sneaking around!"
Pinkie Pie,Awesome! That sounds fun!
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] No, it's not fun!"
Pinkie Pie,Aww.
Pinkie Pie,I still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present.
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] The coast is clear. Now slowly lift me into the window so we can<U+0096> AH!
Spike,[sighs] Let's get this over with.
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] Okay, if my calculations are correct, the Star Swirl the Bearded wing should be right... here."
Spike,"Uh, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] What is it, Spike?"
Spike,Isn't this where we came in?
Pinkie Pie,Cool! Can we climb in the window again? That was super fun!
Twilight Sparkle,I don't understand. It's supposed to be right here... How are we supposed to find it now?
Pinkie Pie,Maybe we should ask somepony in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?
Twilight Sparkle,Huh. How'd I miss that? Look at all those priceless magic scrolls. There are more than I ever imagined!
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, the guard!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] What do we do, what do we do?!"
Guard,"Hey, Twilight, haven't seen you in a while. Let me open that for ya."
Twilight Sparkle,[chuckles nervously] Thanks!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh no!
Spike,Oof!
Pinkie Pie,Oh!
Twilight Sparkle,Look! I look just like future Twilight... The last sign has come true!
Pinkie Pie,"And that's bad, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,Come on! It's almost Tuesday morning! The disaster could happen at any moment!
Spike,But how do we find the time-stopping spell? There must be a million scrolls here!
Twilight Sparkle,I. Don't. Know!
Spike,"Twilight, it's over! It's officially Tuesday morning."
Twilight Sparkle,"Nnngh, no! Tuesday morning, the disaster! Incoming!"
Spike,"I dunno, Twilight. I don't see any disasters. Looks like a pretty nice day."
Princess Celestia,"Good morning, Twilight. Love the new hairstyle. Well, happy Tuesday!"
Twilight Sparkle,Why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here?! Is it possible there never was a disaster? That I've just been making myself frantic over nothing?!
Spike,"I don't get it. If future Twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster, then what was she trying to tell you?"
Twilight Sparkle,[giggles] I don't know. But I do know one thing. I look ridiculous.
Spike,"Yeah, you do!"
Twilight Sparkle,"And it's all because I couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself! Well, not anymore. From now on, I'm gonna solve problems as they come, and stop worrying about every little thing!"
Spike,That's great! Does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing?
Twilight Sparkle,"No more late night pacing. If only I had learned this lesson a week ago, we wouldn't have had to go through all this."
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, Twilight, I found something! It doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time. It says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments. Does that help?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, you're a genius!"
Pinkie Pie,Woo-hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,Now I can go back and tell past Twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come!
Twilight Sparkle,"Twilight, you've got to listen to me!"
Past Twilight Sparkle,"Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!"
Past Twilight Sparkle,You're from the future?!
Twilight Sparkle,"That's right, now listen<U+0096>"
Past Twilight Sparkle,What happened to you? The future must be awful.
Twilight Sparkle,Please! I don't have much time!
Past Twilight Sparkle,Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!"
Past Twilight Sparkle,"I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?"
Twilight Sparkle,The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not<U+0096>
Past Twilight Sparkle,Really? Where? I've never seen them.
Twilight Sparkle,"They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,"I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,<U+0096>waste your time... worrying... about... Ugh! I can't believe I just did that!
Pinkie Pie,Did you tell her about the cool birthday present?
Twilight Sparkle,Remember last week when future Twilight came to warn me about something? That was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much! Now I'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist! Ugh...
Pinkie Pie,"Ah, don't worry about it. It's past Twilight's problem now."
Twilight Sparkle,"[giggles] Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie."
Spike,"[stomach growls] Ohhh... my stomach... I, I think it's all that ice cream... I thought the stomach ache would be future Spike's problem... but now I am future Spike. Ohh..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, future Spike. Let's get you home."
Twilight Sparkle,"C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!"
Fluttershy,"There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes! Fun, no!"
Twilight Sparkle,"But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?"
Fluttershy,"Now that you put it that way, yes!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Aw, Fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out."
Fluttershy,"Miss out on what? Dragons? Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?"
Twilight Sparkle,Well... yeah!
Fluttershy,"Thanks, but... no thanks!"
Rainbow Dash,"Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me! You owe me!"
Fluttershy,I... said... no!
Rainbow Dash,Yeaagh! Ugh!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time."
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] I don't see any dragons.
Applejack,[hushed] Me neither.
Pinkie Pie,Me neither neither.
Rainbow Dash,"Shoot! You don't think we missed them, do you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] No, I don't think so. We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are. This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!"
Rarity,Yoo-hoo! Well?
Rarity,What do you think? Am I the toast of the trench or what?
Applejack,"[hushed] You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup."
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?"
Rarity,Nice is an understatement. I look fabulous! Who says camouflage has to be drab?
Pinkie Pie,"[hushed] Ahoy, maties! Dragons ho!"
Main cast,Oooh... Ahhhh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, amazing!"
Rainbow Dash,"Pfft, pretty lame move. Is that all they've got?"
Applejack,"[hushed] What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash? Still think they're lame?"
Rainbow Dash,"[hushed] Uh, not so much. The word 'fierce' comes to mind."
Rarity,[hushed] And 'formidable'.
Pinkie Pie,[hushed] And 'super-duper scary'!
Spike,Yeah. Us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with.
Rainbow Dash,"[laughs] Yeah, right, Spike. That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen!"
Spike,What's wrong with wearing an apron? You won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales. Feathers. That's one tough stain!
Rarity,"You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash! Spike's style is unique. He doesn't have to look like other dragons."
Twilight Sparkle,Or act like them.
Rarity,My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is.
Spike,I don't act like other dragons?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, not even close!"
Applejack,"But why would you want to, Spike?"
Rarity,Yes. You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of.
Spike,What's that?
Rarity,The cutest widdle chubby cheeks! Ooooo!
Spike,Cute?! Dragons aren't supposed to be cute! Right?
Rarity,"Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red. It is most becoming."
Spike,Rrrgh!
Rarity,"Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?"
Spike,Waddle?! Rrrrrggggh!
Spike,What am I? Where am I from? Who am I supposed to be?
Twilight Sparkle,"Uuugh! I don't know! For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg. I don't know who found you or where they found you."
Spike,Seriously? That's all you know?
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Spike."
Spike,That doesn't tell me anything about who I am! I need answers! I feel like I'm... I'm looking at a complete stranger. Oh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike. Why don't we do some late-night research? See what we can find out."
Spike,Really? You'd do that?
Twilight Sparkle,Of course! I'm sure we can find something.
Twilight Sparkle,Nothing. Nothing in this one either!
Spike,Nothing at all about dragons? This is getting ridiculous!
Twilight Sparkle,"I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!"
Spike,I wonder if dragons cry...
Twilight Sparkle,"Aw, Spike."
Spike,"It's okay, Twilight. I'm gonna discover who I am if it's the last thing I do!"
Rarity,Yoo-hoo!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, guys!"
Spike,Waugh!
Rarity,Good morning!
Rainbow Dash,Ya wanna join us for breakfast?
Twilight Sparkle,That sounds great. I'm famished.
Spike,Count me out. I've gotta get an early start!
Rarity,An early start?
Spike,Yes! I'm going on a quest of self-discovery! I need to learn what it means to be a dragon! And the only way I'm gonna do that is to join the dragon migration!
Others,"Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, What?!?"
Rainbow Dash,"Spike, that's nonsense talk! I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business! They're big, and tough, and scary..."
Spike,"And I'm small, and meek... and I like to wear aprons. See? This is exactly why I need to spend time with them."
Rainbow Dash,All I'm saying is that you could get hurt.
Rarity,"Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash. I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutesy-wutesy head!"
Spike,"I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind."
Rarity,"Oh, uh, quick, do something! Stop him before it's too late!"
Spike,Ngh! Hey! Give it back!
Twilight Sparkle,Hold it!
Spike,Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Aaagh!
Spike,Really?
Rainbow Dash,Don't tell me you think he should go?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, Spike. I couldn't answer your questions. My books couldn't either. I understand why you want to look elsewhere. I truly believe you need to go on this quest. And we have no right to stop you."
Rarity,I suppose not.
Rainbow Dash,"I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things."
Others,"Rarity, We know."
Rainbow Dash,[under her breath] Rrgh.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike. We can't wait to hear about it when you return."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, we hope your trip<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,Quest.
Rainbow Dash,"<U+0096>your quest answers some of your pesky ""Who am I?"" questions."
Spike,"Thanks, everypony. I know it will."
Rarity,"Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!"
Rainbow Dash,"Go get 'em, big guy!"
Twilight Sparkle,We have faith in you!
Rarity,"[through her grin] We're following him, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,[through her grin] Of course.
Spike,Ugh!
Spike,Nngh...
Spike,"Alright, teenage dragons! Now that's more my speed. And size."
Rainbow Dash,"I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!"
Rarity,"Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous, one of my finer creations."
Twilight Sparkle,"Shh! [hushed] We'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon! Now come on, let's go!"
Spike,"Um, excuse me? Uh, hi. I'm Spike."
Fume,You sure your name is Spike and not Shrimp?!
Spike,"No, it's Spike! I'm not, I mean, I'm sure about that..."
Others,"""Clump"": You look more like Peewee to me."
Others,"""Clump"": You fly in on your mommy's back during the migration?"
Spike,Not exactly...
Fume,"No, no, can't you see baby Spike just hatched? I bet he still sucks his claw at night!"
Spike,"No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!"
Garble,"Well, if you weren't just hatched, how come we haven't seen you around before?"
Spike,"Oh, well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and<U+0096>"
Garble,"Hahaha! Ponyville? That explains it! I knew there was something vaguely pony-ish about you! If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were part pony!"
Spike,"Who, me? I'm not part pony! I'm all dragon, see? Raar!"
Garble,Or maybe you're a pony in a dragon costume.
Twilight Sparkle,[deep voice] Aheh... yeah... hilarious.
Spike,"Nnh, I am a real dragon!"
Garble,"Oh, yeah? Prove it."
Spike,Well... how?
Garble,By acting like one! Who's up for a little belching contest?
Garble,"You think you can beat that, Peewee?"
Teenage dragons,Huh?
Garble,"From the desk of Princess Celestia. Dear Spike, please te<U+0096> Ha! Get this, guys! Spike's pen-pals with a namby-pamby pony princess!"
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] How can he just throw that away?! That letter could be something important!
Rainbow Dash,"We can't worry about that now, Twilight. We're here to help Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I know, I know!"
Twilight Sparkle,There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way!
Garble,Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed.
Spike,Uh...
Teenage dragons,Yeah!
Garble,Ready... go!
Garble,The winner!
Spike,Good old tail wrestling...
Rarity,We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them! He'll get clobbered!
Twilight Sparkle,Let's go! [deep voice] I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!
Garble,Who's this weirdo?
Fume,I think he's Crackle's cousin.
Crackle,BWAAGH!
Garble,"Oh, that would explain it. Ready? Go!"
Garble,Spike's the winner!
Garble,"Nice going, little Spike! Maybe you are a dragon after all!"
Spike,Yeah! Maybe I am!
Rarity,"Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked. Ow."
Spike,"Alright, who's next?"
Garble,"Getting a little cocky, huh? I like that. So how about you wrestle... him! Go!"
Spike,Whooooooooa!
Garble,"So, Spike, you haven't exactly proven yourself as a dragon yet, have you?"
Spike,But... I get an A for effort?
Garble,"Huh, maybe. Let's see how you do in this next contest."
Spike,Whaaaaa! Oof! Wha! Oah! Oof!
Garble,King of the hoard!
Spike,This is my chance.
Rainbow Dash,Not so fast!
Twilight Sparkle,Oof!
Others,"""Clump"" Whoa!"
Spike,King of the ho- whoa! Oof! Uh! Nuh! Oof!
Garble,"Looks like this is another fail for you, little Spike. Can't wait to watch you fail at lava cannonball, too."
Garble,Whoever makes the biggest lava splash is the ultimate dragon! Geronimo!
Spike,Nuh!
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] Spike's on his own this time.
Others,"""Clump"": Cannonball!"
Spike,Guh!
Garble,"What's wrong, Spike? You afraid the lava will hurt your soft pony hide?"
Teenage dragons,Oooh...
Spike,Ugh... Was I... that bad?
Garble,"No, dude. That was awesome! No pony could live through a belly flop like that! [chuckles] You're one tough little dragon."
Garble,"Spike, by belly flopping so hard, you have proven yourself worthy. I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon', and will now perform the initiation ritual. Rrrrgh. [chuckles] Now let's party dragon style!"
Spike,"Man, was that a great party."
Garble,"Great? Huh, maybe by Ponyville standards. Stick with us, Spike. We still got plenty to teach you about being a dragon."
Spike,"I'm not going anywhere. The way I feel right now, I could hang out with you guys forever."
Others,"Rainbow Dash, Forever?!"
Rarity,Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons? Forever?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh no, this is terrible!"
Rainbow Dash,I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance!
Twilight Sparkle,"No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault! I encouraged him to go!"
Garble,"Y'know, Spike, I think you just might be ready for a real dragon raid."
Garble,"There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby, and we're gonna swipe 'em!"
Others,"""Clump"": Aren't you totally psyched to go on this raid?"
Spike,"Oh yeah, I'm excited. I mean, I'm psyched."
Garble,Alright then. Let's fly!
Spike,"Uh, sorry, guys! I guess I'll meet you back here at the crater! After the whole raid thing's over? We'll totally hang then! Whoahoa!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh no, they took Spike! We've gotta go after them!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[yelps] Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!"
Rarity,And you're ruining my fabulous costume!
Rainbow Dash,"I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!"
Garble,"Alright, Spike. Since you're our rookie dragon, you get to lure the parents away from the nest."
Spike,Heh... Lucky me...
Garble,"Well go on, then!"
Spike,"Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Phoenix! I was hoping I could have a word with you? Um, I'd, um, like to ask you some questions actually..."
Garble,"[hushed] We haven't got all day, Spike!"
Spike,"Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me!"
Garble,What the...
Fume,The eggs have hatched.
Others,"""Clump"": What do we do now?"
Garble,"We take the hatchlings, of course!"
Garble,Get 'em!
Garble,Ohh... Get them!
Garble,[chuckles] Nnnghh...
Teenage dragons,Ugh!
Garble,"Nnngh, they got away! I hate that!"
Teenage dragons,Oof!
Spike,"Huh, what have we got here? What happened?"
Garble,They got away! Hey! You stole an egg?
Spike,Uh...
Garble,"Well, I guess the raid wasn't a total waste after all."
Garble,"Nice going, Spike."
Others,"""Clump"": Well, what are you waiting for, Spike? Smash it!"
Spike,Smash the egg?
Others,"""Clump"": Yeah!"
Fume,"Yeah, throw it on the ground as hard as you can!"
Teenage dragons,Yeah! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!
Spike,"No! It's just a defenseless egg, like I was! And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!"
Garble,What did you say?
Spike,I said no.
Rainbow Dash,Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!
Twilight Sparkle,That's right!
Rarity,"Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!"
Garble,"Ooh, scary, hehe! Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies your friends?"
Spike,"Yes, they are. And they're better friends than you could ever be. Now, if you don't back off, you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons."
Garble,"Oh, yeah? [snorts] What's that?"
Spike,Run away!
Twilight Sparkle,Nyuh!
Spike,"Phew, that was a close one. Thanks, you guys."
Twilight Sparkle,Of course. What are friends for?
Spike,You're more than friends. You're my family.
Spike,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Spike,"Seeing the great dragon migration made me wonder what it meant to be a dragon. But now I realize that who I am is not the same as what I am. I may have been born a dragon, but Equestria and my pony friends have taught me how to be kind, loyal, and true! I'm proud to call Ponyville my home, and to have my pony friends as my family."
Others,"Yours truly,"
Others,Spike
Spike,"Aww. [chuckles] Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee! Stick with me. I've got plenty to teach you about being a pony."
Rainbow Dash,Calling all Pegasus ponies! Meeting tonight!
Flitter,"[reading] ""Mandatory meeting for all Ponyville Pegasi."""
Rainbow Dash,"Library, tonight. Be cool or be mule. No offense."
Mule,None taken.
Rainbow Dash,"All right, go on in, find a seat. Ohh... You too, Fluttershy. Come on, let's go."
Film announcer,"Every living thing depends on the life-giving nourishment of rainwater, and it is up to Cloudsdale to provide rain-filled clouds to every corner of Equestria. But how, one pony might ask, does Cloudsdale gather all this extra water? Tornado power! That's right, Pegasi-driven tornado power. A team of Pegasi combine their wing power to create a jumbo tornado, powerful enough to pull water out of the local reservoir and funnel it all the way up to Cloudsdale. Remember, Pegasi, your jumbo tornado must reach a minimum of eight hundred wing power to lift that water up to Cloudsdale. So, the next time you're wondering ""Where does all that extra rainwater come from?"", just remem<U+0096>"
Spike,Uh... intermission?
Rainbow Dash,"So, here's the scoop. Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria. And you know what that means. It means it's up to Ponyville's Pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale."
Rainbow Dash,"Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed. Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power. But I think we can do better. I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!"
Rainbow Dash,"...if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up."
Rainbow Dash,"That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane. Nopony's getting sick on my watch. So, are we gonna train hard?"
Pegasi,Yeah!
Rainbow Dash,Are we gonna be strong?
Pegasi,Yeah!
Rainbow Dash,Are we gonna be fast?
Pegasi,Yeah!
Rainbow Dash,Record-smashing fast?
Bulk Biceps,YEAH!
Rainbow Dash,Who's with me?
Rainbow Dash,Fluttershy!
Rainbow Dash,"Stretch those glutes, Flitter! Nice flexibility, Cloud Chaser. A... little too much flexibility, Blossomforth. Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof. Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane! Good pace, Silverspeed! [blows whistle] Keep it up! We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!"
Rainbow Dash,"Good work, everypony! [under her breath] Everypony except Fluttershy."
Rainbow Dash,"[knocking] Fluttershy? I know you're in there! You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why! Fluttershy, open<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,"Fluttershy, what happened to you?"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, you poor thing. You know, there's only one cure for pony pox."
Fluttershy,"I know, plenty of bed<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,Cold water! Those pony pox are clearing right up.
Fluttershy,"Oh, y'know, all of a sudden, I'm, I'm starting to feel better. [laughs nervously] I'll just get out of these robes and<U+0096> ow! Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt. I guess I can't fly after all<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,"Messed up wing, huh? Stop horsing around, Fluttershy. We've got a lot of training to do. Come on now, what's going on?"
Fluttershy,"Well, y'see, uh, well... Oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it! I can't fly!"
Rainbow Dash,What are you talking about? Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!
Fluttershy,"But that was different, that was an emergency! This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others. Don't you remember flight camp? I couldn't gallop hard or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!"
Rainbow Dash,It wasn't that bad.
Fluttershy,"You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad. It was horrible!"
Fluttershy,"[voiceover] The other foals used to tease me, a lot!"
Fluttershy,I just can't risk that sort of humiliation again.
Rainbow Dash,"Suck it up, Fluttershy! This is no time for<U+0096> I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every Pegasus to break the record, including you. I need every ounce of wing power I can get."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash..."
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Thanks anyway.
Fluttershy,Wait. I'll do it.
Rainbow Dash,You will?
Fluttershy,I will.
Rainbow Dash,You're game?
Fluttershy,I'm game.
Rainbow Dash,Alright!
Cloud Chaser,What exactly does this machine do?
Twilight Sparkle,"This is an anemometer. It measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative H2O anti-gravitational potential. Any other questions?"
Flitter,Yeah. [to Spike] What exactly does this machine do?
Spike,It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are.
Pegasi,Ohhhh... Okay... I see...
Twilight Sparkle,"Is that you again, Thunderlane? Please, we need to have a germ-free environment."
Thunderlane,"It wasn't me, it was Blossomforth."
Rainbow Dash,"Don't worry, Twilight. Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed. Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane?"
Twilight Sparkle,We have 9.3 wing power.
Pegasi,Wow! That's fast!
Bulk Biceps,YEAH!
Twilight Sparkle,16.5 wing power!
Rainbow Dash,"Now listen up! If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record. We'll be number one!"
Foals,"[echoing] Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly..."
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] Tell her!
Rainbow Dash,"[hushed] No, you tell her!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] No, you!"
Rainbow Dash,"Um... great job, Fluttershy! You measured, uh, uh, .5."
Spike,.5? Isn't that like... less than one?
Spike,Ow!
Rainbow Dash,"Fluttershy, wait! So some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal. You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?"
Fluttershy,[crying] Yes!
Rainbow Dash,But I need you!
Fluttershy,"I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just [between sobs] don't have the courage right now..."
Fluttershy,"[sniffles] Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem."
Fluttershy,"I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me..."
Fluttershy,I know it's important to have confidence in myself...
Fluttershy,"Yes, yes, I do remember. The river was swelling..."
Fluttershy,...and you were scared...
Fluttershy,"...yes, I did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself. You're right, my friends. I shouldn't give up. I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer! A great flyer!"
Twilight Sparkle,"That's wonderful, Flitter. Much better than yesterday."
Rainbow Dash,This is crazy awesome! We're gonna smash that record!
Spike,What did he say?
Twilight Sparkle,Do I look like I speak squirrel?
Spike,What's that?
Fluttershy,2.3? 2.3?! That has to be some kind of mistake! I worked so hard!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!"
Rainbow Dash,"You did awesome, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,"No, I didn't. I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me! There's no way I'll fly with 10.0 wing power tomorrow!"
Rainbow Dash,So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power. Every bit counts!
Fluttershy,How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.0 wing power and you were flying with 2.5?
Spike,"Actually, it was only 2.3, and<U+0096> ow!"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, uh... I'd feel... um..."
Fluttershy,"Exactly! Humiliated! [between sobs] I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!"
Spike,"It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado. You'll be able to lift tons of water up to Cloudsdale!"
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps.
Rainbow Dash,Are we ready to do this?
Spike,Look!
Rainbow Dash,"Lazy Thunderlane! Where is he?! He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all. Rumble, where's your lazy brother?"
Rumble,He's got the feather flu. He's down at Ponyville Hospital.
Spike,But he's not the only one.
Twilight Sparkle,"Let's see, with those eight sick Pegasi out with the feather flu... [gasp] Oh no!"
Rainbow Dash,Don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record?
Twilight Sparkle,No...
Rainbow Dash,Phew!
Twilight Sparkle,...You might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to Cloudsdale!
Spike,"Well, should we pack up?"
Rainbow Dash,"No. Of course not. Forget the record. Cloudsdale still needs water! Okay, everypony! Let's give it all we've got! On the sound of the horn, we take off!"
Spike,You think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power?
Twilight Sparkle,I sure hope so! One hundred and fifty wing power. Two hundred and fifty wing power. Five hundred wing power!
Twilight Sparkle,Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
Fluttershy,Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!
Fluttershy,I figured... if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado... the least I could do was offer moral support!
Twilight Sparkle,"She could sure use it, considering eight Pegasi are sick with the feather flu!"
Fluttershy,Oh no! That's terrible news!
Rainbow Dash,Yaa<U+0096> oof!
Twilight Sparkle,Are you okay?
Rainbow Dash,[muffled] I'm fine!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum! I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,Rbbbb<U+0096> We've got to try again!
Twilight Sparkle,But you've pushed your crew to their limit already!
Twilight Sparkle,"If you break apart again, somepony could get hurt! You should quit, it's not safe!"
Rainbow Dash,"No! One more time! I've gotta know we gave it our all! If I'm going down, I'm going down flying! C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!"
Bulk Biceps,YEAH!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, here we go... One hundred wing power! Two hundred! Five hundred!"
Rainbow Dash,Stay in position! Flap those wings! Faster!
Twilight Sparkle,Seven hundred! Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
Spike,[yelps] They fell apart right after this!
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm too nervous to look!"
Rainbow Dash,C'mon! Just a little harder! I can see the water trying to funnel through!
Twilight Sparkle,"Seven ninety five! We are so close! Fluttershy, they need you up there!"
Fluttershy,I won't make a difference!
Twilight Sparkle,You can make a difference!
Fluttershy,My measly 2.3 wing power is still too little!
Spike,It's sticking at seven ninety five! I don't know if they've got any more in 'em!
Twilight Sparkle,Do it for Equestria! Do it for Rainbow Dash! Do it for yourself!
Twilight Sparkle,It's moving! She's doing it! Seven ninety eight! She surpassed her best wing power number!
Fluttershy,No!
Others,"""Serenity"": What was that?"
Others,"""Slipstream"": I think it was Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle,She did it! She did it! They all did it!
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, girl, take it easy!"
Fluttershy,"Whuh, what? Did we do it?"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, we did it! You did it!"
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,Ah!
Flitter,"Great job, Fluttershy, that was awesome!"
Cloud Chaser,"Yeah, we couldn't have done it without you."
Spitfire,"Nice job, Rainbow Dash. You may not have set a new record, but you showed a lot of guts."
Rainbow Dash,"Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy! Let's hear it for Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Fluttershy,"Sometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, I learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small. If you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself, anything can happen."
Sweetie Belle,Can you believe Featherweight got his cutie mark? Featherweight! Before us!
Snips,"Great cutie mark, Featherweight!"
Snails,[chuckles] Looking good!
Sweetie Belle,I give up...
Apple Bloom,I've got it! The answer to all our problems!
Sweetie Belle,The Foal Free Press? How's the school paper gonna get us our cutie marks?
Granny Smith,Move your caboose!
Apple Bloom,Uh-oh. That's Granny Smith. Gotta run!
Scootaloo,Maybe there's something to this newspaper idea.
Sweetie Belle,Guess it's worth a shot...
Sweetie Belle,Apple Bloom. Your newspaper idea was nothing but a big bust.
Scootaloo,"We tried everything, from papier-m<e2>ch<e9> to making birds' nests, and nothing worked."
Sweetie Belle,What's so funny?
Apple Bloom,"What I meant was, we should write for the paper! We can get our cutie marks as journalists!"
Cheerilee,"Okay, class, see you tomorrow! Oh, for those of you who want to join the newspaper staff, stay here, because we're meeting right now!"
Apple Bloom,Cutie marks in journalism!
Scootaloo,Such a good idea.
Cheerilee,"Welcome, everypony. Now, as you know, our editor-in-chief graduated last year<U+0096>"
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, oh, oh, ohohohoh!"
Cheerilee,Yes?
Sweetie Belle,What's an editor-in-chief?
Cheerilee,"Good question, Sweetie Belle. I like those reporter's instincts. The Foal Free Press is a student-run paper. I'm only involved as an adviser, so the editor-in-chief is the pony in charge, from choosing the stories to making sure it gets to press on time. Now, as I said, we have a new editor this year!"
Students,Diamond Tiara?!
Diamond Tiara,Hm.
Cheerilee,I'll leave you alone now to discuss everypony's assignments. Have fun!
Diamond Tiara,"Alright, listen up. The Foal Free Press is a joke."
Students,Huh?
Diamond Tiara,"Nopony at this school takes it seriously. Well I, the editor-in-chief in charge, am going to deliver us to newfound glory!"
Truffle,Yay!
Diamond Tiara,First things first. Where's the staff photographer? Get out there and document everything. I'll decide what's important.
Diamond Tiara,"The rest of you, I want hard-hitting news and interesting think pieces. No more Namby-Pamby stories like last year's editor."
Others,"""Ruby Pinch"": But Namby-Pamby was a great editor."
Diamond Tiara,"Well, there's a new regime now, and I want juicy stories. The juicier, the better! Now get out there and report!"
Scootaloo,"Let's get out of here, girls. Maybe we can try packing boxes again."
Sweetie Belle,"But this could be our last chance to earn our cutie marks! If we really are supposed to be journalists, isn't it worth a little grief?"
Scootaloo,I guess you're right. We can take a little bit of Diamond Tiara for a lifetime of cutie marks.
Sweetie Belle,C'mon! Let's go get these marks!
Sweetie Belle,[voiceover] My first story's going to be an exclusive interview.
Scootaloo,[voiceover] I saw a brand new nest of baby birds the other day. I bet our readers would eat up a sweet story like that!
Apple Bloom,[voiceover] Granny Smith has all sorts of great stories! I reckon I'll do a piece on the history of Ponyville.
Diamond Tiara,"I hope you've got something, because everything so far is unusable. ""Baby Birds Born""? ""Rarity's Hot New Hat""? ""Ponyville: The Early Years""!? Oh! I don't know what you call this, but it sure isn't news!"
Sweetie Belle,We just... thought...
Diamond Tiara,"Get something else on my desk by the end of the day, and it better be juicy!"
Scootaloo,Now what? Do you know what I had to do to get that story?
Apple Bloom,"Oh, you don't even wanna know what I had to sit through."
Snips,"Oh! Get it off me, Snails!"
Snails,"Eh, you get it off me, Snips?"
Snips,"Aah! Stop it! You are making it worse! Nah! Oh, great."
Snips,Aah!
Snails,Get it off! Get it off!
Sweetie Belle,"[giggles] Hey, Featherweight, c'mere! [giggles] Take a few pictures of this, then meet me during lunch. Girls, I have our story."
Others,"""Noi"": ""Snips and Snails in Bubblegum Veils! And that's when the biggest jokester in school really stuck his hoof in it <U+0096> literally!"""
Others,"""Green Daze"": The Foal Free Press is usually just boring news and stuff."
Cotton Cloudy,So funny!
Snips,Our mothers always told us we'd end up in the papers someday.
Diamond Tiara,"Your column is a sensation! I don't want you doing news anymore. I want more columns like this. Columns about ponies and their private lives, the things they do when they think they're alone. You three are my new gossip columnists! And I love the way you signed it! ""Gabby Gums""... [sigh] That was a stroke of genius!"
Sweetie Belle,"We couldn't fit all of our names, so we decided to create one for all three of us."
Diamond Tiara,"Well, I want more Gabby Gums! Nice work, girls."
Scootaloo,But we sure seem to have a gift for gossip.
Sweetie Belle,"If we can write a few more of these Gabby Gums columns, we'll earn our cutie marks for sure!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Woo-hoo!
Sweetie Belle,Scootaloo? Do you have anything?
Scootaloo,Nope.
Sweetie Belle,Apple Bloom?
Apple Bloom,[sighs] Sorry.
Scootaloo,"Let's face it, nothing very juicy happens at this school."
Sweetie Belle,We're doomed.
Rarity,"Ohh, Sweetie Belle... Was she raised in a barn or something? [gasps] Oh, you really shouldn't be snooping, Rarity... Oh, but it's so much fun, Rarity. Hello... what's this? [giggles] Gum on their bum! [laughs] Too rich!"
Sweetie Belle,Can you please keep it down with all the laughter? I'm trying to<U+0096> hey!
Rarity,"Bleh! I, I was just<U+0096>"
Sweetie Belle,Are you snooping through my saddlebag?
Sweetie Belle,How dare you!
Rarity,"Oh, but this Gabby Gums column is so funny!"
Sweetie Belle,You actually like the school paper?
Rarity,It's so much juicier than anything in the boring old Ponyville Express. Could I borrow this to show my friends?
Sweetie Belle,Your friends would wanna read the Foal Free Press?
Rarity,"Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums! Who is she, anyway? I've never heard of her before. Is she a new<U+0096>"
Sweetie Belle,"We gave up too quickly, girls. Forget trying to squeeze stories out of this school. We need to expand!"
Apple Bloom,We can find all kinds of great gossip out there in Ponyville!
Sweetie Belle,We'll need to tell Featherweight to start working overtime.
Scootaloo,"Sweetie Belle, you're a genius!"
Diamond Tiara,"""Pound and Pumpkin Cake Trip to the Store Ends in Tears."" Gabby Gums comes through again!"
Truffle,[panting] The Ponyville news stand wants to carry the Foal Free Press! Ponies keep coming by and asking for it!
Diamond Tiara,"Send 'em twenty copies, and if they run out of those, we'll send 'em twenty more! You three are doing a great job for this paper. Keep those columns coming!"
Scootaloo,This is great!
Rarity,"Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls? The best hooficure I've ever had!"
Applejack,"[voice vibrating] You said it, ooh..."
Spike,[sighs] I don't know if I've ever been so relaxed.
Rainbow Dash,You guys!
Spike,Aaah!
Rainbow Dash,"The new Gabby Gums just came out! ""The Great and Powerful Trixie's Secrets Revealed!"""
Rarity,"We already read that one, Rainbow Dash. Come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing."
Rainbow Dash,"[swallows] Did you forget who you're talking to? The day I get a hooficure is the day I turn in my daredevil license. Besides, I haven't read this Gabby Gums yet."
Spike,"Well, do it quietly, will ya? [sigh] Some of us are trying to unwind!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I like Gabby Gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean?"
Applejack,"She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!"
Twilight Sparkle,"""Celestia Just Like Us""? Gabby Gums doesn't value anypony's privacy."
Rarity,"Oh, lighten up, Twilight, it's nothing but harmless gossip!"
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one. ""Mayor Not Naturally Gray!"" The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal? Who wouldn't wanna read that?"
Twilight Sparkle,I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. It's gotta be a little embarrassing.
Rainbow Dash,Are you kidding? Do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper?
Rarity,"Rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures?"
Rainbow Dash,"It's that good, huh? Well, maybe just one little hoof."
Rainbow Dash,"[yelps] Forget it, I don't like ponies touching my hooves. Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums did a story on me."
Spike,She did one on me.
Main cast,What?!
Spike,Aaaah!
Apple Bloom,"""Exclusive! Local Dragon Tells All! Spike opens up about Canterlot, naps, and his favorite jams!"""
Scootaloo,It's our best column yet!
Diamond Tiara,More like your worst column yet! Gabby Gums didn't become the biggest thing in Ponyville with namby-pamby stories like this!
Apple Bloom,"[sighs] Yeah, she's right. This column is a little softer than our usual gossip."
Sweetie Belle,Were you guys feeling guilty about all the gossip too? Like... maybe we could be hurting other ponies' feelings?
Apple Bloom,"Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because everypony loves Gabby Gums so much, but... I was sorta hoping we could start writing more stories like this one."
Scootaloo,Me too.
Sweetie Belle,"If we're gonna get our cutie marks, we've got to give the ponies what they want."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Awww...
Applejack,"""Applejack Asleep on the Job!"" Can y'all believe this?! And this one: ""Big McIntosh <U+0096> What's He Hiding?"" Who the hay does this Gabby Gums think she is?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Listen to this one. ""Twilight Sparkle: I Was a Canterlot Snob. A well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes."" Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle,How could you say such a thing?
Spike,"Well, I didn't! Gabby Gums made that up! I never said anything like that!"
Rarity,"Everypony, please! She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip. You're really making too big a deal out of this."
Twilight Sparkle,"But it's all lies! Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants! She doesn't care whose reputation she destroys! ""Fluttershy Has Tail Extensions!"" ""Pinkie Pie is an Out-of-Control Party Animal!"""
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, look! According to this one, the Cakes are breaking up!"
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. We are?!
Rainbow Dash,"[muffled] Well, my life is officially over. [normal] Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale."
Twilight Sparkle,"""Rainbow Dash: Speed Demon or Super Softie?""?!"
Rainbow Dash,"I grabbed as many copies as I could, but it was too late! [crying] I'm a laughing stock!"
Twilight Sparkle,"See, Rarity? Your so-called 'harmless gossip' can be very hurtful!"
Rarity,"Honestly, you ponies have no sense of humor. So she tweaks a few ponies every now and then, maybe they deser<U+0096> [gasps] I'll destroy her! ""The Drama-Queen Diaries""... She's reprinted my diary! How could Gabby Gums possibly get access to my private diary?!"
Twilight Sparkle,We've got to put a stop to this once and for all! Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff. Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is.
Rarity,"[gasps] My sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums! I resent you even suggesting such a thing, Twilight! Why, she's the most innocent, most lovely<U+0096>"
Rarity,<U+0096>most evil pony in Equestria! How could my own sister steal my private diary? How could my own sister be... Gabby Gums?
Rarity,"Et tu, Gabby Gums?!"
Sweetie Belle,[gasps] You know?! How'd you find out?!
Rarity,The gilded pages of your betrayal!
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, yeah."
Rarity,"How could you do this to me?! You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read! Gossip can be a very hurtful thing. It is an invasion of privacy, just like when I snooped through your saddlebag. You didn't like that much, did you?"
Sweetie Belle,No...
Rarity,What is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel!
Sweetie Belle,"I do understand, and we've all been feeling guilty, but we just want our cutie marks so badly!"
Rarity,Do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny?
Sweetie Belle,"Well, when you put it that way..."
Diamond Tiara,No! I won't let you quit!
Sweetie Belle,But the gossip we've been printing is hurting everypony's feelings!
Diamond Tiara,"Feelings?! I don't care about feelings! Gabby Gums is my bread and butter, and I'm not gonna let you goody-two-horseshoes take that away from me!"
Sweetie Belle,"We're sorry, Diamond Tiara, but we've made our decision."
Scootaloo,"Yeah, you can't force us to keep gossiping."
Diamond Tiara,When you see these... you may not want to quit after all.
Diamond Tiara,I told Featherweight to document everything...
Diamond Tiara,...And that's exactly what he did.
Scootaloo,[gasps] Gimme those!
Diamond Tiara,"Sorry, girls, property of the Foal Free Press. And if Gabby Gums really does go into retirement, I'll need something to fill that empty column space. Now get out there and bring me more Gabby Gums!"
Sweetie Belle,"We'll find a way out of this, girls."
Scootaloo,Maybe Rainbow Dash will have a story for us. She's always good for some gossip.
Apple Bloom,"Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums!"
Sweetie Belle,"You heard too, huh?"
Rainbow Dash,Are you kidding? Everypony in town knows it's you three.
Scootaloo,"Don't suppose you'd let us write a column on you, huh?"
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, hi, Angel. Is Fluttershy home?"
Scootaloo,"[muffled] Hey, what gives?"
Spike,"A-ha! [muffled] Twilight thought you might try to show your faces around here, so she put up a force field."
Apple Bloom,"Aw, c'mon, Applejack! You're not mad at us too, are you?"
Applejack,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,You're not even gonna talk to us?
Applejack,Nnope.
Big McIntosh,"You should be ashamed of yourself, humiliatin' your sister 'n' me like that. We don't wanna talk to any o' y'all right now so take your little gossip column and your embarrassing photographs and just go away!"
Sweetie Belle,We've ruined all of our friendships and we still don't have our cutie marks!
Apple Bloom,This is the worst day ever!
Scootaloo,"Oh yeah? Wait 'til tomorrow, our most embarrassing moments are about to be published for everypony to laugh at."
Apple Bloom,So what do we do?
Sweetie Belle,"I don't know, but we're not leaving this clubhouse until we think of something!"
Diamond Tiara,"That's it, Gabby Gums is out of time. Run these instead. I want this paper on every street corner in Ponyville!"
Others,"""Shady Daze"": Yes, ma'am!"
Sweetie Belle,Stop the presses!
Others,"""Shady Daze"": Uh... they haven't started yet."
Scootaloo,We have a Gabby Gums column!
Diamond Tiara,"Hmph, you're lucky I'm nice."
Diamond Tiara,"This better not happen again, or else."
Diamond Tiara,"[sighs] Well done, Diamond Tiara. You've averted yet another crisis with your amazing diplomatic skills. [gasps] ""An Open Letter to Ponyville by Gabby Gums""?! What is this?! Ooh, they're not gonna get away with this! I'll publish those photos tomorrow! They messed with the wrong pony!"
Sweetie Belle,"To the citizens of Ponyville,"
Others,"For some time now, you've been reading this column to get the latest dirt and the hottest buzz. But this will be my final piece. We want to apologize for the pain and embarrassment we've caused."
Apple Bloom,"Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo."
Scootaloo,"As the popularity of our column grew, we got swept up in the hype. We knew that what we were doing didn't feel quite right, but we ignored the guilt because everypony seemed to want to read what we were writing."
Sweetie Belle,"From now on, we promise to respect everypony else's privacy, and we won't engage in hurtful gossip any more."
Apple Bloom,"All we can do is ask for your forgiveness, Ponyville."
Others,"Signing off for the very last time,"
Others,"XOXO, Gabby Gums"
Cheerilee,And for the next editor of the Foal Free Press...
Cheerilee,"...here's your new editor-in-chief, Featherweight!"
Diamond Tiara,Ugh! Him? But what about me?!
Others,"""Shady Daze"": Here ya go! I've been promoted to staff photographer!"
Pinkie Pie,"Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. You've really outdone yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. This is sure to be the winning entry of this year's national dessert competition!"
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, thank you, Pinkie!"
Mr. Cake,Mr. And thanks for transporting it all the way to Canterlot for us.
Pinkie Pie,Absolutely! It's my honor and I<U+0096>
Applejack,"Uh, beg pardon, but could we maybe move things along? This here cake's a mite heavy. Right, Big McIntosh?"
Big McIntosh,[grunts] Eeyup...!
Pinkie Pie,"Alrighty then, Big Mac! To the train depot! That's it, Big Mac, nice and slow. This is precious cargo you're carrying."
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Yes, it took months of planning and testing."
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. I would hate for it to<U+0096>
Mr. Cake and Mrs. Cake,Mr. Cake and Mrs. Fall!
Pinkie Pie,"Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, a little pegassistance? I'll get it there safely, you'll see!"
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Ahahah, oh... of course, Pinkie."
Mr. Cake,Mr. We never doubted you.
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, can I see you a second? A nice protective spell as extra insurance. [laughs] Better safe than sorry. AJ, Rarity, one last thing? All right, everypony, we're in the home stretch here."
Pinkie Pie,"See, Mr. and Mrs. Cake? I got it here without a hitch! Now all we have to do is get it... in?"
Pinkie Pie,[sigh] Thank you all for helping me get the cake safely on the dessert car.
Twilight Sparkle,Thank you for inviting us all to go with you to Canterlot for the National Dessert Competition.
Rarity,I'm sure the festivities will be just lovely.
Applejack,Phooey on the festivities! I can't wait to try all those tasty treats!
Pinkie Pie,"Well, the tastiest treat of all is sure to be the Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. All that rich creamy goodness of the marzipan, combined with the tart tanginess of the mascarpone, blended perfectly with the smooth, silky sweetness of the meringue. That's why I call the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness the ""MMMM""."
Rest of main cast,MMMM.
Pinkie Pie,"Exactly. It's the most delicious delectable delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria, and it's sure to win first prize."
Gustave le Grand,"Zis is not so, for I, Gustave le Grand, do challenge your crude cake to a duel of delectable delicacies against my exceptionally Exquisite <c9>clairs! They will undoubtedly strike down all ze competition, winning first prize and crowning me le champion."
Donut Joe,"Not a chance, le Grand."
Twilight Sparkle,Donut Joe! What are you doing in Ponyville?
Pinkie Pie,Hello. What's your name?
Mulia Mild,"I am Mulia Mild. Behold, my Chocolate Mousse Moose. It will trample all your treats, be given first prize, and make me the greatest chef in Equestria."
Gustave le Grand,"Madame Mild, you and your mousse moose are mistaken."
Donut Joe,Your frou-frou <e9>clairs will never defeat my donuts!
Pinkie Pie,The Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness is going to win!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, it sure looks like we're in for a delicious competition tomorrow. Maybe we should all settle in for a good night's sleep."
Donut Joe,Hmph.
Mulia Mild,Nyahh.
Rainbow Dash,[yawns] I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.
Applejack,"Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself."
Pinkie Pie,"Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs? We have to protect ""MMMM""."
Rarity,MMMM?
Pinkie Pie,"Mmm-hmmm. I know for super sure that ""MMMM"" is the best dessert in all of Equestria, and I know that they know it too."
Rainbow Dash,So...
Pinkie Pie,So... one of them is going to sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight! You have to help me stand guard!
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie... you're overreacting.
Applejack,"Yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm."
Pinkie Pie,But they are! I just know it.
Rainbow Dash,"Fine! If you want to stand guard, go for it. We're going to bed."
Pinkie Pie,I'll show them. I'll stay up all night and protect you. Nothing and nopony will stop me from keeping you safe.
Pinkie Pie,"Huh? Stop, you saboteur! I have you now! Wha? A-ha! Ahh?! Oh! Thank Celestia you're okay! But one of those bakers is mixing up something bad, so I'm not leaving you again no matter what."
Pinkie Pie,"Huh? Who turned out the moon? Don't go near that cake, thief!"
Pinkie Pie,"Stop, thief!"
Pinkie Pie,"[snores] Huh? What? [gasp] The cake! Oh, MMMM, you look mmmm-marvelous."
Twilight Sparkle,Whoa!
Pinkie Pie,I know. I think some congratulations are in order for a job well done.
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, you better hold off on giving yourself an award just yet, Pinkie. Look."
Applejack,What is it?
Rainbow Dash,What happened?
Pinkie Pie,"It's the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, it's been [crying] mutilated!"
Pinkie Pie,Now we just need to find out who done it.
Twilight Sparkle,"You mean, who did it."
Pinkie Pie,Exactly. Who did-done-dood it.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, having read many mystery novels, I know that the only way to discover the culprit is to investigate."
Pinkie Pie,Exactly.
Pinkie Pie,"And as chief detective, that's exactly what I'm gonna do."
Applejack,"Uh, you're investigatin'?"
Pinkie Pie,Yes! And Twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers.
Twilight Sparkle,"Fine, Pinkie. Should we start looking for clues?"
Pinkie Pie,"Perfect silly question, my dear Twilight. Because the obvious answer is..."
Twilight Sparkle,Yes?
Pinkie Pie,No! 'Cause I know who did it.
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, how could you possibly know?"
Pinkie Pie,"How could I possibly not know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker, who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your <e9>clairs lacked flair, Gustave!"
Pinkie Pie,"Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition."
Twilight Sparkle,But it makes no sense!
Pinkie Pie,"What do you mean, lowly assistant?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here?"
Pinkie Pie,Huh... Guess that isn't a totally silly question.
Twilight Sparkle,"And second, the cake hasn't been sliced. It's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hm... You're right, my fine fellow. Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the ""MMMM"" was destroyed by another baker. A baker who's donuts are do-nots. That's right, it was Joe!"
Pinkie Pie,"[voiceover] Or as he's known the spy world, Mane. Con Mane."
Pinkie Pie,Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie! There is no laser beam security system! And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy!"
Donut Joe,Hey!
Rarity,"Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo."
Pinkie Pie,"Huh... You may be right, lowly assistant."
Twilight Sparkle,May be?
Pinkie Pie,"Now that I'm taking a closer look at these desserts, I see that one simply cannot look me in the eye."
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie... that moose is a mousse!
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the ""MMMM""."
Twilight Sparkle,So you're saying that the culprit is...
Pinkie Pie,Mulia Mild!
Pinkie Pie,"Putting an end to the Cakes' dreams of taking first prize. Huh, I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia."
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her!"
Pinkie Pie,[sigh] I guess you're right...
Twilight Sparkle,Thank you!
Pinkie Pie,"But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the ""MMMM"". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's <e9>clairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose. [sighs] why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?"
Pinkie Pie,[gasp] Now I have no idea who do-doned it!
Pinkie Pie,This mystery gets more mysterious every minute.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay, Pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. Now you were here at the scene of the crime all night."
Pinkie Pie,"Huh! You're not accusing me, are you?"
Twilight Sparkle,No! But maybe you saw something that will help us.
Pinkie Pie,I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!
Twilight Sparkle,Good... Let's retrace your steps.
Pinkie Pie,"And then I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there, he was gone."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,Already?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next."
Pinkie Pie,"I heard somepony else in the dessert car and chased them up to the engine. But when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal."
Twilight Sparkle,"The conductor, huh? [gasp] But that doesn't make any sense. What happened next, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie,Well... I went back to the dessert car.
Twilight Sparkle,Yes?
Pinkie Pie,"The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own."
Twilight Sparkle,Interesting. Anything else?
Pinkie Pie,"I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud..."
Pinkie Pie,"...and then they were gone! When I opened the curtains, I saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh my, what is that?"
Twilight Sparkle,What next Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie,That's it. I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night.
Twilight Sparkle,"And when you woke up, half the cake was gone?"
Pinkie Pie,Exactly.
Twilight Sparkle,"By Jove, I think I've got it. Call everypony back. We have a cake culprit to catch."
Mulia Mild,[stuttering] Why are we all here again?
Twilight Sparkle,I bet you're wondering why you're all here again.
Donut Joe,She's good.
Twilight Sparkle,We have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage.
Gustave le Grand,But how?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like... this."
Pinkie Pie,"A-ha! A blue feather! I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers."
Pinkie Pie,"No, 'cause he's been dyeing them!"
Twilight Sparkle,"No, Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they flew away. But the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,I-I don't even like cake!
Pinkie Pie,So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!
Twilight Sparkle,"Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... this."
Pinkie Pie,So it was you! That pink hair came from your rainbow-colored mane!
Rainbow Dash,"I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie,So you're wearing a wig?
Rainbow Dash,Ow! Cut it out!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was... Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy,[gasp] Oh my.
Pinkie Pie,"You're goin' down, Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?"
Rarity,"[gasp] What? Is it a crime to change one's style now and again? Why, I think it's a crime not to."
Twilight Sparkle,Really?
Rarity,"Fine, I'm guilty! [crying] I wear false eyelashes! Oh, and I took a bite of the cake."
Fluttershy,So did I.
Rainbow Dash,"Aw nuts, so did I."
Rarity,You just made it sound so delectable.
Fluttershy,So tasty.
Rainbow Dash,And boy was it!
Rarity,"I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite."
Fluttershy,And it was so good.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I just dove right in!"
Fluttershy,But I'm really really sorry.
Rarity,Terribly sorry.
Rainbow Dash,"Sorry, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,That's okay. At least this mystery is finally solved.
Twilight Sparkle,"But it isn't. We figured out who ate the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods."
Pinkie Pie,"You're right, Twilight. You know what we have to do?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well... Yes, I do. Do you?"
Pinkie Pie,"Look for clues! [sniffing] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, Pinkie. Did you find the devourer of the desserts?"
Pinkie Pie,I most certainly did. It was none other than... the bakers!
Pinkie Pie,"First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache! And Joe has <e9>clair in his hair! And Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!"
Twilight Sparkle,"What do you say, bakers?"
Gustave le Grand,"Oh, I am so sorry, Mulia, but Pinkie made your mousse moose sound... tr<e8>s magnifique."
Donut Joe,And Pinkie's description of your <e9>clairs really did make 'em sound scrumptious.
Mulia Mild,"And the way she spoke of your Donutopia, ohh, was too delectable to resist."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, everypony, we finally have the mystery solved."
Gustave le Grand,"Yes, but now we don't have any desserts to enter into ze contest!"
Pinkie Pie,I think we can fix that. Come on!
Pinkie Pie,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Pinkie Pie,"Today I learned that it is not good to jump to conclusions. You have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. If you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did. This could hurt their feelings, and it can make you look really foolish. So from now on, I will always make sure to get all the facts."
Pinkie Pie,"How's that for a lesson, Princess Celestia?"
Twilight Sparkle,Care for a bite?
Pinkie Pie,I don't mind if I do.
Pinkie Pie,Mmmmm.
Rarity,Ahh!
Rarity,It is gorgeous out. Just gorgeous!
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Twilight, I am sure you are as excited as I am about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot. [to the others] Wedding? [reading] I will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion. Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music."
Fluttershy,Oh my goodness! What an honor!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception."
Pinkie Pie,"Hip, hip, hooray!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception."
Applejack,"Well, color me pleased as punch!"
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,"...I would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their ""I do""'s."
Rainbow Dash,Yes!
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids."
Rarity,"Princess Celestia wants me to<U+0096> [unintelligible] ...wedding dress? For a Canterlot wedding... I, ah, ooh, oooh!"
Twilight Sparkle,"And as for you, Twilight, you will be playing the most important role of all: Making sure that everything goes as planned. See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia. But... I don't understand. Who's getting married?"
Spike,"Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first."
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and... [gasp] My brother?!
Applejack,"Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight! That's great news!"
Fluttershy,"Um, Twilight? Are you okay?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor and I have always been so close. He's my B.B.B.F.F!"
Twilight Sparkle,Big Brother Best Friend Forever?
Rest of main cast,Ohhh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Before I came here and learned the importance of friendship, Shining Armor was the only pony I ever really accepted as a friend. When I was just a filly, I found it rather silly To see how many other ponies I could meet I had my books to read, didn't know that I would ever need Other ponies to make my life complete"
Others,But there was one colt that I cared for I knew he would be there for me
Others,"My big brother, best friend forever! Like two peas in a pod, we did everything together"
Others,"He taught me how to fly a kite (Best friend forever!) We never had a single fight (We did everything together!) We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams I miss him more than I realized It seems..."
Others,"[Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity] Your big brother, best friend forever Like two peas in a pod, you did everything together"
Twilight Sparkle,"And though he's, oh, so far away I hoped that he would stay My big brother best friend Forever... Forever..."
Applejack,As one of your P.F.F.'s...
Applejack,Pony Friends Forever...
Rest of main cast,Ohhh!
Applejack,...I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy.
Twilight Sparkle,"He is pretty special. I mean, they don't let just anypony be captain of the Royal Guard."
Rarity,"[chirp] So let me get this straight. We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a captain of the Royal Guard?"
Twilight Sparkle,I guess we are.
Rarity,"Ooh, ooh, oooh!"
Rainbow Dash,"A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?! Can you say ""best wedding ever""?!"
Pinkie Pie,[gasp] [echoing] Best wedding ever!
Spike,"So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but I'm the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party?"
Applejack,"Why the long face, sugarcube?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm just thinking about Shining Armor. Ever since I moved to Ponyville, we've been seeing each other less and less. And now that he's starting a new family with this ""Princess Mi Amore Ca-whatshername"", we'll probably never see each other."
Applejack,"Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you."
Twilight Sparkle,Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married.
Pinkie Pie,"We're here, we're here!"
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, what's with all the guards?"
Rarity,I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.
Rarity,"Now, let's get going! We've got work to do!"
Applejack,And you've got a big brother to go congratulate.
Twilight Sparkle,Yeah. Congratulate. And then give him a piece of my mind.
Twilight Sparkle,"I've got something to say to you, mister."
Shining Armor,"Twily! Ah, I've missed, you, kid. How was the train ride? I<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,"How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister, for pony's sake!"
Shining Armor,It's not my fault! Princess Celestia has requested a major increase in security. Didn't you see all the guards at the train station?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it?"
Shining Armor,"It has nothing to do with the wedding. A threat has been made against Canterlot. We don't know who's responsible for it, but Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection. This, you need to see."
Shining Armor,[gasps] The burden of keeping Canterlot safe and secure rests squarely on my shoulders. Staying focused on the task at hand has been my top priority.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any more?"
Shining Armor,Hey. You're my little sister. Of course you're important to me. But I'd understand if you didn't want to be my best mare now.
Twilight Sparkle,You want me to be your best mare?
Shining Armor,Well... yeah.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'd be honored! But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even meet this ""Princess Mi Amore Cadenza""?"
Shining Armor,"Twily, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance, your old foalsitter."
Twilight Sparkle,Cadance? As in the Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?!
Shining Armor,[chuckles] You tell me. She was your foalsitter.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind..."
Young Twilight Sparkle,I am so lucky to have you as my foalsitter!
Young Cadance,"I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight."
Young Twilight Sparkle,[scoffs] You're a princess. I'm just a regular old unicorn.
Young Cadance,You are anything but a regular old unicorn.
Wild Fire,I am going for a hooficure and that is that!
Lucky Clover,You are not going<U+0096>
Wild Fire,I am! I am!
Lucky Clover,I've already paid for three this month!
Wild Fire,I... no! My girlfriends are all getting their hooves done! And you said that onl<U+0096>
Lucky Clover,"Please, we've done this at least<U+0096>"
Lucky Clover,"Oh! Ho, ho, ho."
Wild Fire,"Oh, sweetie. You just did that face."
Twilight Sparkle,How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And you're marrying her! [sing-song voice] You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance!
Princess Cadance,I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
Twilight Sparkle,"Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!"
Princess Cadance,What are you doing?
Twilight Sparkle,"Cadance, it's me, Twilight!"
Princess Cadance,[uninterested] Uh-huh.
Shining Armor,"I've gotta get back to my station, but Cadance will be checking in with all of you to see how things are going. I think I speak for both of us when I say we couldn't be more excited to have you here. Right, dear?"
Princess Cadance,Absolutely.
Shining Armor,"Well, we'll let you get to it."
Applejack,"Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bite-size apple fritter you ever tasted..."
Twilight Sparkle,Mmm. Check.
Applejack,"Hiya, Princess!"
Princess Cadance,"Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."
Applejack,"Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?"
Princess Cadance,I have!
Applejack,"Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go? [squee] I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly."
Twilight Sparkle,Did... you see what she...
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed! [imitating Cadance] ""Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."""
Princess Cadance,Did I hear someone say my name?
Princess Cadance,[unenthusiastically] Uh-huh. Is my dress ready?
Rarity,"[stammers] Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm!"
Princess Cadance,I was hoping for something with more beading and a longer train.
Rarity,"Oh, yes, of course."
Princess Cadance,And those should be a different color.
Twinkleshine,I think they're lovely.
Minuette,Me too!
Lyra Heartstrings,I love them.
Princess Cadance,Make them a different color.
Twilight Sparkle,"Gee, maybe her name should be ""Princess Demandy-pants."""
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, let me see. We've been over the games... [rattles dice] ...the dances..."
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you?
Princess Cadance,Perfect! ...If we were celebrating a six-year-old's birthday party.
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Thank you!
Princess Luna,"Rest, my sister. As always, I will guard the night."
Twilight Sparkle,Bet I can guess what you're all thinking. Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever.
Spike,"[high voice] Who, me?"
Applejack,Spike! That goes on the cake.
Rarity,"Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, she was so demanding!"
Rarity,"Well, of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres, she threw them in the trash?"
Applejack,"Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, she was just being fake and totally insincere!"
Fluttershy,She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
Twilight Sparkle,See? Rude!
Fluttershy,But he was singing really off-key.
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treated<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Never mind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?"
Rainbow Dash,"Sorry, Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude."
Rarity,The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.
Twilight Sparkle,"And I'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor, let alone marry him!"
Applejack,Think maybe you're bein' just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
Rest of main cast,Uh-huh.
Twilight Sparkle,"I am not being possessive, and I am not taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even [thumps table] be a wedding!"
Shining Armor,"Twily! Your big brother's looking pretty good, don't you think? Huh. Everything okay?"
Twilight Sparkle,We need to talk. I think you're making a big<U+0096>
Shining Armor,"Oh, uh, hi, sweetie."
Twilight Sparkle,She sure has a way of sneaking up on people.
Princess Cadance,"Could I speak to you for a moment, dear?"
Shining Armor,Better see what she wants.
Princess Cadance,"[muffled] Look, we need to talk."
Shining Armor,[muffled] I'm here to talk.
Princess Cadance,"[muffled] It's about your sister, okay?"
Shining Armor,"[muffled] I<U+0096> look, look, she's okay<U+0096>"
Princess Cadance,"[muffled] Just... listen to me, (over Shining Armor) alright? No no<U+0096>"
Shining Armor,"[muffled] I'm listening, I'm listening."
Princess Cadance,[muffled] I thought I made it perfectly clear I didn't want you to wear that.
Shining Armor,This was my favorite uncle's.
Princess Cadance,And?
Shining Armor,And I think I should wear it.
Princess Cadance,Are you disagreeing with me?
Shining Armor,I guess I am<U+0096> Ah!
Princess Cadance,"Oh, dear. Are you getting another one of your headaches?"
Shining Armor,Gyah!
Princess Cadance,Feeling better?
Shining Armor,[grunts] Mm-hmm.
Twilight Sparkle,She isn't just unpleasant and rude. She's downright evil!
Shining Armor,Twilight!
Princess Cadance,Let her go.
Shining Armor,Huh. It seemed like she had something else she wanted to tell me.
Princess Luna,"Who goes there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle."
Twilight Sparkle,Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to help<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,Dresses? What are you<U+0096>?
Fluttershy,Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!
Twilight Sparkle,New bridesmaids? What happened to her old bridesmaids?
Applejack,She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love-love-love it if we'd fill in for them.
Rarity,Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
Applejack,And you had your doubts about her.
Rarity,Told you she was an absolute gem!
Rainbow Dash,You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.
Rarity,Hmm. I'll see what I can do.
Twilight Sparkle,Looks like I really am on my own.
Princess Celestia,"Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter."
Princess Celestia,"I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare."
Spike,[deep voice] Do you? [high voice] I do!
Shining Armor,Hey... has anypony seen Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,I'm here! I'm not gonna stand next to her! And neither should you!
Shining Armor,"I'm sorry, I... I don't know why she's acting like this."
Princess Cadance,Maybe we should just ignore her.
Twilight Sparkle,You have to listen to me!
Fluttershy,"Oh, goodness! Are you okay?"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm fine.
Applejack,Ya sure about that?
Twilight Sparkle,I've got something to say! She's evil!
Twilight Sparkle,"She's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!"
Princess Cadance,[starts crying] Why are you doing this to me?!
Twilight Sparkle,Because you're evil!
Twilight Sparkle,"Evil! And if I don't stop you, you're gonna ruin my brother's life!"
Shining Armor,"You want to know why my eyes went all [bells jangling]? Nuh! Because ever since I started having to perform my protection spell, I've been getting terrible migraines. Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me!"
Shining Armor,"And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be in the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your [stomps hoof] friends, it's because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding!"
Twilight Sparkle,I was just trying to<U+0096>
Shining Armor,"She's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that our big day be perfect! Something that obviously wasn't important to you! [gasps] Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and comfort my bride. And you can forget about being my best mare. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all."
Applejack,"C'mon, y'all. Let's go check on the princess."
Twilight Sparkle,I was<U+0096>
Princess Celestia,You have a lot to think about.
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe I was being overprotective. I could've gained a sister. But instead... I just lost a brother.
Others,"He was my big brother, best friend Forever... And now, we'll never do anything Together..."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm sorry!
Princess Cadance,You will be.
Twilight Sparkle,"""Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and..."" [gasp] My brother?"
Shining Armor,"Twily! Ah, I've missed you, kid."
Twilight Sparkle,How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married!
Shining Armor,A threat has been made against Canterlot. Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection.
Twilight Sparkle,But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know.
Shining Armor,Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance.
Twilight Sparkle,Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!
Princess Cadance,I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
Twilight Sparkle,"Cadance, it's me! Twilight!"
Princess Cadance,[uninterested] Uh-huh.
Shining Armor,And I think I should wear it.
Princess Cadance,Are you disagreeing with me?
Twilight Sparkle,She's evil! I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!
Shining Armor,"Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me! If I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all."
Twilight Sparkle,I just lost a brother. I'm sorry!
Princess Cadance,You will be.
Twilight Sparkle,[echoing] Hello? Is anyone there?
Twilight Sparkle,Where am I?
Princess Cadance,"The caves beneath Canterlot, once home to greedy unicorns who wanted to claim the gems that could be found inside. And now, your prison."
Twilight Sparkle,Help! Help!
Twilight Sparkle,Plans? What plans?
Princess Cadance,"The plans I have for your brother, of course."
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't you dare do anything to my brother, you... you monster!"
Princess Cadance,"No! Wait! Ugh! Please! Don't hurt me! Twilight, it's me! Please, you have to believe me. I've been imprisoned like you. The Cadance who brought you down here was an imposter."
Twilight Sparkle,Likely story!
Princess Cadance,"Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake. Clap your hooves..."
Twilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance,...and do a little shake.
Twilight Sparkle,You remember me!
Princess Cadance,Of course I do. How could I forget the filly I love to sit for the most?
Twilight Sparkle,We have to get out of here. We have to stop her!
Queen Chrysalis,This day is going to be perfect The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small Everypony will gather 'round Say I look lovely in my gown What they don't know is that I have fooled them all!
Princess Cadance,"This day was going to be perfect The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small But instead of having cake With all my friends to celebrate My wedding bells, they may not ring for me at all<U+0085>"
Queen Chrysalis,"I could care less about the dress I won't partake in any cake Vows, well I'll be lying when I say"
Others,That through any kind of weather I'll want us to be together The truth is I don't care for him at all
Others,No I do not love the groom In my heart there is no room But I still want him to be all mine
Princess Cadance,"We must escape before it's too late Find a way to save the day Hope, I'll be lying if I say"
Others,"""I don't fear that I may lose him To one who wants to use him Not care for, love, and cherish him each day"""
Others,"For I oh so love the groom All my thoughts he does consume Oh, Shining Armor, I'll be there very soon"
Queen Chrysalis,Finally the moment has arrived For me to be one lucky bride
Princess Cadance,"Oh, the wedding we won't make He'll end up marrying a fake Shining Armor will be..."
Princess Celestia,"Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to witness the union of [muffled] Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor."
Princess Cadance,"Oh, we're never going to save him."
Twilight Sparkle,We will. We just have to find... There!
Others,"Minuette, Lyra Heartstrings, You're not going anywhere."
Princess Celestia,"Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,Stop!
Queen Chrysalis,Ugh! Why does she have to be so possessive of her brother? [sobbing] Why does she have to ruin my special day?
Princess Cadance,Because it's not your special day! It's mine!
Queen Chrysalis,What? But how did you escape my bridesmaids?
Others,"Minuette, Lyra Heartstrings, I want it!"
Queen Chrysalis,Hmph. Clever. But you're still too late.
Applejack,I-I don't understand. How can there be two of 'em?
Princess Cadance,She's a changeling. She takes the form of somepony you love and gains power by feeding off your love for them.
Queen Chrysalis,"[laughing] Right you are, Princess. And as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food for my subjects. Equestria has more love than any place I've ever encountered. My fellow changelings will be able to devour so much of it that we will gain more power than we have ever dreamed of!"
Princess Cadance,They'll never get the chance! Shining Armor's protection spell will keep them from ever even reaching us!
Queen Chrysalis,"[chuckling] Oh, I doubt that. Isn't that right, dear?"
Shining Armor,Mm-hmm.
Queen Chrysalis,"Ah, ah, ah. Don't want to go back to the caves, now do you? Ever since I took your place, I've been feeding off Shining Armor's love for you. Every moment he grows weaker and so does his spell. Even now, my minions are chipping away at it."
Queen Chrysalis,"[laughing] He may not be my husband, but he is under my total control now."
Queen Chrysalis,"And I'm sorry to say, unable to perform his duties as captain of the Royal Guard."
Princess Cadance,Not my Shining Armor!
Queen Chrysalis,"Soon, my changeling army will break through. First, we take Canterlot. And then, all of Equestria!"
Princess Celestia,"No. You won't. You may have made it impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from you!"
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Celestia!
Queen Chrysalis,Ah! Shining Armor's love for you is even stronger than I thought! Consuming it has made me even more powerful than Celestia!
Princess Celestia,The Elements of Harmony. You must get to them and use their power to defeat the queen.
Others,"Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity!"
Queen Chrysalis,"[laughing] You can run, but you can't hide!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Go, go!"
Rainbow Dash,Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. How did you...?
Twilight Sparkle,"They're changelings, remember?"
Others,"Changelings [as Twilight Sparkle]: They're changelings, remember?"
Twilight Sparkle,Don't let them distract you. We have to get to the Elements of Harmony. They're our only hope.
Applejack,"OK, this is just gettin' weird. Real me! Real me!"
Pinkie Pie,"[laughing] Do me! Do me! Meh, I've seen better."
Princess Cadance,You won't get away with this! Twilight and her friends will<U+0096>
Queen Chrysalis,"You were saying? You do realize the reception's been cancelled, don't you? Go! Feed!"
Applejack,"Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you."
Twilight Sparkle,It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.
Queen Chrysalis,"Hmm, I did, didn't I?"
Twilight Sparkle,Quick! Go to him while you still have the chance!
Shining Armor,Wha<U+0096> where... huh? Is...is the wedding over?
Queen Chrysalis,It's all over!
Twilight Sparkle,Your spell! Perform your spell!
Queen Chrysalis,[laughing] What good would that do? My changelings already roam free.
Shining Armor,No! My power is useless now. I don't have the strength to repel them.
Princess Cadance,My love will give you strength.
Queen Chrysalis,[chuckling] What a lovely but absolutely ridiculous sentiment.
Queen Chrysalis,Noooooo!
Princess Celestia,Don't worry about me. I'm fine. You have a real wedding to put together.
Twilight Sparkle,"Seriously, though. I get why the queen of the changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone as amazing as Cadance to marry you?"
Shining Armor,"I told her she wouldn't just be gaining a husband. She'd be getting a pretty great sister, too."
Princess Celestia,"Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the real Princess Mi Amore Cadenza<U+0096>"
Princess Cadance,Princess Cadance is fine.
Princess Celestia,"Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce you mare and colt!"
Princess Celestia,"This is your victory as much as theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us. Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn."
Princess Celestia,"Rainbow Dash, that's your cue."
Rainbow Dash,Best... wedding... ever!
Princess Luna,"Hello, everypony. Did I miss anything?"
Pinkie Pie,[squee] Let's get this party started!
Twilight Sparkle,"Love is in bloom A beautiful bride, a handsome groom, Two hearts becoming one A bond that cannot be undone because"
Others,"Love is in bloom A beautiful bride, a handsome groom I said love is in bloom You're starting a life and making room For us (For us, For us....)"
Shining Armor,"Twilight! None of this would've been possible without you, little sis. Love ya, Twily."
Twilight Sparkle,"Love you too, B.B.B.F.F."
Shining Armor,Ready to go?
Princess Cadance,Oh! Almost forgot.
Rarity,IT'S MINE! Oof! Ahaha... ha.
Twilight Sparkle,"[background] Love is in bloom A beautiful bride, a handsome groom I said love is in bloom You're starting a life and making room For us, (For us... For us... Aah...)"
Twilight Sparkle,Now this was a great wedding.
Others,Royal guard # News from Northern Equestria! Uh... Your Highness.
Princess Celestia,Yes?
Others,Royal guard # I am simply to tell you that it has returned.
Princess Celestia,[gasp] Find Princess Cadance and Shining Armor.
Others,"Royal guard # Yes, Your Highness."
Princess Celestia,"My dearest Twilight, you must come to Canterlot at once."
Twilight Sparkle,"[panicked breathing] Where are all my quills? Brbrbr. No, no, no, no, no... Ugh! I need the Magical Compendium volumes 1 through 36! Where is it?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Flash cards! I should make some flash cards. Spike, I'm gonna need you to quiz me. On everything. Everything I've ever learned. Ever. That isn't going to be enough cards."
Spike,"Twilight, calm down. It's just a test."
Twilight Sparkle,"Just a test? Just a test!? Princess Celestia wants to give me some kind of exam, and you're trying to tell me to calm down because it's just a test?!"
Spike,Uh... yes.
Applejack,"I'd say she's handling things pretty well, considerin'."
Twilight Sparkle,Urgh!
Princess Luna,Are you sure you don't want me to go as well?
Princess Celestia,Yes. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor are already there. The others will be joining them soon.
Princess Luna,"The Empire's magic is powerful. It cannot fall again, my sister."
Princess Celestia,"She will succeed at her task. And when she does, we'll know that she is that much closer to being ready."
Twilight Sparkle,Ahem.
Princess Celestia,"Trust me, little sister."
Twilight Sparkle,"You wanted to see me? To give me a test? I brought my own quills and plenty of paper to show my work. Sorry, sorry!"
Princess Celestia,This is a different kind of test. The Crystal Empire has returned.
Twilight Sparkle,"The Crystal Empire? I'm sorry, I-I thought I'd studied. Ooh. I don't think there's anything in any of my books th<U+0096>"
Princess Celestia,"There wouldn't be. Few remember it ever existed at all. Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic. One thousand years ago, King Sombra, a unicorn whose heart was black as night, took over the Crystal Empire."
Princess Celestia,"He was ultimately overthrown, turned to shadow, and banished to the ice of the arctic north."
Princess Celestia,"But not before he was able to put a curse upon the Empire. A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air. If the Empire is filled with hope and love, those things are reflected across all of Equestria. If hatred and fear take hold... Which is why I need your help finding a way to protect it."
Twilight Sparkle,You want me to help protect an entire empire?
Princess Celestia,"It is, as I said, a different kind of test. But one I'm certain you will pass."
Twilight Sparkle,How do I begin?
Princess Celestia,By joining Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire.
Twilight Sparkle,My brother is there?
Princess Celestia,"He is. And your Ponyville friends will join you there as well. I have every confidence you will succeed. And when you do, I'll know you are ready to move on to the next level of your studies."
Twilight Sparkle,But what if I fail?
Princess Celestia,You won't.
Twilight Sparkle,But what if<U+0096>
Princess Celestia,"You won't. But Twilight, in the end, it must be you and you alone who ultimately assists Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in doing what needs to be done to protect the Empire. Do you understand?"
Twilight Sparkle,Mm-hmm!
Princess Celestia,Then go. There is no time to lose.
Spike,"Ah! Twilight! That was fast! Let me guess, you got a perfect score? A-minus? B-plus? [gasp] Twilight, did you... [quietly] fail?"
Twilight Sparkle,I was prepared to do my best Thought I could handle any test For I can do so many tricks But I wasn't prepared for this
Others,Levitation would have been a breeze Facts and figures I recite with ease
Twilight Sparkle,The square root of five hundred and forty-six is twenty-three point three six six six four two eight nine one zero nine.
Professor Bill Neigh,She is correct!
Twilight Sparkle,"I could ace a quiz on friendship's bliss But I wasn't prepared for this Will I fail, or will I pass? I can't be sure..."
Spike,She can't be sure...
Twilight Sparkle,"My mind is sharp, my skills intact My heart is pure..."
Spike,Her heart is pure...
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I've taken my share of licks I've made it through the thin and thick But no I wasn't"
Spike,"Oh no, she wasn't"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh no, I wasn't"
Spike,"Oh no, she wasn't"
Twilight Sparkle,No I wasn't
Twilight Sparkle and Spike,Prepared... for this!
Spike,"Uh, prepared for what exactly?"
Applejack,"Twilight! Uh, did you pass?"
Pinkie Pie,Are we gonna celebrate your awesomeness with Princess Celestia?
Twilight Sparkle,Not quite. We're going to the Crystal Empire!
All,Huh?
Rainbow Dash,Crystal what?
Rarity,Ha! And you all made fun of me for packing so many scarves.
Shining Armor,Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,Shining Armor?
Shining Armor,Twily! You made it! We'd better get moving. There are things out here we really don't want to run into after dark.
Fluttershy,[gulp] What kind of things?
Shining Armor,Let's just say the Empire... isn't the only thing that's returned.
Shining Armor,Something keeps trying to get in! We think it's the unicorn king who originally cursed the place.
Twilight Sparkle,"But Princess Celestia said I was being sent here to find a way to protect the Empire! If King Sombra can't get in, then it must already be protected."
Fluttershy,"[gasp] Th-That's one of the things, isn't it?"
Shining Armor,Guh. We have to get to the Crystal Empire! Now!
Twilight Sparkle,"Go, go!"
Shining Armor,Almost there.
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps for breath] Everypony okay?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, no! Shining Armor, your horn!"
Pinkie Pie,Sparkleriffic!
Rarity,It's gorgeous! Absolutely gorgeous! [mumbles incoherently] There are no words!
Applejack,"Focus, Rarity. We're here to help Twilight, not admire the scenery."
Rainbow Dash,"Eh, I don't see what the big deal is. Just looks like another old castle to me."
Rarity,A<U+0096> p<U+0096> guh! Another old...! Have you lost your mind? Look at the magni<U+0096>
Rarity,Very funny.
Twilight Sparkle,Cadance!
Princess Cadance,Ooh.
Twilight Sparkle,Are you okay?
Shining Armor,"Cadance has been able to use her magic to spread love and light. That seems to be what is protecting it. But she hasn't slept, barely eats. I want to help her, but my protection spell has been countered by King Sombra."
Princess Cadance,"[breathes deeply] It's alright Shining Armor, I'm fine."
Shining Armor,"She's not fine. She can't go on like this forever, and if her magic were to fade... Well, you saw what's out there waiting for that to happen."
Twilight Sparkle,That's why we're here.
Applejack,Why we're all here.
Other ponies,Mm-hmm.
Shining Armor,"Well, with Cadance putting all her strength into keeping her spell going, and me trying to keep an eye on signs of trouble in the arctic, we haven't been able to gather much information from the Crystal Ponies."
Rarity,"Crystal Ponies?! Hahaha, there are Crystal Ponies?! Um, ahem. Please continue."
Shining Armor,But we have to believe one of them knows how we can protect the Empire without having to use Cadance's magic.
Twilight Sparkle,A research paper!
Shining Armor,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,That must be part of my test <U+0096> to gather information from the Crystal Ponies and deliver it to you! This is gonna be great! I love research papers!
Rainbow Dash,"[sarcastically] Yeah, who doesn't?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh-oh-oh! Lemme guess! Is it Spike? Nono, Fluttershy! Rarity?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, big brother. I am really good at this sort of thing."
Twilight Sparkle,Are you sure? Absolutely sure?
Twilight Sparkle,King Sombra's spell must be why their coats aren't... crystally.
Autumn Gem,Have we really been gone a thousand years?
Twilight Sparkle,Yes.
Autumn Gem,It feels like it was just yesterday.
Twilight Sparkle,"If you think of anything, even the smallest thing..."
Autumn Gem,Of course.
Spike,"Well, that was a total bust."
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe the others are having better luck.
Rainbow Dash,A way to protect the Empire! You know anything about it or what?
Fleur De Verre,I wish I could help you. Really.
Rainbow Dash,Hold on! You gotta know something!
Fleur De Verre,But... I don't have any information.
Pinkie Pie,Time to gather some intel!
Elbow Grease,It just feels like something is missing.
Others,"""Night Knight"": I know. It looks the same, but it doesn't feel the same."
Pinkie Pie,Because it isn't!
Elbow Grease,[gasps] A spy!
Pinkie Pie,[screams] A spy? How did they know? Ah! Must have noticed my night vision goggles. Ooh! Night vision-y!
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I got nothing so far.
Rarity,"Oh, me neither."
Pinkie Pie,"[hushed] My cover has been blown. I repeat, my cover has been blown!"
Twilight Sparkle,Ooookay.
Applejack,"Sorry, Twilight. These crystal ponies seem to have some kinda collective amnesia or somethin'. Only thing I was able to get out of 'em was somethin' about a library."
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] A library? Well, why didn't you say so?!"
Applejack,Uh... thought I just did.
Twilight Sparkle,I just... I don't even know what to... There are no words.
Amethyst Maresbury,Ahem. May I help you?
Twilight Sparkle,Yes. We're looking for a book.
Amethyst Maresbury,We have plenty of those.
Twilight Sparkle,[in awe] You do. You really do.
Applejack,We're lookin' for a history book. Somethin' that might tell us how the Empire might've protected itself from danger back in the day.
Amethyst Maresbury,"Yes. Of course. History, history... Ah, yes."
Twilight Sparkle,"Which is where, exactly?"
Amethyst Maresbury,I... I can't seem to remember. I'm not sure I actually work here.
Rainbow Dash,Ugh.
Twilight Sparkle,We'll just take a look around. I'm sure we can find it on our own.
Amethyst Maresbury,Let me know if you find anything.
Pinkie Pie,I like her!
Applejack,"Uh, anyone else startin' to think this is a lost cause?"
Twilight Sparkle,"No, no, no, no, no... Yes! ""History of the Crystal Empire"". I just hope it has the answers we need."
Twilight Sparkle,"A 'Crystal Faire'. According to this book, it was established by their first queen and became their most important tradition. The Faire was held every year to ""renew the spirit of love and unity in the empire so they could protect it from harm"". My friends and I could put it together. Everything we need to know is in the book!"
Shining Armor,That sounds pretty promising.
Twilight Sparkle,"We'll get started right away. C'mon, Spike, we've got a Crystal Faire to put together!"
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Cadance needs our help Her magic will not last forever I think we can do it But we need to work together
Others,"We have to get this right Yes, we have to make them see We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history"
Rainbow Dash,It says that they liked jousting
Rarity,They flew a flag of many hues
Applejack,Made sweets of crystal berries
Fluttershy,They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes
All,"Oh, we have to get this right Yes, we have to make them see We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history"
Pinkie Pie,There was a crystal flugelhorn That every pony liked to play
Twilight Sparkle,And the Crystal Kingdom anthem Can you learn it in a day?
All,"Oh, we have to get this right Yes, we have to make them see We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history"
Twilight Sparkle,"It looks amazing! I don't know how I could've done this without you! One last check to make sure everything is in place, and then the festivities can begin!"
Applejack,What's this thing for?
Twilight Sparkle,"The last page of the book mentioned a Crystal Heart as the faire's centerpiece, so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block."
Applejack,"Nice work, Twi. Think we're ready to get this faire up and runnin'."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hear ye, hear<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,[blows flugelhorn] Flugelhorn! [laughs nervously] My bad.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ahem. Hear ye, hear ye! Princess Cadance and Prince Shining Armor do cordially invite you to attend the Crystal Faire!"
Applejack,"Come on in, y'all. Got food and drinks thataway, games and crafts are thataway, Crystal Heart to the back near the Princess."
Elbow Grease,Did she say... Crystal Heart?
Rainbow Dash,"We totally nailed it, right? Must be feeling a lot of love and unity about now! Gonna have some grub, huh? What are you thinking? Crystal Empire berry pie? Maybe some crystal corn-on-the-cob! [pause] What is with these ponies?!"
Autumn Gem,"Seeing all of this, I feel like I'm starting to remember. Remember things from before the king."
Fleur De Verre,Me too.
Others,Autumn Gem<U+00A0> [gasps] The Crystal Heart!
Fleur De Verre,Do you think they really have it?
Rainbow Dash,"Of course we have it! Can't have a Crystal Faire without the Crystal Heart, right?"
Amethyst Maresbury,"Of course you can't. The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so the light within them can power the Crystal Heart, so that the Empire can be protected! [gasps] I do work at the library!"
Rainbow Dash,W-what's that about 'powering the heart'?
Amethyst Maresbury,"I just can't believe you found it. King Sombra said he'd hidden it away where we would never see it again! I only hope it will still be as powerful after all these years...! Mm, funnel cake!"
Twilight Sparkle,Why did you<U+0096>
Rainbow Dash,I think we may have a problem...
Twilight Sparkle,I didn't know it was an actual relic! The book didn't mention anything about the Crystal Ponies powering the Heart! There was a page missing... How did I not notice?!
Princess Cadance,"It's alright, Twilight."
Shining Armor,Twily...
Twilight Sparkle,You wanted to see me? To give me a test?
Princess Celestia,The Crystal Empire has returned.
Twilight Sparkle,You want me to help protect an entire empire?
Princess Celestia,It must be you and you alone.
Twilight Sparkle,But what if I fail?
Shining Armor,Let's just say the Empire... isn't the only thing that's returned.
Twilight Sparkle,"Go, go!"
Pinkie Pie,Sparkleriffic!
Shining Armor,"Well, with Cadance putting all her strength into keeping her spell going, and me trying to keep an eye on signs of trouble in the arctic, we haven't been able to gather much information from the Crystal Ponies."
Rarity,There are Crystal Ponies?!
Twilight Sparkle,"""History of the Crystal Empire"". The last page of the book mentioned a Crystal Heart as the Faire's centerpiece, so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block."
Amethyst Maresbury,"The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so the light within them can power the Crystal Heart, so that the empire can be protected!"
Rainbow Dash,I think we may have a problem...
Twilight Sparkle,I didn't know it was an actual relic!
Princess Cadance,"It's alright, Twilight."
Shining Armor,Twily...
Shining Armor,The Empire is under attack.
King Sombra,Arrgh!
Shining Armor,I have to find the Crystal Heart!
Twilight Sparkle,"No, you stay here with Cadance. She needs you, Shining Armor. I'll retrieve the Heart."
Rainbow Dash,Let's do this!
Twilight Sparkle,I've been trying to figure out how I'm meant to pass Celestia's test. Retrieving the Crystal Heart must be it. But there is something else you can do.
Rainbow Dash,Name it.
Twilight Sparkle,You and the rest of our friends have to keep the Faire going.
Rainbow Dash,What? With that thing moving into the Empire?
Twilight Sparkle,"The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so they can activate the Crystal Heart."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, and?"
Twilight Sparkle,"If the Crystal Ponies find out that King Sombra is trying to take over the Empire again, their spirits are gonna be anything but lifted. It won't matter if I find the Crystal Heart. They won't be able to make it work. You have to keep them happy here at the Faire."
Rainbow Dash,Keep the Faire going and the Crystal Ponies' spirits high. Done and done!
Shining Armor,"Twily, be careful."
Twilight Sparkle,I will.
Spike,[under his breath] Uh-huh. We can do that. Twilight's doing what?!
Rarity,He... really... loves getting his face painted. Haha.
Rainbow Dash,Who wants a flugelhorn?
Pinkie Pie,I want a flugelhorn!
Rainbow Dash,<U+00A0>Who else wants a flugelhorn?
Pinkie Pie,[screaming]<U+00A0>I want a flugelhorn!!
Spike,"[pants] Twilight, wait! I'm coming with you!"
Twilight Sparkle,You can't. I have to retrieve the Crystal Heart by myself.
Spike,I know. I promise I won't lift a claw to help you.
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Not a claw, Spike."
Spike,Where are we going exactly?
Twilight Sparkle,I think I might know where King Sombra hid the Crystal Heart.
Spike,The castle?
Twilight Sparkle,The king would've been counting on the fact that nopony would dare come looking for it here. They'd have been too afraid to even try.
Spike,I hope you're right.
Twilight Sparkle,You and me both.
Rainbow Dash,What are you lookin' at?! That's what I thought!
Applejack,"[whispering] Uh, Rainbow Dash? We're supposed to be actin' like nothing's wrong."
Applejack,"[hushed] What I mean is, maybe you should let me keep the Crystal Ponies away from the fake Heart, while you show off your joustin' skills."
Rainbow Dash,Huh. Seeing my awesomeness does have a way of putting ponies into a pretty good mood.
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Knight Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,Huh?
Rainbow Dash,It's showtime.
Applejack,How are y'all feelin'? Havin' a good time?
Autumn Gem,The best I've had in over a thousand years!
Applejack,"Well, that's good! Gotta renew that spirit of love and unity if you're gonna power up that Crystal Heart, right?"
Autumn Gem,I sure would like to see it before the ceremony. It's been such a long time.
Applejack,"Oh, I hear ya, but, uh... phew! Gettin' a little toasty out here. Bet you'd like to cool off with a little Crystal Empire nectar! [panicked noise] Uh, you tried the Crystal Empire fritters yet? Made from a traditional Crystal Empire recipe! You're gonna love 'em! [loudly] Uh, I hear there's a joustin' match about to start! You don't wanna miss that! [hushed] Come on, Twilight... These Crystal Ponies are more curious than a cat!"
Twilight Sparkle,"It's gotta be here somewhere. It's just gotta be! Not a claw, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle,Celestia's orders!
Twilight Sparkle,Of course!
Spike,[panting for breath] Argh! What? Did you find it?
Twilight Sparkle,No. Because this isn't King Sombra's castle.
Spike,"Well, isn't this where he lived when he was in power?"
Spike,Whoa. When did you learn to do that?
Twilight Sparkle,That was a little trick Celestia taught me.
Twilight Sparkle,You stay here.
Spike,"Huh, if you insist. [echoing] Can you see what's down there yet?"
Twilight Sparkle,[echoing] Not yet. I can't even tell how far down this goes!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike?
Spike,[echoing] Yeah?
Twilight Sparkle,[echoing] Can you see outside?
King Sombra,[growls] Yesss... Crystalsss...
Spike,It's not good! Cadance's magic must be fading [echoing] faster than before!
Spike,[echoing] Twilight? Are you okay?
Twilight Sparkle,Yes...
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, I think it's here! Huh?"
Princess Celestia,What are you doing here?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know! I opened the door and<U+0096>
Princess Celestia,And now you must go.
Twilight Sparkle,Go where?
Princess Celestia,"Doesn't matter to me. You failed the test, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't understand! The test?
Princess Celestia,"Not only will you not move on to the next level of your studies, you won't continue your studies at all!"
Twilight Sparkle,I... You didn't say anything about no longer being your student if I failed!
Princess Celestia,Didn't I?
Twilight Sparkle,But... what do I do now?
Spike,"[incredibly distant and muffled] Twilight! [closer] Twilight? Twilight! Twiliiiight! [quickly] I know you told me to stay up there, but you were down here for such a long time and you weren't answering and I got worried so I came down here and you were just staring at that wall and... I was calling your name, but I couldn't seem to get your attention, and<U+0096> What were you looking at? I mean... it's just a wall. ...Ponyville?! Well, how did I get... No! I don't wanna go! Please, Twilight, don't make me!"
Twilight Sparkle,King Sombra's dark magic. A doorway that leads to your worst fear.
Spike,We were home. You told me you didn't need me anymore. You were sending me away...
Twilight Sparkle,A fear that will never come to pass. I'm never gonna send you away. And I'm not gonna fail my test!
Spike,What's in there?
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Stairs. Lots and lots of stairs. [sighs] Maybe you should come with me this time.
Crystal Pony,"[off-screen] Bravo, Knight Rainbow Dash!"
Fluttershy,[nervous exhale] [catching breath] Isn't there... somepony else who could... take over the jousting demonstration with you?
Rainbow Dash,"[scoffs] The fate of an entire empire rests on us showing these ponies a good time. But, y'know, if that isn't important to you..."
Rainbow Dash,"[sigh] Okay, okay, I'll take it easy on you next time. But not too easy. I've got a reputation to maintain!"
Spike,[panting] What if this is just more of his magic? He makes a door that leads to your worst nightmare. Why not a staircase that goes on forever?
Twilight Sparkle,Hold on to me.
Spike,Uh...
Twilight Sparkle,[sounds of exertion] Whoa. Whoaaa! Yaaaah!
Rarity,"[laughs nervously] Excuse me, pardon me... [hushed] I am running out of weaving materials for the traditional crafts booth! I just made a hat out of three pieces of hay and a drinking straw! I made it work. But still!"
Applejack,"We gotta do everything we can to keep this thing goin'. The Princess isn't lookin' so good. I can't imagine her magic is gonna last much longer. It's gonna be fine. These ponies are gonna power up that Crystal Heart when the time comes, and we won't be needin' her magic anyway."
Crystal Beau,This isn't the Crystal Heart.
Rarity,"[laughs nervously] Oh, of course it isn't. The real one is<U+0096>"
Applejack,On its way!
Rarity,[hushed] I was going to say 'being polished' to buy us some more time?
Applejack,Oops.
Sapphire Joy,It's... It's him!
King Sombra,Crystal Heart...
Twilight Sparkle,The Heart... Where's the Crystal<U+0096>
Spike,Here! It rolled over to me when you dropped it!
Twilight Sparkle,Don't move!
Twilight Sparkle,"You can move, just not toward me! How could I have been so foolish? I was just so eager to get it! Then when I saw what was going on outside, I..."
Spike,"You have to get out of there, Twilight! You have to be the one who brings the Heart to Princess Cadance! If you don't, you'll fail Celestia's test!"
Twilight Sparkle,"King Sombra is already attacking the Empire. He could reach the Crystal Ponies at any moment... reach Princess Cadance, my brother, my friends. There may not be enough time for me to find a way to escape."
Twilight Sparkle,You have to be the one to bring the Crystal Heart to the Faire.
Spike,Me? But Twilight<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,Go!
Spike,But<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,Goooo!
Applejack,"Now, don't y'all worry your pretty, little Crystal heads! The real Crystal Heart will be here any second!"
Rarity,[hushed] I don't know if they believe you...
Applejack,[hushed] Don't know if I believe me...
Sapphire Joy,He's back! I can't take it! [shrieks] Ugh!
King Sombra,Ahhhhhh...
Sapphire Joy,[shrieks] King Sombra...!
King Sombra,My crystal slaves...
Spike,Whoa! Huh! [spits fire] Yah! [nervous noise] Hey! Up here!
Rarity,Spike?
Spike,I got the Crystal Heart!
King Sombra,[growls] That is mine!
Rarity,[gasps] Spikey-wikey!
King Sombra,Hah. Huh?
Bright Smile,Behold! The Crystal Princess!
Princess Cadance,The Crystal Heart has returned. Use the light and love within you to ensure that King Sombra does not.
King Sombra,What? No... No! Stop!
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Good job, Spike."
Rarity,I do so wish it was permanent. Did you see how my mane just absolutely sparkled?
Applejack,But... good things are better when they're a rarity.
Shining Armor,Everything's gonna be okay. You've gotta stop saving my rump like this. It's starting to get embarrassing.
Twilight Sparkle,Wasn't me who saved you in the end. It was Spike.
Shining Armor,It's just a test. Maybe she'll let you retake it.
Twilight Sparkle,I don't think she's gonna give me a new test.
Spike,"[breathing heavily] [to himself] Keep it together, buddy... Gotta stay strong... for Twilight..."
Princess Celestia,It's beautiful.
Twilight Sparkle,I wish it had been me who ultimately made it so. But it wasn't.
Princess Celestia,"Twilight, as I understand it, Spike brought Princess Cadance the Crystal Heart because you weren't sure how quickly you could find a way to escape the tower. You weren't willing to risk the future of the citizens of the Crystal Empire in an effort to guarantee your own. Far better that I have a student who understands the meaning of self-sacrifice than one who only looks out for her own best interests."
Twilight Sparkle,Does this mean...?
Spike,"She's totally gonna lose it! [breathes heavily] Keep it together, buddy... Gotta stay strong... for Twilight...!"
Twilight Sparkle,I passed!
Twilight Sparkle,Ooh.
Rarity,You were prepared to do your best Had what it takes to pass the test All those doubts you can dismiss Turns out you were
All sans Twilight Sparkle,Prepared for this!
Applejack,You clearly have just what it takes
Pinkie Pie,To pass a test with such high stakes
Fluttershy,We knew for sure you would prevail
Rainbow Dash,Since when does Twilight Sparkle ever fail?
All sans Twilight Sparkle,All those doubts that you can dismiss Trust yourself and you cannot miss
Others,"[Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie] Turns out you were"
Twilight Sparkle,Turns out I was
Others,"[Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, and Spike] Turns out you were"
Twilight Sparkle,Turns out I was
Rarity,Turns out you were
All sans Twilight Sparkle,Prepared for this!
Spike,"Try again, Twi, you can do it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Phew, this spell's a toughie. But I feel lucky this time! One, two..."
Pinkie Pie,Hi!
Twilight Sparkle,"Nnnnnng! Pinkie, why'd you do that?!"
Pinkie Pie,"'Cause hugs are funneriffic, especially when you throw one around a friend. Whatcha doin'?"
Twilight Sparkle,Trying to turn that apple into an orange!
Spike,But you kinda threw her aim off...
Pinkie Pie,"Wheee! [giggles] What a cute orange birdie! Do me next, Twilight! Do me, do me!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooooh, Rarity, wanna see Twilight turn me into an orange? It's gonna be funna-fun-fuuun!"
Rarity,"As fun as creating this haute couture ensemble that I just finished making? Delightful, non?"
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] This is terrible!
Rarity,"I admit it's perhaps not my finest work, but I<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,You had total-awesome-amazing fun and I missed out on it?! Neh! Wait! What if there's more awesome amazing fun with friends happening somewhere in Ponyville right now that I'm missing out on too?!
Spike,We weren't going to turn her into an orange! I swear!
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Rainbow Dash, whatcha doing?"
Rainbow Dash,This punk cloud got so heavy it's making fog. Figure I'll thin this bad boy out so it floats back up.
Pinkie Pie,"Oooh, fun! Wheeeeee! Gotta go!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, thanks, Pinkie...?"
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Applejack! That looks like fun, can I join you? Wheee! Next time I'll pull you!"
Pinkie Pie,Fluttershy! [panting] There... you... are...! Doing... [deep breath] anything... [deep breath] fun?
Fluttershy,Not especially.
Fluttershy,"Feeling better, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie,Abso-tutely-lutely! Thanks for letting me rest in your butterfly grove while I get my Pinkie strength back!
Fluttershy,What are friends for?
Pinkie Pie,"That's just the thing! I've got so many wonderful friends having fun in every last corner of Ponyville, I can't figure out how to keep up with it all! It's driving me even more coco-loco than usual!"
Fluttershy,I can promise to not do anything fun at all if that would help.
Pinkie Pie,You are such a good friend.
Applejack,"There you are, Pinkie. Been lookin' everywhere for ya, girl."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Pinkie. Got something fun planned this afternoon thought you might wanna know about."
Applejack,"Heh. Well, I'll be an apple crisp. I'm here for the same reason."
Pinkie Pie,"This is perfect! Everyone will now bring their fun to me. Ha, this'll solve everything! Why didn't I think of that?"
Rainbow Dash,"Actually, what I meant is after I'm done whipping up today's weather, I'll be chilling by the lake catching some rays. Wanna hang?"
Pinkie Pie,I am so there. Wheee.
Applejack,And my family's havin' a barn-raisin' this afternoon at Sweet Apple Acres.
Pinkie Pie,"And I'm also so there. Whee, whee."
Rainbow Dash,"But... that's when I'll be at the swimming hole. Ah, well, doesn't matter. Whichever one you choose is okay with me."
Applejack,Me too.
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Choose?
Twilight Sparkle,"One, two..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie! What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you doing now?"
Pinkie Pie,"Timing myself galloping back and forth between the swimming hole and Sweet Apple Acres. I'm trying to cut down my time so if Rainbow Dash dives off the swing, I can get to Sweet Apple Acres to help with the barn raising, and then be back in time to see Rainbow Dash hit the water after doing a double flip! [sigh] If I can cut my time by only twenty minutes, I'm good."
Twilight Sparkle,"[laughs] Oh, Pinkie. I'm afraid no matter how hard you try, the only way to pull something like that off is if there's more of you to go around."
Pinkie Pie,"That's it, Twilight! The legend of the Mirror Pool!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Legend of the who-what now? Pinkie! I'm familiar with loads of legends, and I never heard of<U+0096>"
Spike,Does this mean practice is over?
Twilight Sparkle,Of course not! Back to work.
Pinkie Pie,"Seems like hardly anypony's been here in ages. I hope I'm remembering the rhymes right from my Nana Pinkie's story. ""Where the brambles are thickest, there you will find a pond beyond the most twisted of vines!"" [echoes] What was that?! Oh, I heard a voice! Oh. Hehe. It was me. Ouch! Ooh! Stop scratching me up, you brambles, and<U+0096> Whoooaaa!"
Pinkie Pie,"[gasp] The Mirror Pool! [echoes] Oh, and there's that voice again! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Ah Pinkie, you have got to stop talking to yourself. Starting... now. ""And into her own reflection she stared, uh, yearning for one whose reflection she shared, and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"""
Pinkie Pie 2,Wheee-heee!
Pinkie Pie,"Wow, the legend is true. It really worked!"
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, wait. I promised not talk to myself anymore. I should say something to her. Or... would that still be talking to myself? Excuse me, me? Can I have a word with you? Uh, I mean, me? Listen, I can see you're having lots of fun, but<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie 2,Fun?! Did somebody say fun? Where?
Pinkie Pie,"I did, over here!"
Pinkie Pie 2,I thought someone said something about fun! Where is it? Over here? Over here? I don't see it! Where is it? Where is it?
Pinkie Pie,"Whoa, calm yourself, Pinkie, there's loads of fun to be had in Ponyville with my girls! Trot on over back to Ponyville with me and I'll tell you all about 'em."
Pinkie Pie,"...And then there's Rarity. She's the one with all the fancy clothes and ribbons and stuff! I'm thinking she can make us all matching t-shirts that say 'Team Pinkie', and<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie 2,Is this Ponyville? Where's the fun? Where's the fun?
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, well, let's see, Applejack's having a barn raising at<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,It's that-away!
Pinkie Pie,"Wait, come back! Don't forget to meet me back here to tell me everything about everything, like I was there myself! Because I'm you and, and you're me, and<U+0096> Oh, my gosh! This is the greatest plan ever! [squee] Now, off to double my fun!"
Pinkie Pie,"Let's rock this pool, ponies! [blows up inflatable] Whee!"
Pinkie Pie,"Coming in, Dashie? The water's great, it's totally wet and everything!"
Rainbow Dash,I don't know... Cloud busting was tougher work than usual today. [yawns] I'm kind of exhausted.
Pinkie Pie,"That's fine, you relax. At least we'll still be together!"
Rainbow Dash,"Glad you made it, Pinkie. I thought you maybe went to Applejack's, instead."
Pinkie Pie,I did.
Rainbow Dash,Oh. The barn up yet?
Pinkie Pie,I have no idea.
Rainbow Dash,But I thought you said you were just at Applejack's.
Pinkie Pie,"Actually, I'm probably still on my way there now! Whee!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, Pinkie Pie, I'm so glad you wandered by. I know I promised not to have any fun today, but, oh, I couldn't help myself. All of my critter friends wanted a picnic, and I couldn't disappoint them. Come join us. We have plenty of hay juice and marmalade to go around, don't we, critters?"
Pinkie Pie 2,"[chomps] Wait, but that sounds super fun! Oh, but Applejohn sounds super fun too! Uh, and, and I can't do one without missing out on the other!"
Fluttershy,Who's Applejohn?
Pinkie Pie 2,"Two fun things at once? But which, which? Oh, can't decide... [breathes heavily] Trouble breathing... Walls closing in!"
Fluttershy,Walls? But we're outside.
Fluttershy,Goodness. Was it something I said?
Pinkie Pie 2,Yes!
Fluttershy,Huh?
Pinkie Pie,"So you see, that's how I'm able to have fun in two places at once."
Rainbow Dash,"Duplicates of you, huh? Heh, yeah, sure, Pinkie. [yawns] Look, I was just gearing up to catch some Z's, so, uh..."
Pinkie Pie,Gotcha. I'll have the rest of my fun really quietly. [quietly] Wheeeee...
Rainbow Dash,How'd you do that?
Pinkie Pie,"Just trying to show a little consideration for my sleepy friend. Ooh, ooh, gotta run. Looks like I'm trying to get my attention. Excuse me."
Pinkie Pie 2,And me.
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, ooh, tell me all about it! Did they pull the walls of the barn up slow or fast?"
Pinkie Pie 2,I<U+0096>
Pinkie Pie,"Maybe slow to medium fast, somewhere in that range?"
Pinkie Pie 2,I<U+0096>
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, did you get ice cream? What kinds did they have? Banana brickle?"
Pinkie Pie 2,I didn't make it! I was on my way there and then Fluttershutter<U+0096>
Pinkie Pie,Fluttershy.
Pinkie Pie 2,"Yeah, her. She offered something else fun for me to do! A picnic, with cute little animals!"
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, how could you say no to that?"
Pinkie Pie 2,That's what I'm saying! Then I would've missed the super fun thing with Applesauce!
Pinkie Pie,Applejack.
Pinkie Pie 2,[bawling] So I didn't do anything fun at all!
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, my poor poor me! There, there. Tell me what, we just need a couple more Pinkie Pies. Easy peasy."
Pinkie Pie 2,Really?
Pinkie Pie,"Come on, would I lie to me?"
Pinkie Pie and Pinkie Pie 2,"""...and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"""
Pinkie Pie 2,"Look, a double me!"
Pinkie Pie,"I think you mean a double-double me. Plus another double-double me, which makes two double-double mes, or a double-double-double me, if you will."
Pinkie Pie 3,Did somebody say fun? Where? Fun fun fun fun fun!
Pinkie Pie,"Now Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy are covered, plus one extra Pinkie Pie in case we get an extra invite from somepony else. Perfect! Okay, let's go! [under] Hey, Pinkies! Yoo-hoo!"
Others,"Pinkie Pies 2, ""...and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"""
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, good enough. Pinkie Pies, move it out<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates,"""...not to be scared, at the prospect of being doubly mared!"""
Pinkie Pie,What in the name of pink?! Knock it off!
Pinkie Pie,"To Ponyville, everyone! Follow me!"
Pinkie Pie,"[sighs] Yes, it's fun there."
Pinkie Pie,"[whistles] Okay, between the bunch of us, we should have every nook and cranny of fun in Ponyville covered at all times. An unprecedented and massive undertaking! But first, a pop quiz on the names I taught you!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates,[in chorus] Applejack! Fluttershy! Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie,"Excellent. Okay, let's get on with this, folks. Fan out on three. One<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"Eh, good enough. La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, whee!"
Rainbow Dash,[sneezes] What the<U+0096>
Rainbow Dash,Wow! Pinkie Pie wasn't kidding about the duplicates! Except now there's triplicates... and quadruplicates!
Pinkie Pie,"Dash is gonna love this! Aw, if I push her around on this floaty thing, it'll be fun and relaxing!"
Pinkie Pie,Uh-oh...
Rainbow Dash,No more Pinkies! I can't take it!
Pinkie Pie,"Gosh, uh... I wonder what fun they're having raising the barn at Applejack's right now! Maybe I'd better go check!"
Applejack,No!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, phew! Looks like I haven't missed a thing!"
Applejack,"I wanna know right now where all you Pinkies came from, so I can find out who's responsible for y'all ruinin' our barn raisin'!"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, you look pretty busy right now, so [laughs nervously] maybe we should talk a little later?"
Pinkie Pie Duplicates,Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!
Applejack,Y'all come back here and clean up after yourselves this instant!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh no, what have I done, what have I done?! My poor friends..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, everypony, please, calm down!"
Rarity,Calm down? I just had a Pinkie hurricane raging through my shop!
Fluttershy,And they trashed our critter picnic!
Twilight Sparkle,"Please, everypony, hang on while I try to figure something out! Come on, Spike. I've gotta try to remember the name of that legend she mentioned."
Twilight Sparkle,"Aha, here it is! ""The legend of the Mirror Pond""... It describes a spell I can use to send them back where they came from!"
Spike,That's perfect! Let's go!
Twilight Sparkle,"But there's a catch. If I can't figure out which one's the real Pinkie, I might send her back by mistake!"
Spike,"Well, we'll just have to figure out who the real one is then. Shouldn't be too hard."
Twilight Sparkle,Does anypony here know how we can tell the real Pinkie Pie from all the rest of them?
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight! I have to talk to you, I need your help!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Excuse me, whoever you are, but I'm not talking to any of you Pinkies unless you're the real Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, but, but I am the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate,"No, you're not! I'm the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 2,I'm the real Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 3,"No, I'm the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 4,I'm the real Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 5,"No, I'm the real Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 6,I'm the real Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie Duplicates,Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!
Applejack,How in tarnation are we supposed to tell which is the real Pinkie?
Twilight Sparkle,I have no idea.
Pinkie Pie Duplicates,Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, this is hopeless!"
Spike,Maybe that one's the real Pinkie.
Twilight Sparkle,Please. The real Pinkie Pie never sat that long in one place her whole life!
Spike,I'm gonna go ask.
Twilight Sparkle,Of course she's gonna say she's the real Pinkie! They all do! You're wasting your time.
Spike,So lemme guess. You're the real Pinkie Pie.
Pinkie Pie,"Heck if I know. Could be any one of us if you ask me. And if I said I was the real Pinkie, you wouldn't even believe me anyway. So just leave me alone. I've got some important poking the ground with my hoof to do."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike, how're we gonna do this? I can't risk sending the real Pinkie back into the pond!"
Spike,I miss the real Pinkie.
Pinkie Pie,"[sighs] I bet she misses you too. Bet she'd do just about anything to get to be with her friends again. Hey. Hey! What if you gave them a test? Pick something really hard for a Pinkie to do, something not fun at all! Any Pinkie that can't do it goes back into the pond. But whoever wants to stay the most, that must be the real Pinkie!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, that's not a bad idea."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,I've been looking all over for you ponies. What are you all doing here?
Rainbow Dash,"Fluttershy spoke with the woodland critters, and they've agreed to take us into their home 'til the Pinkie storm dies down."
Twilight Sparkle,"You guys, we're gonna fix this. And I know exactly how."
Fluttershy,Are we gonna lose our real Pinkie Pie?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't think so. Now come along. I've already got Applejack and her family rounding up all the Pinkies.
Applejack,"Hyah, ya Pinkies! Hyah!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate,"Ooh, they wanna play chase! This is fun, too!"
Applejack,"Oh, give it a rest."
Twilight Sparkle,"Welcome, Pinkies, welcome. Please have a seat and make yourselves comfortable. [pause] Okay, I suppose you can't be comfortable staying in one place, but have a seat anyway. [pause] Sit down!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Better. Now, I suppose you're all wondering why I've gathered you all here today."
Pinkie Pie Duplicate,For fun?
Twilight Sparkle,"No, just the opposite actually."
Rainbow Dash,"Wait up, I got one more! Found this one poking at the ground with her hoof, drawing frowny faces."
Twilight Sparkle,Have her come sit with the others.
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkies, you've been brought here to take a test."
Pinkie Pie Duplicates,[in chorus] Awww!
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, it's a simple test, about as simple as they come, and whoever passes gets to stay."
Twilight Sparkle,"Curtain, please. The test... will be watching paint dry!"
Twilight Sparkle,"On your mark, get set, go!"
Spike,"Ooh, this is so exciting!"
Spike,"Okay, maybe not that exciting."
Pinkie Pie Duplicate,"Oh, hey, look at the birdie!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate,Watch me bounce and touch the ceiling!
Pinkie Pie Duplicate,Is that... is that a frog crossed with an orange?
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 2,Cool!
Pinkie Pie Duplicate 3,Where?
Pinkie Pie Duplicate,Betcha can't make a face crazier than... this!
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, I can't take it anymore! Somepony's making balloon animals!"
Pinkie Pie Duplicate,What? Where?
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, you can look away now."
Pinkie Pie,I passed?
Twilight Sparkle,You passed. You're the only Pinkie who kept staring at the wall.
Pinkie Pie,"I had to. I just had to. I couldn't leave my friends, I just couldn't. But I guess sometimes I will have to choose between them."
Twilight Sparkle,I knew you'd be up to the challenge.
Pinkie Pie,"I'm me! I'm me! I'm me! Or am I? Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am."
Pinkie Pie,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Pinkie Pie,"It's great to have fun, but it's even greater to have great friends. And having lots of friends means that you sometimes have to make choices as to who you'll spend your time with. But that's okay, because good friends will always give you lots of opportunities to have fun. So even if you're missing out, it's never for long."
Others,"Respectfully yours,"
Others,Pinkie Pie.
Twilight Sparkle,"Hi, Pinkie Pie. We were thinking we should go out and celebrate."
Applejack,You up for some wheelbarrow races?
Rainbow Dash,Or I could take everypony on a cloud ride!
Rarity,I could throw a party with punch and zesty cucumber sandwiches! Ooh!
Fluttershy,That looks like fun.
Applejack,"Oh, Pinkie."
Apple Bloom,"[whining] What to wear, what to wear? Oh, what to wear?!"
Applejack,"Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom. It's not like it's the Harvest Day Parade! We're just goin' to the train station!"
Apple Bloom,Too casual. Too summery.
Applejack,[sigh] Your cousin isn't gonna care what you're wearin'. Just pick somethin'!
Apple Bloom,"This is my first time meetin' her, and she's from Manehattan. I wanna make a good impression!"
Applejack,You know what would make a good impression?
Apple Bloom,What?
Applejack,Bein' on time to pick her up!
Applejack,"You got nothin' to worry about, sugarcube. Y'all are gonna get along great. You already have somethin' in common."
Apple Bloom,"[muffled, through snorkel] Oh, yeah? What's that?"
Applejack,Neither of you have your cutie mark.
Apple Bloom,What?! How could you forget to tell me somethin' like that?
Applejack,"Well, I<U+0096>"
Apple Bloom,"Oh, this changes everything! Meet you at the train station! I'm gonna go tell Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo!"
Applejack,"You know, your cousin is supposed to sleep in here!"
Scootaloo,Do you really think she'll wanna join?
Apple Bloom,She doesn't have her cutie mark. Of course she'll wanna join the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Sweetie Belle,I'm just so excited I could burst!
Apple Bloom,Is that the train from Manehattan?
Applejack,Yep.
Apple Bloom,"That's her! Oh, wait, no, no, that's not her. Oh! No, tha-tha-that's her! Um, no. Oh, wait, tha<U+0096> that's not her either, uh..."
Applejack,"Apple Bloom, you've never met Babs Seed, remember?"
Apple Bloom,Oh... [laughs nervously] Yeah.
Applejack,"Ah, that's her!"
Apple Bloom,"Babs! Babs! It's me, your cousin, Apple Bloom! And this is Sweetie Belle, and this is Scootaloo, and we are so, so, so glad you're here!"
Babs Seed,"Thanks, I'm happy to<U+0096>"
Sweetie Belle,This is gonna be the best week of your life!
Babs Seed,Sure hope it's gonna be<U+0096>
Scootaloo,"Seriously, we are gonna have a blast."
Sweetie Belle,The Summer Harvest Parade's going on while you're here! You'll get to ride in a float!
Babs Seed,Really? I've never been on a float before.
Apple Bloom,And we've got a really big surprise for you!
Babs Seed,Yeah... uh... a surprise?
Apple Bloom,I give you... the Cutie Mark Crusaders Clubhouse!
Babs Seed,The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
Scootaloo,A club devoted to helping ponies get their cutie marks! We're its founding members.
Sweetie Belle,"Technically, we're its only members."
Apple Bloom,"But we're always looking to expand, and you seem like the perfect candidate!"
Babs Seed,I do?
Scootaloo,"Well, yeah, since you don't have a cutie mark and all."
Babs Seed,"Oh, yeah... [blows] That..."
Apple Bloom,"Allow me to show you just some of the highlights of our clubhouse, should you choose to join us."
Apple Bloom,This is where we do our role call...
Apple Bloom,This is where we eat our lunch...
Apple Bloom,Sometimes we stand here and think of great ideas.
Babs Seed,"Yeah, uh..."
Apple Bloom,"Uh, could you excuse us for a moment?"
Babs Seed,Sure...
Apple Bloom,[hushed] Thought she'd be more impressed.
Sweetie Belle,"[hushed] She's from Manehattan. If we wanna impress her, we need to really wow her!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Hmmmm.
Scootaloo,[gasps] [hushed] The float! She can ride with us on our Summer Harvest Parade float!
Apple Bloom,[hushed] That's perfect! This really is a good spot for thinking up great ideas.
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Mm-hmm.
Apple Bloom,Here it is! The official Cutie Mark Crusaders float for the Summer Harvest Parade!
Scootaloo,"As a member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, you'd be able to ride on it with us! It'd be totally fun."
Diamond Tiara,More like funny...
Silver Spoon,"What is that thing, a giant orange?"
Apple Bloom,It's a pumpkin.
Diamond Tiara,More like a lame-kin.
Diamond Tiara,Who's the new blank flank?
Apple Bloom,"She's mah cousin, Babs. She's from Manehattan!"
Diamond Tiara,"Manehattan, huh? Well, I guess you have that going for you."
Silver Spoon,Suppose you're gonna join their little club? What's it called? The [mockingly] Cutie Mark Crusaders?
Apple Bloom,Hey!!
Diamond Tiara,"Oooo, heh, big city attitude! I like it!"
Silver Spoon,Mm-hmm!
Scootaloo,"Oh no, she didn't!"
Babs Seed,Looks like somepony's pumpkin just got squashed!
Apple Bloom,When ah tell Applejack<U+0096>
Babs Seed,You gonna tell Applejack what?
Apple Bloom,"W-well, y'know, uh..."
Babs Seed,"What're you, a snitch?"
Diamond Tiara,"Come on, Babs, you should hang with us! Y'know, the cool ponies, not these babies!"
Apple Bloom,What... just happened?
Scootaloo,I think Babs just went to the dark side.
Sweetie Belle,We have to tell Applejack!
Apple Bloom,No! We're not snitches!
Scootaloo,Yeah! And we're not babies!
Sweetie Belle,Then... why do I feel like crying?
Scootaloo,I still can't believe she ruined our pumpkin float.
Apple Bloom,I still can't believe I'm related to such a big stinkin' bully!
Sweetie Belle,[sighs] What are we gonna do?
Apple Bloom,"We're gonna build a new float, that's what."
Scootaloo,"Why bother? She'll probably just ruin that one, too."
Sweetie Belle,We could always tell Applejack.
Babs Seed,"[echoing] What are you, a snitch?"
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,No!
Apple Bloom,"We're not gonna be a bunch of tattle-tales! Besides, she's only here a couple of weeks. We'll just avoid her like the plague until she goes home."
Scootaloo,"Avoid her. Yeah, how hard can that be?"
Others,"[Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo] Yeah, yeah, yeah<U+00A0> Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Apple Bloom,"First, we thought that Babs was so really, really sweet A new friend to have, and it seemed like such a treat"
Scootaloo,"But then, we found the truth; she's just a bully from the east She went from Babs, yeah, to a bully and a beast"
Apple Bloom,"Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead"
Others,"[Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo] Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do? Got a bully on our tail Gotta hide, we gotta bail Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you Gotta run, we gotta flee Gotta hurry, don't you see? Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad seed"
Others,"Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Apple Bloom,"Hiding from a bully, we know it isn't right But the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we aren't lookin' for a fight"
Scootaloo,"Oh, she'll go home soon, and then we'll have some peace again But for now, we're staying out of her way 'til then"
Apple Bloom,"Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead"
Others,"[Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo] Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do? Got a bully on our tail Gotta hide, we gotta bail Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you Gotta run, we gotta flee Gotta hurry, don't you see?"
Others,Why so mean? Why so crude? Why so angry? Why so rude? Can't you be nice? Can't we be friends? Isn't it sad? Is this how it all ends?
Others,"Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad- Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad- Babs Seed, Babs Seed-"
Scootaloo,"She's just a bad, bad seed!"
Apple Bloom,"Babs may have run us out of town, but at least we still have the club<U+0096>"
Babs Seed,Hey! What're you doing at my clubhouse?
Scootaloo,Y- y- your clubhouse?! This is our clubhouse!
Babs Seed,"Well, it was yours, and now it's mine."
Silver Spoon,And mine.
Diamond Tiara,And mine.
Apple Bloom,"That's not fair, Babs! We never did anything to you!"
Babs Seed,"And let's keep it that way. Now scram, crybabies!"
Others,"Babs Seed, Bump, bump, sugar-lump, rump!"
Apple Bloom,That Babs has really gone too far this time!
Scootaloo,Kicked out of our own clubhouse!
Apple Bloom,And my own bed!
Scootaloo,Seriously?
Apple Bloom,Super-seriously.
Sweetie Belle,We need to talk to Applejack.
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,No!
Sweetie Belle,Rarity?
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,No!
Sweetie Belle,Twilight?
Apple Bloom,"No, no, no! We need to fight back!"
Scootaloo,Yeah! Fight back! How're we gonna do that?
Apple Bloom,[gasp] By makin' her the guest of honor at the Summer Harvest Parade!
Scootaloo,"[gasps] Yeah! Wait, what?"
Apple Bloom,[laughs under her breath] When you look up 'embarrassed' in the dictionary... [deep breath] Her face will be there!
Sweetie Belle,Moo! Moo!
Sweetie Belle,Moo! Moo!
Apple Bloom,Are those from the Carousel Boutique?
Sweetie Belle,Yup.
Apple Bloom,Excellent.
Sweetie Belle,Ooh!
Scootaloo,Luster dust from Sugarcube Corner. They use it for decorating cakes.
Sweetie Belle,That must be what Rarity uses on her emergency edible boots!
Scootaloo,"The gears and bands for the moving mechanism, my tools and stuff... Did you bring the thing from the place?"
Sweetie Belle,What's that?
Apple Bloom,Granny Smith's kitchen timer.
Sweetie Belle,What's that for?
Apple Bloom,"C'mon, y'all, let's get to it. We only got a few hours before mornin', and this thing has to look so good, Babs won't be able to resist wanting to ride in it!"
Sweetie Belle,[yawns] Is this it?
Scootaloo,[tired] I think... we're a go.
Sweetie Belle,"[tired] Good, 'cause we'd better get out of here before Babs finds us."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"[tired] Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho!"
Others,"""Roma"": Hot carrot cr<ea>pes! Get 'em here, get 'em hot!"
Babs Seed,[blows] Whoaaaa...
Sweetie Belle,"Isn't it smashing? No! I-I didn't mean smashing! I mean... Isn't it a hit? No! No, I- No! No hitting! I meant<U+0096>"
Scootaloo,"Well, don't even think about riding it, Babs."
Sweetie Belle,Ow!
Scootaloo,You had your chance.
Babs Seed,"See ya later, Cutie Mark Crybabies!"
Apple Bloom,[hushed] The timer set?
Sweetie Belle,Teach her to fool with the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Applejack,Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float?
Apple Bloom,Yeah. We thought she deserved to be the... center of attention.
Applejack,"Well, that's just super sweet of y'all, makin' Babs feel so special. Y'know, after all the heartache she's been havin' in Manehattan."
Apple Bloom,Heartache?
Applejack,"Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in Manehattan just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank."
Apple Bloom,T-t-t-teased?
Sweetie Belle,B-Bullies?!
Applejack,Yup. She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home. I'm so proud of y'all. You've done a good deed.
Scootaloo,So that's why she jumped in when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon started giving us a hard time.
Apple Bloom,"She didn't want to be bullied like at home, so she decided to be a bully instead!"
Sweetie Belle,And now we've turned into bullies too!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,What do we do?!
Diamond Tiara,"Nice float, Babs."
Babs Seed,Snagged it from those whiny baby blank flanks.
Diamond Tiara,"Too cool for mule, Babs."
Apple Bloom,We gotta stop that float!
Apple Bloom,"[almost inaudible] Applejack, quick you have to<U+0096>"
Applejack,Huh?
Apple Bloom,"[almost inaudible] Quick, you have to help us<U+0096>"
Applejack,What?
Apple Bloom,We booby-trapped it!
Scootaloo,Babs! Bully! Payback! No time to explain! We've just gotta get Babs out of that float!
Spectator,"Oof, my popcorn!"
Apple Bloom,Sorry!
Scootaloo,"'Scuse me! Ah, whoops."
Apple Bloom,Whoa!
Scootaloo,"Pinkie Pie, let us in! (""lettuce in"")"
Pinkie Pie,[laughs] Funny joke!
Apple Bloom,"No, really! Let- us- in!"
Pinkie Pie,Ohhh! Here!
Apple Bloom,Babs! You gotta get out of that float!
Babs Seed,"You're not getting your float back, crybabies!"
Sweetie Belle,But it's booby tra<U+0096>
Pinkie Pie,Veggie salad!
Apple Bloom,Huh?
Pinkie Pie,Veggie salad!
Apple Bloom,Seriously?
Babs Seed,What the<U+0096>
Apple Bloom,Babs! Babs!
Babs Seed,Oof!
Apple Bloom,"[yelling] Oooh, sweet applesauce!"
Apple Bloom,Maybe we'll get our cutie marks in stupidest ideas of all time.
Applejack,Are y'all okay?
Sweetie Belle,Yeah... we're fine.
Scootaloo,No sweat.
Babs Seed,After I'd been so mean to ya... you saved me!
Apple Bloom,[sighs] About that...
Babs Seed,I don't get it! I saw it all happen! You pushed me out just when the float was about to head into the lake!
Scootaloo,Except... we were the reason it was headed into the lake.
Sweetie Belle,We booby trapped the float.
Apple Bloom,"Y'see Babs, we were tryin' to get you back for bein' a big bully..."
Scootaloo,But then Applejack told us about how you were being bullied back in Manehattan.
Sweetie Belle,"And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville. But, by then... we were the ones being bullies. And... Oh, why does life have to be so ironic?!"
Apple Bloom,Guess what we're trying to say is...
Cutie Mark Crusaders,We're sorry.
Babs Seed,[blows] I'm sorry too.
Applejack,"[sighs] Y'know, this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning."
Sweetie Belle,That's what I kept on saying!
Babs Seed,So... can we... start over?
Apple Bloom,Definitely.
Scootaloo,Yeah.
Sweetie Belle,"""We, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, elect Babs Seed to join us as a sister, friend, confidaynte, alley, boss-om buddy, gal pal, compader, chum of chums..."""
Sweetie Belle,Well you wrote this.
Scootaloo,"Oh, uh, yeah..."
Sweetie Belle,"""Homegirl... Amiga..."" Blah blah blah blah blah. Oh, yes, here. ""...and fellow Cutie Mark Crusader! You are solemnly sworn in, here this day, in witness of your fellow sisters, friends, confidantes... boss-om buddies... compadres..."""
Scootaloo,"Congratulations! [quickly, under her breath] Gotta remember to revise that."
Apple Bloom,"So you promise you're gonna start our Manehattan branch of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, right?"
Babs Seed,"Yeah, and I promise to keep talking to my big sis about the teasing back home."
Applejack,"Good. And if you have any problems, we've got your back too, y'hear?"
Diamond Tiara,So you're leaving huh? Great! Now we're stuck here with these lame blank flanks.
Babs Seed,Hey! That's not how you talk to my friends!
Silver Spoon,F-friends?
Babs Seed,"Yeah, you got a problem with that?"
Diamond Tiara,"Well, what if I do? What are you gonna do about it?"
Babs Seed,Tell your mothers about your bad attitudes!
Sweetie Belle,I'm sure gonna miss that bad seed.
Applejack,Bad seed? I thought y'all were friends now?
Sweetie Belle,"No, see, first we called her 'bad seed' as in actually a bad seed, but now she's bad as in good. Get it?"
Applejack,Yea... No.
Shopkeeper,"May I help you, traveler? Hmm, something drew you to my shop... something powerful. Ah, you have a keen eye. The Alicorn Amulet is one of the most mysterious and powerful of all the known magical charms. Uh, ah<U+0097> I'm afraid this is... far too dangerous."
Shopkeeper,[quickly] Would you like that gift-wrapped?
Fluttershy,"Don't be scared, little friends. Twilight is wonderful with magic. [to Twilight] Anything happens to them, Twilight, so help me..."
Spike,"Aww, don't worry, Fluttershy, Twilight's magic has gotten a lot better since she accidentally crushed me and Applejack with a giant snowball."
Fluttershy,"Of course she's good with magic. Twilight's great with magic. I guess I just don't want my little friends to be scared. Oh, oh, look how scared they are!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I promise, Fluttershy. Nothing bad will happen to them."
Fluttershy,"[high-pitched] I know! Stop, stop! They can't take it!"
Spike,"Twilight, that looks amazing!"
Twilight Sparkle,Phew!
Twilight Sparkle,"That's all for now, little ones. Maybe we can practice again later, if Fluttershy says it's alright."
Spike,"Your magic has really improved since we came to Ponyville, Twilight. Princess Celestia's going to love it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks, Spike. I have to be at my best when she arrives with the delegates from Saddle Arabia. I can't believe she's trusting me with the entertainment."
Rainbow Dash,Twilight! Come quick! It's an emergency!
Rarity,[gasp] You beast! This shade of brown should only be used for accents!
Pinkie Pie,"Come on, Applejack. We've got to get her in a nice, soothing pink, stat!"
Twilight Sparkle,What's going on here?
Trixie,"Well, well, well. If it isn't... Twilight Sparkle."
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Trixie!
Spike,What's she doing here?
Rainbow Dash,You call that great and powerful?
Snips,"Oh! She's Rainbow Wobble, now!"
Snails,Yeah! Ha ha ha ha!
Snails,"Good spell, oh Great and Powerful Trixie!"
Trixie,You two! Quiet!
Snips,"Uh, hey! W<U+0097> What happened?"
Snails,Get off of me! Brbrbr.
Snips,Let go!
Snails,Go this way!
Twilight Sparkle,"Stop picking on my friends, Trixie!"
Trixie,"You and I have some unfinished business. My magic's gotten better since I was here last. And I'm going to prove it! Me and you, a magic duel. Winner stays, loser leaves Ponyville forever!"
Twilight Sparkle,Forget it! I'd never make a deal like that!
Trixie,Hm. Your choice.
Twilight Sparkle,"Trixie, put him down. Why are you doing this?"
Trixie,"Why? Because you humiliated me! After you showed me up with that Ursa Minor, I became a laughing stock! Everywhere I went I was laughed at and ostracized. I even had to take a job on a rock farm just to earn a living! A rock farm!"
Pinkie Pie,Hey! You're lucky a rock farm would take the likes of you!
Trixie,Now I want revenge! And I'll just keep casting spells 'til you agree. Well? What do you say?
Spike,Whoooaah! Help... me!
Twilight Sparkle,"Alright, Trixie. Let's duel!"
Trixie,Excellent.
Trixie,"If I lose, I won't set hoof in Ponyville again. But if you lose, you're the one banished from this one-horse town!"
Trixie,Draw!
Trixie,"Snips, Snails, step forward!"
Twilight Sparkle,An age spell? But... how could you do an age spell? That's only for the highest level unicorns!
Trixie,"Well, Twilight? Give up?"
Spike,"Come on, Twilight, you can do it!"
Trixie,Trixie is the highest level unicorn! [laughs] And now it's time for you to leave Ponyville! FOREVER!
Applejack,"That's enough, Trixie!"
Rarity,"You proved your point, but you can't possibly expect Twilight to leave Ponyville!"
Trixie,You fools! She's already gone!
Twilight Sparkle,"It's okay, guys. I'll figure something out. Just take care of each other. And keep an eye on Trixie. There's something strange about her."
Twilight Sparkle,"[grunts of exertion] Ugh! It's impossible! How could Trixie know such advanced magic? Without Spike, I can't get a message to the Princess in Saddle Arabia. So who else do I know who understands strange and powerful magic?"
Zecora,Your tale of woe upsets me so. [sips] No wonder you're dour. It's an abuse of power!
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know what to do, Zecora. I feel like I've abandoned my friends. But I can't take her on horn-to-horn."
Zecora,"[sips] If you train with me, so good you'll be. I'll show you the way to make sure she won't stay."
Twilight Sparkle,"You'll train me in magic? But she was doing age spells, weather spells, you name it!"
Zecora,"When it comes to magic, it would be tragic if somepony licked me, especially Trixie."
Twilight Sparkle,You really think I can beat her?
Zecora,Mm-hmm.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, when do we start?"
Trixie,You two! Hurry up with my throne.
Trixie,"And you, how long do I have to wait for my applesauce facial?"
Applejack,"Forget it, Trixie! I ain't doing nothin' 'til you let Twilight come home! [laughs uncontrollably] Okay, I'll do it! Just make it stop! Hoo!"
Trixie,I thought I told you to dance!
Rarity,"Oh, Trixie's cruel magic is ruining Ponyville. Ow! [whines] Oh, somepony has to help us!"
Zecora,"Ah, no noise, no sound, no din, no fuss must interfere with your focus. Unlearn what you have learned. Only then can victory be earned."
Zecora,"There is much, much that I can teach, but the answer you need may still be out of reach."
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Zecora. I'm trying my best, but... I can't stop thinking about Trixie. There was something different about her. It's like she's gone from high and mighty to mean and nasty."
Zecora,Your thinking needs a readjust. Total concentration is a must.
Rarity,"Ugh, this really doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere."
Applejack,"I hear you, Pinkie. I can't find anything that describes the kind of magic Trixie's doin'."
Spike,"Ugh, there must be something! Twilight has every magic book there is!"
Fluttershy,"[quietly] Um, I think I may have found something?"
Rarity,"Yes, it's time for us to consider our futures in this new Trixie-led Ponyville."
Fluttershy,"[quietly] Um, this sounds an awful lot like Trixie's magic<U+0096>"
Applejack,She wants me to grow apples with no peels! Now how the hay am I supposed to do that?
Fluttershy,"[quietly] Um, there's a picture here of that necklace<U+0096>"
Fluttershy,"[quietly] It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold<U+0097>"
Spike,"Hey, everypony, look! This book has a picture of Trixie's necklace! It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold powers!"
Fluttershy,"[quietly] If you read a little further, you'll see<U+0097>"
Rarity,"[reading] Even though it provides great power, it also corrupts the user!"
Fluttershy,"[quietly] Yes, but, um, you can't<U+0097>"
Spike,"[reading] You can't just take the Alicorn Amulet off her neck, it has a magical lock! Trixie's the only pony who can take it off!"
Fluttershy,[quietly] Maybe we could<U+0097>
Applejack,We need to get this information to Twilight. She'll know what to do.
Fluttershy,"[quietly] But, h<U+0097> how<U+0097>"
Rarity,"If any of us try to leave, Trixie's magical force field will tell her!"
Fluttershy,[quietly] Maybe we should<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"I've got it! Trying to sneak past the force field would be impossible without help, but I know who's got the goods to get into those woods!"
Fluttershy,[quietly] It<U+0097> it must be<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,Fluttershy!
Fluttershy,Whaaat?!
Applejack,"What do you say, Fluttershy? Can you handle the mission?"
Fluttershy,No! I'll crack under the pressure! I'll snap like a twig!
Rainbow Dash,Perfect! Fluttershy'll sneak out of Ponyville and find Twilight.
Fluttershy,"But<U+0097> but I, I<U+0097>"
Fluttershy,[teeth chattering] [sighs] Okay.
Applejack,Alright!
Rarity,I know just the design for a dangerous mission outfit!
Trixie,"Pull, you fools! [cracks whip] Somepony set off the magic force field, and Trixie intends to punish them!"
Snips,[gasping] But... wouldn't it be faster if we had some... wheels?!
Trixie,The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't trust wheels. Now pull faster!
Snails,"[gasping] I'm telling ya, Snips, she's getting weirder and weirder!"
Trixie,Stop! You there! What are you doing?!
Snails,"Gah, why is she so mean to us?"
Snips,Yeah! I miss the days when she was just a fraud!
Fluttershy,"Oh, okay, okay, you're right. I need to be brave and find Twilight."
Fluttershy,Oh! Y<U+0097> you found her?
Fluttershy,She's in the Everfree Forest?!
Fluttershy,"Oh, this is me being brave! I wanna be brave at home, locked in my closet, with my teddy bear!"
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet!
Fluttershy,"The more she uses it, the more it will corrupt her!"
Twilight Sparkle,But how am I supposed to beat that amulet? My magic's not good enough!
Zecora,"Twilight Sparkle, much work have you done. You learned all of my lessons; all but one. If Trixie's tricks have you in a fix, you must nix your magic and use the six."
Twilight Sparkle,"Nix your magic, use the six... Nix your magic, use the six! Use the six! That's it! Zecora, you're a genius! Now we'll need to get you back inside Ponyville, Fluttershy."
Trixie,"This better not be another false alarm, or the Great and Powerful Trixie will<U+0096> [gasps] You! [muffled] What's the matter, Twilight Sparkle? Not enjoying your exile?"
Twilight Sparkle,I know about the Alicorn Amulet. I know you cheated.
Trixie,Cheated? Moi?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah. And I thought you might wanna see what a real magical amulet looks like. Zecora gave it to me. [muffled] It's from beyond the Everfree Forest, [normal] and it's way more powerful than your measly little Alicorn Amulet!"
Trixie,Ha! Nothing's more powerful than the Alicorn Amulet! And nopony's more powerful than the Great and Powerful Trixie!
Twilight Sparkle,[muffled] Care to put your amulet where your mouth is? [normal] How about another duel?
Trixie,[muffled] Why should I? I already beat you.
Twilight Sparkle,"That's up to you! But I guess you'll never see the totally awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest. Come on, Zecora."
Trixie,Wait!
Trixie,"Okay, okay, you're on! A second duel."
Trixie,"Let's start with a simple age spell, shall we?"
Twilight Sparkle,Let's.
Trixie,"Snips, Snails."
Trixie,"An oldie, but a goodie, ha. Now, let's see what your little charm can do."
Twilight Sparkle,"No problem. Um, Applejack, Rarity? Could you help me, please?"
Applejack,Huh?
Rarity,Huh?
Trixie,"Oh, ho-hum. So you can do an age spell, big deal."
Trixie,That's... That's impossible!
Twilight Sparkle,That's nothing!
Rainbow Dash,Yow!
Trixie,How did you<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,Duplication spell. Ever see one pony play ten instruments?
Trixie,This... just can't be!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ooh, one more. I can turn a mare into a stallion."
Others,Big McIntosh (as Male Applejack): (nervously) Eeyup.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet is more powerful than yours<U+0096> Hey! Give it back!"
Trixie,"[laughs] With this amulet, I shall now rule all of Equestria!"
Trixie,"Witness, my subjects. Gaze upon an ever greater and 'powerful-er' Trixie!"
Trixie,Hey! [scoffs] I don't need that old Alicorn Amulet. I have this!
Rainbow Dash,[laughs] Stop it! Tha<U+0097> that tickles!
Trixie,Tickles?! That was supposed to make you writhe in agony! This amulet is defective! [magic zap] Give mine back!
Rainbow Dash,Sorry. This is going back into hiding where it belongs.
Twilight Sparkle,"By the way, Trixie, the amulet around your neck? It's one of Zecora's doorstops."
Trixie,[upset] But... how did you do those spells? Nopony can do those spells!
Twilight Sparkle,"You're right. Not even me. Zecora taught me so much about magic while I was in exile. She even taught me when not to use it. My magic alone wasn't powerful enough to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head, so I needed to use a different kind of magic <U+0096> the magic of friendship. I also knew that the only pony who could get the amulet off your neck was you."
Trixie,But... what about the pony with the ten instruments?
Twilight Sparkle,That's not magic. That was just Pinkie Pie.
Saddle Arabian delegates,Oooh!
Twilight Sparkle,Trixie?
Trixie,"It's the least I could do. I treated you and your friends so horribly when I was wearing that Alicorn Amulet. I just couldn't control myself. You can forgive me, can't you?"
Twilight Sparkle,Hmmm. Sure.
Trixie,"Oh, good. Don't you think the Great and Apologetic Trixie is the most magnificent humble pony you've ever seen?!"
Scootaloo,Whoo-hoo!
Rainbow Dash,"[sips] Nice moves, kid."
Scootaloo,Nice moves? Rainbow Dash thinks I've got<U+0096>
Scootaloo,[gasps] ...nice moves!
Scootaloo,"...Then, all of a sudden, I'm airborne! And Rainbow Dash looks over and was like, ""Nice moves, kid."""
Apple Bloom,Woooow.
Sweetie Belle,She really said that?
Scootaloo,"I mean, it's like she practically told me she wanted to take me under her wing, teach me everything she knows, and become like my big sister!"
Apple Bloom,I dunno about all that.
Sweetie Belle,"It was a really nice compliment and all, but..."
Scootaloo,"I know, I know. But all that stuff I said could happen, right?"
Apple Bloom,Sure.
Sweetie Belle,Absolutely.
Scootaloo,"I just need to find a way to spend some time with her, y'know, so she can see more of my awesomeness."
Apple Bloom,"Well... Applejack and I are supposed to be campin' up at Winsome Falls this weekend. Maybe I could get my big sis to invite Rainbow Dash, and then you could come, too!"
Scootaloo,Really?!
Apple Bloom,Sure!
Sweetie Belle,I wanna go...
Apple Bloom,"Well, duh, of course you can go!"
Sweetie Belle,And I'll get Rarity to come too! Rarity loves camping!
Rarity,I despise camping! All of that... [shudders] ...nature.
Rarity,"Oh, all right! Ooh! Of course I will need to find an outfit more appropriate for 'roughing it'. Ooh!"
Sweetie Belle,See? Told you she'd wanna go.
Applejack,You packed bug spray?
Apple Bloom,Yup. You got the canteens?
Applejack,Yup. Looks like we're all set then.
Rarity,Hey!
Applejack,"Gee, Rarity, did you remember to pack?"
Rarity,"Oh, well, let's see who gets the last laugh when you're absolutely desperate to curl your lashes, and you realize you didn't bring your eyelash curler."
Applejack,"Well, looks like we're all set now."
Scootaloo,But what about Rainbow Dash? Isn't Rainbow Dash coming?
Applejack,"'Course she is, sugarcube. She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite."
Scootaloo,Oh.
Applejack,"Alright, y'all, let's move 'em out!"
Rarity,"Oh, are we there yet?"
Applejack,"The last thousand times you asked that, the answer was no. This time, it's actually yes. There's Rainbow Dash up there right now."
Scootaloo,"[quietly] Alright, Scootaloo, just play it cool. [normal] Hey Rai<U+0096>"
Scootaloo,"[clears throat] Hey, Rainbow Dash! What's up?"
Rainbow Dash,What took you guys so long?
Applejack,"Well, some of us didn't pack as light as the others. So we were slowed down a bit."
Rainbow Dash,"Looks like you'll be sharing a tent with me, huh?"
Scootaloo,"Heh, if that's okay with you."
Rainbow Dash,"Sure! Long as you don't snore. You don't snore, do you?"
Scootaloo,Nope. No way. Not me. Never snored a day or [laughs nervously] night in my life.
Rainbow Dash,Then you and I are gonna get along just fine.
Rainbow Dash,You have got to be kidding me.
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle, do be a dear and see if you can find some fresh flowers for my bedside vase."
Rainbow Dash,"[mimicking Rarity] Scootaloo, do be a sweetheart and see if you can gather some firewood."
Rainbow Dash,Seriously though. Can you get us some wood for the fire?
Scootaloo,Of course!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, everybody get comfortable, 'cause I'm about to tell you the best story you've ever heard."
Scootaloo,"Is it about the time when Rarity had wings, and then they got ruined, and then you saved her from plummeting to her doom?"
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, maybe it's the second best story you've ever heard. But probably still the scariest. [spookily] You like scary stories, right?"
Scootaloo,[gasps] Mm-hmm.
Rainbow Dash,"It all happened on a night just like this one, in a forest, just like this..."
Rainbow Dash,"...And then, The Olden Pony asked, [mimicking aged voice] ""Who's got my rusty horseshoe?"""
Sweetie Belle,Not me!
Rainbow Dash,You do!
Scootaloo,"[clears throat] Something in my throat. I wasn't scared at all, heheh. Good story."
Rainbow Dash,"Knew you wouldn't be scared. The way you jumped that cart the other day, you're like me <U+0096> fearless."
Rarity,[coddling] Don't worry. Rarity is here to keep you safe and sound. Ooh!
Applejack,[yawns] Think it's about time for me to hit the straw.
Applejack,"Don't you worry, little sis. There's no 'Olden Pony' in our tent."
Scootaloo,"[nervously] Haa, that sure was funny, wasn't it? Heheh. How they were all afraid of The Olden Pony? Heh, but not me, heh!"
Rainbow Dash,"That's because you're tough, just like when I was your age!"
Rainbow Dash,I'm hitting the sack. Come in whenever you feel like it.
Scootaloo,"[nervously] It's, it's nothing... Just my imagination..."
Scootaloo,[nervously] And that isn't the thundering stomp of The Olden Pony...
Scootaloo,I-Is anyone out there?
The Olden Pony,Who got my rusty horseshoe?
The Olden Pony,Who's got my rusty horseshoe?
Scootaloo,[cries] [dash] [panting] Rainbow Dash<U+0096>?
The Olden Pony,You do!
Rainbow Dash,"[yawns] What's that noise? Is there a bug in here? [sighs] I dunno about you, but I slept like a filly."
Scootaloo,[nervously] Best night ever.
Rainbow Dash,"Glad you're rested up, because we've got a long trek ahead. Totally gonna be worth it when we get to Winsome Falls."
Rarity,"Ohh... Am I sweating? Oh! I think I'm sweating! Oh, uh, but it's absolutely worth it to get to spend time with my little sister. It's just that this cart feels like it's getting heavier all the time!"
Applejack,"I don't care if that's cart's as heavy as a pack of mules. If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to the campsite!"
Scootaloo,"[gasps] Dark?! [wings buzzing] I'll just ride ahead and make sure the path is clear. We don't wanna be out here after dark, right?"
Rainbow Dash,Doesn't matter to me.
Scootaloo,"Well, y'know, [hushed] it's for the scaredy-ponies, heheh."
Rarity,[fades in] That's why it's always important to bring your own trunk on any public outing.
Scootaloo,"[gasps] Um... don't come this way! Take the path! It's, heh, way better than going through the bushes."
Applejack,"You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day. What gives, Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo,"Heh, nothing, just thought I heard something, aheh."
Applejack,You sure you're okay? You seem a little jumpy.
Scootaloo,"Just getting my exercise! You know how important it is to stretch out those hindquarters every so often, aheh."
Scootaloo,"Uh, d-do you need a little help?"
Rarity,"That's so sweet, thank you."
Applejack,"No need for tents tonight, y'all. We'll just take shelter in that cave."
Rainbow Dash,"All right! A deep, dark cave! Perfect for the story I've got for tonight. All we need is a campfire, and we're good to go."
Scootaloo,"[gulps] [nervously] Uh, of course..."
Scootaloo,[nervously] I'll be right back with lots of firewood from the deep... dark... not-scary-at-all forest!
Rainbow Dash,Thanks.
Scootaloo,"[breathing heavily] [sighs] Okay. I can do this. On the count of three, I get those branches. One... two... three! [trembling] [sighs] [nervously] Here, branches branches branches..."
Applejack,Bbbbrrr! Hoo-wee! It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail. Bbbrr! Where's that Scootaloo?
Scootaloo,[panicked laughing] Here you go!
Rainbow Dash,That's it?
Scootaloo,"It's all I could find, 'cause, y'know, there aren't that many trees around here!"
Applejack,It's all we need. Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while?
Scootaloo,"Hey, I have an idea! How about I tell tonight's story?"
Rainbow Dash,"Alright, just make sure it's a horrible one."
Scootaloo,"There once was a really really nice pony who lived in a bright and sunny land, where there are rainbows every day, and lots and lots of happy friends, and<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,"No offense, but it's not a real campfire story unless somepony's shaking. [spookily] I've been told that these very woods are haunted..."
Rainbow Dash,[spookily] ...by The Headless Horse! It gallops only at night<U+0096>
Applejack,"If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'?"
Rainbow Dash,"It's headless, not brainless. [spookily] ...looking for little lost ponies<U+0096>"
Applejack,So where's its brain?
Rainbow Dash,[spookily] [crossfades in] ...and they were never heard from ever again!
Sweetie Belle,[gasps] Never?
Rainbow Dash,Never.
Rarity,"Don't worry, you'll be safe with me tonight."
Scootaloo,"It's not time for bed yet, is it?"
Applejack,"'Fraid so, Scootaloo."
Sweetie Belle,You don't have to ask me twice!
Rarity,"Good night, Sweetie Belle."
Applejack,"Good night, y'all."
Apple Bloom,"Good night, y'all."
Rainbow Dash,Sleep tight.
Scootaloo,"Oh, just one more song! Anyone? [whoosh] How about a dance contest? I know you love to cut a rug, so how 'bout we mess up a cave floor? I have a brilliant idea! Hide and seek! Who's with me?"
Apple Bloom,[yawns] Maybe tomorrow.
Scootaloo,Aww.
Applejack,Seems like you don't really wanna go to sleep tonight. Is there some reason why?
Scootaloo,"Pfft, of course not! I just love camping and hanging out with Rainbow Dash so much that I don't wanna waste a single minute with sleep! [yawns] Heh, silly sleep."
Rainbow Dash,"That's cool and all, Scoot, but this pony needs her shut-eye and she needs it now!"
Scootaloo,"[gasps] If The Headless Horse catches me, I'm never gonna be heard from again! And I wanna be heard from! Woah, woaaah! Ugh! [grunts] Woah!"
Scootaloo,[panting] Aaah!
Princess Luna,"[echoing] A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo."
Scootaloo,Princess Luna! I thought you were The Headless Horse!
Princess Luna,"You were mistaken, but I hope not disappointed."
Scootaloo,"You are so, so much better than The Headless Horse. But what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in Canterlot?"
Princess Luna,I am the princess of the night. Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams.
Scootaloo,"Oh, yeah... Wait, is this just a dream? But it feels so real!"
Princess Luna,"I assure you that you are asleep. But when you awake, the thing that frightens you most will still exist."
Scootaloo,[nervously] Eh... The Headless Horse?
Princess Luna,Hmmm... Is The Headless Horse really what frightens you the most?
Scootaloo,Mm-mm. I'm afraid Rainbow Dash will find out I'm not as tough as she thinks I am.
Princess Luna,"Everypony has fears, Scootaloo. Everypony must face them in their own way. But they must be faced, or the nightmares will continue."
Princess Luna,Face your fears!
Scootaloo,<U+0096>Princess Luna?! [sighs] It was just a dream.
Scootaloo,"[gasps] But The Headless Horse isn't! Rainbow Dash said it lives here, in these very woods!"
Scootaloo,"[panting] So it's a horse without a head... which means it doesn't have a mouth... and if it doesn't have a mouth, then... it's not a horse-eat-pony kind of horse... but still... it's a horse without a head!"
Scootaloo,Hello?! Is anyone out there? [nervously] Anyone except The Headless Horse?
Scootaloo,Heellllp<U+0096>
Rainbow Dash,I gotcha!
Scootaloo,"Rainbow Dash! Is that you? Thank you, thank you!"
Rainbow Dash,What were you doing out here in the middle of the night?!
Princess Luna,"[echoing] It is time for you to face your real fear, Scootaloo!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, I'm gonna tell you something, but if you ever tell anypony else, I'm gonna deny it. First time I heard those stories... I was scared too."
Scootaloo,[sniffles] You were?
Rainbow Dash,"Sure! I mean, I got over it because I realized pretty quick that if there was such thing as a Headless Horse, I could totally take it on. So, you're looking for somepony to take you under their wing, huh?"
Scootaloo,Mm-hmm.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I might be up for something like that."
Scootaloo,Really?
Rainbow Dash,As long as you don't go falling into any more rivers in the middle of the night.
Scootaloo,[giggles] It's a deal!
Sweetie Belle,I call sister teams! Last herd to make it to the falls is a moldy carrot!
Rarity,"Ugh, if you insist. [giggles] It is so on!"
Rainbow Dash,They think they can beat the two of us?
The Olden Pony,[grumbling] Who's got my rusty horseshoe?
Rainbow Dash,"Here it is, for pony's sake. Now take it and stop all your moaning."
The Olden Pony,"Thank you, and have a nice day."
Pinkie Pie,"Ooooh, I wish the mailpony would just come already! I can't wait another minute to find out if Rainbow Dash got in or not!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you're more nervous than Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,I'm not nervous at all. When I get into the Wonderbolt Academy...
Pinkie Pie,IF you get in! If you get in! Don't jinx it!
Rainbow Dash,"I'm telling you, it's in the bag."
Pinkie Pie,Don't jinx it!
Applejack,She is the best flyer in Ponyville.
Rainbow Dash,In Ponyville? I'm probably the best flyer in all of Equestria. I wouldn't be surprised if they just went ahead and made me a Wonderbolt on the first day.
Messenger Pony,Got a letter here for Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash,I... didn't get in.
Rainbow Dash,"Gotcha! Ha, you guys are so gullible. Like I wasn't gonna get in!"
Pinkie Pie,I'm just sooooooooooo happy for you!
Rainbow Dash,Uh... thanks?
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie Pie? I kinda need to get going.
Pinkie Pie,Okay. I'm done!
Rainbow Dash,"The sooner I get there, the sooner I get to show 'em my stuff! See you guys in a week!"
Applejack,Good luck!
Rainbow Dash,Won't need it!
Pinkie Pie,DON'T FORGET TO WRITE!!! [echoing] [to others] Do you think she heard me?
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, yeah! This is gonna be sweet!"
Spitfire,"Well, lookie what we got here. Bet y'all think you're Wonderbolt material, don't ya?"
All Pegasi,"Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire,Think you got what it takes to be an elite flyer?
All Pegasi,"Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire,"Well then. Let me be the first to tell you... You don't! If you had what it took to be an elite flyer, you'd already be a Wonderbolt! Still think you're something special?"
Cloudchaser,"No, ma'am!"
Spitfire,[to Bulk Biceps] Ya think you're hot stuff? [to Rainbow Dash] You look like you're the worst flyer in the whole academy! You'll probably quit after the first day!
Rainbow Dash,"No, ma'am! I'd never quit, ma'am!"
Spitfire,Ha. What about you? Bet you couldn't fly past the first flagpole without getting winded.
Lightning Dust,"Try me, ma'am."
Spitfire,What's that?
Lightning Dust,"Let me show you what I've got, ma'am."
Spitfire,"Ah. You want a chance to prove yourself, huh?"
Lightning Dust,"Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire,"Well then, now's your chance. Give me five hundred laps! All of you!"
Spitfire,Lap four-hundred and ninety-nine!
Rainbow Dash,One more lap to go!
Lightning Dust,You're on!
Spitfire,Five hundred!
Spitfire,Not bad... for a couple of newbies.
Lightning Dust,Name's Lightning Dust.
Rainbow Dash,Rainbow Dash!
Lightning Dust,Wanna grab some grub in the mess hall?
Rainbow Dash,Definitely.
Applejack,"Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash hasn't even been gone twenty-four hours yet. Give her a chance to settle in first. Why don't we just go see what Twilight's up to? I hear Princess Celestia's got her workin' on some new spells!"
Applejack,"So in other words, you're stickin' by the mailbox."
Pinkie Pie,Yep!
Applejack,Suit yourself.
Spitfire,"The Wonderbolts are the fastest, best precision flyers in the world. But spin-outs can still happen. And when they do, a Wonderbolt must be able to recover quickly. This... is the Dizzitron. It's gonna make you very <U+0096> I repeat <U+0096> very dizzy. Your task is to try and recover and fly straight again, as soon as possible. Once you have recovered you must come in for a smooth landing. Now, who's first? [to Meadow Flower] You. You're up."
Spitfire,Now! Ready?
Meadow Flower,"Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire,Go!
Spitfire,Release!
Spitfire,"Huh. Fifteen seconds. Decent, but I wouldn't go writin' home about it! Who's next? Alright, Rainbow Dash. Let's see what you got."
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire,"Okay, go!"
Spitfire,Release! Six seconds? That's an academy record.
Meadow Flower,You made it look so easy.
Rainbow Dash,I make everything look easy.
Spitfire,"Okay, Lightning Dust. You're up."
Lightning Dust,"Ma'am, can you put the Dizzitron at maximum speed? I wanna push my limits."
Spitfire,You sure about that?
Lightning Dust,Yes ma'am.
Spitfire,Okay. You asked for it.
Spitfire,Release! Six point five seconds. Not bad.
Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust,Heh!/Oh yeah!
Spitfire,Next!
Rainbow Dash,No pony even came close to six seconds.
Lightning Dust,They should make us Wonderbolts right now.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, they should."
Spitfire,"Listen up! For the rest of the camp, you'll be working in pairs. 'Morrow morning, I'll post the teams, including who'll be lead pony and who'll be wingpony. Good luck."
Lightning Dust,Like we're going to need it.
Rainbow Dash,"Heh, yeah."
Rainbow Dash,"So, which one of you lucky gals gets to be my wingpony? What?"
Cloudchaser,"Eh, you might want to check the wall."
Rainbow Dash,A wingpony?
Lightning Dust,They made us a team! Isn't that awesome?
Rainbow Dash,"Permission to enter, ma'am."
Spitfire,"What is it, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,I had the best time on the Dizzitron! Only six seconds!
Spitfire,And?
Rainbow Dash,And you made me a wingpony!
Spitfire,Because I believe you and Lightning Dust will be an unstoppable team. Do you not think you'll be an unstoppable team?
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, ma'am! I mean no, ma'am! I mean... We'll be an unstoppable team, ma'am."
Spitfire,Then what's the problem?
Rainbow Dash,"I think I should be lead pony, ma'am."
Spitfire,And I think Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony. Got it?
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, ma'am."
Spitfire,Good.
Spitfire,"Today you will all be participating in a flag hunt. We'll divide you into two teams, red... and blue. Whoever finds the most flags of the opposing team's color wins."
Meadow Flower,"Oh, this is gonna be so much fun!"
Spitfire,"If you think this is gonna to be fun, you are sadly mistaken. This is for training purposes. This is not recess. Lead ponies and wingponies must fly together. If any pair splits apart, they will be immediately disqualified. Do you understand?"
All Pegasi,"Yes, ma'am!"
Lightning Dust,Ready to rock and roll?
Rainbow Dash,Ready.
Lightning Dust,You spotted any flags yet?
Rainbow Dash,Not yet. Oh! There's one!
Lightning Dust,Good eyes!
Rainbow Dash,We should slow down. It doesn't look like both of us can make it at this speed!
Lightning Dust,Peh.
Rainbow Dash,Ow!
Spitfire,Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash found the first flag!
Lightning Dust,Come on! Let's find some more!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, sure. Just give me a second."
Lightning Dust,"Oh, you're fine."
Rarity,She's still at it.
Fluttershy,I just wish we could help her.
Pinkie Pie,"Help me? The only thing that could possibly help me right now is a letter from Rainbow Dash! It's been three days already. By now, she probably doesn't even know our names anymore! She probably can't remember our faces! ""Pinkie Pie? I never heard of a Pinkie Pie! Who is Pinkie Pie?"""
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, if you're so worried, then why don't you send her a letter first?"
Pinkie Pie,Of course! That's a great idea!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh wait! I got an even better idea! How about we send Rainbow Dash a care package? You know, before she forgets all about us? Although, come on, let's face it. It's probably too late for that. But, uh, maybe it'll jog her memory somehow."
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, I'm sure Rainbow Dash still remembers our faces and who we are. But I think sending her a care package is a great idea."
Pinkie Pie,A care package it is! We'll send it through the mail! WAIT! Ah! That won't work at all!
Applejack,Why not?
Pinkie Pie,Because what if the package gets lost in the mail? What if somepony else gets the package by accident and then she remembers us instead of Rainbow Dash and then she becomes our new friend? And then the real Rainbow Dash won't ever know that she used to have friends and she forgot them!
Applejack,Is anypony else followin' this?
Others,"Fluttershy, Twilight, Mmm-mm."
Pinkie Pie,I've got it! We'll deliver the care package to Rainbow Dash in person!
Rarity,I wouldn't mind a little trip.
Twilight Sparkle,I'll go!
Applejack,Count me in!
Fluttershy,Me too.
Pinkie Pie,Me five! But don't be upset if she doesn't recognize you at first. It may take a while for her to get her memory back.
Spitfire,Today we'll be doing our famous air obstacle course.
Lightning Dust,"Ugh! Can't they go any faster? It's no good, I can't get around them!"
Rainbow Dash,Doesn't matter! We can still fly completely in sync and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves!
Lightning Dust,I guess...
Lightning Dust,"What are they, a couple of snails? It's just a little weather."
Lightning Dust,Now's our chance to pass these slowpokes!
Spitfire,"Not bad! And in record time, too! Definitely made the right decision making you two a team. The others seem to have had a little trouble with the precision part of the exercise. I'd better go help sort them out. Why don't you two go hit the mess hall early?"
Lightning Dust,"Yes, ma'am!"
Rainbow Dash,"Thank you, ma'am. Um, Lightning Dust? Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that."
Lightning Dust,"Hey, you snooze, you lose! Besides, Wonderbolts are supposed to be able to recover from a spin-out. You saw them on the Dizzitron! They could use the practice. I mean, it's not our fault we're so much better than those other guys! Not every pony is destined to become a Wonderbolt. Only the best of the best, right?"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I-I guess you're right..."
Lightning Dust,'Course I'm right! Now let's go fuel up! Kicking all that tail has made me hungry.
Bulk Biceps,[chomp] Yeah!
Lightning Dust,I have an idea about how we can literally blow away our competition.
Rainbow Dash,But we're already way ahead.
Lightning Dust,Are you in or not?
Spitfire,[echoing] Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony.
Rainbow Dash,I'm in!
Lightning Dust,Then follow my lead!
Lightning Dust,I can't control it!
Applejack,It's a twister!
Twilight Sparkle,Hold on!
Rainbow Dash,Noooooo!
Rest of main cast,[screaming] Huh?
Rainbow Dash,Are you guys okay?
Others,"Rarity, Twilight, Uh-huh."
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie,You... remember me!
Rainbow Dash,"Well... yeah, of course I remember you. But... what are you all doing here?"
Applejack,We wanted to bring you a care package. Didn't realize you'd be in the middle of some crazy tornado drill.
Lightning Dust,That... was... awesome!
Rainbow Dash,Awesome? My friends could have been smashed to pieces!
Lightning Dust,"Yeah, but they weren't, right? Can't say the same for the clouds. We totally wiped them out with that tornado. The other cadets will have to be up there for days to bust as many as we did."
Rainbow Dash,A hoof bump? Seriously? You made me clip my wing. You sent half of our class into serious tailspins on the obstacle course. You unleashed a tornado that nearly demolished my friends!
Lightning Dust,"Yeah, and?"
Rainbow Dash,And I get that you want to be the best. So do I! But you're going about it in the wrong way.
Lightning Dust,"The Wonderbolts don't seem to think so. After all, Spitfire did make me the leader and you the wingpony."
Rainbow Dash,[sigh] You're right. She did.
Spitfire,This better be important. You're supposed to be up there busting clouds with your partner.
Rainbow Dash,"We're done with that, ma'am."
Spitfire,Already? That's an academy record! Explain your methods.
Rainbow Dash,"That's why I'm here, ma'am. Lightning Dust decided to use a tornado."
Spitfire,"A bit excessive for cloud-busting. But judging from your time, it was obviously an effective tactic."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, well that ""effective tactic"" nearly took out my friends! No disrespect, ma'am, but there's a big difference between pushing yourself as hard as you can and just being reckless. And if being reckless is what gets rewarded around here, if that's what it means to be a Wonderbolt, then I don't want any part of it."
Spitfire,"What are you saying, newbie?"
Rainbow Dash,I quit.
Applejack,You did what?!
Rarity,Being a Wonderbolt was your dream!
Rainbow Dash,Not anymore.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I know how much this meant to you."
Spitfire,"Rainbow Dash! How dare you storm out of my office without giving me a chance to respond! The Wonderbolts are looking for the best flyers in Equestria, but you were right. Being the best should never come at the expense of our fellow ponies. It's not just about pushing ourselves. It's about pushing ourselves in the right direction. You've shown that you're capable of doing just that. You're no wingpony, Rainbow Dash. You're a leader."
Rainbow Dash,OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!
Spitfire,Now get out there and give me twenty!
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, ma'am!"
Pinkie Pie,Wait! You didn't even get to open your care package!
Applejack,Ha! Found 'em!
Granny Smith,Aaa-choooo!
Applejack,Heh. Gesundhoof.
Granny Smith,"Why, thank you, Applejack. I still can't believe it's been almost one hundred moons since our last family reunion. Aw, I remember it like it was yesterday."
Applejack,"Well, you have been talkin' about it pretty much every day since then."
Granny Smith,Apple Bloom! How them RSVPs comin' along? Who's showin' their muzzle at the reunion?
Apple Bloom,Everypony!
Granny Smith,"Everypony? [aside, to Applejack] Feathers on a goat. [to Apple Bloom] Are you sure?"
Apple Bloom,"Well, I got RSVPs from Apples from Yonder Hill, Hollow Shades, Galloping Gorge, Foal Mountain, Apples from Fillydelphia, Tall Tale Town, and all the Apples from Appleloosa!"
Granny Smith,Guh?
Apple Bloom,Oh! And how could I forget? Manehattan! Babs is comin'! I get to see my favorite cousin!
Granny Smith,I think we're gonna need a bigger cider trough.
Granny Smith,Whooeee! Looks like the family's grown tenfold since the last reunion! I'm gonna be busier than a worm in a rotten tomater tryin' to get everything ready!
Applejack,I could always help out.
Apple Bloom,"Me, too!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Granny Smith,"Oh, I sure would appreciate that. Granny's a little rustier in the giddy-up since the last time the Apples all got together."
Applejack,"You may be a tad old, Granny, but you're as feisty and full of spark as ever<U+0096>"
Granny Smith,Who you callin' old?!
Applejack,Uh... I just meant... Why don't you let me take over puttin' the reunion together this time 'round? Then all you need to worry about is enjoyin' yourself.
Granny Smith,"Hmmm. Alright, young'un, you got yourself a deal. You are in charge."
Applejack,"I won't let you down, Granny. You just tell me what the reunion needs, and I'll take care of the rest."
Granny Smith,I'll do better than tell you what the reunion'll need. I'll show ya!
Granny Smith,We've been hostin' these things at Sweet Apple Acres every hundred moons since we first planted roots here in Ponyville.
Apple Bloom,"Hey, who's that?"
Granny Smith,"That'd be your Great-Great-Auntie Applesauce when she was just about your age. Now, she used to go by another name, but everypony started calling her Applesauce after half her teeth fell out when she was makin' apple jam. Yeah. Never did find them teeth in all those jars."
Apple Bloom,"Hey! That's you, Granny!"
Granny Smith,Sure is. Apple family's been workin' on that same old quilt since our first reunion.
Young Granny Smith,"I can do it! Ngh! Oh, fingle-fangle!"
Granny Smith,"Well, nopony told me you actually had to knot the end of the thread!"
Applejack,"Okay, so I'll need to get new quiltin' materials, fabric, needles, thread... You've really been workin' on the same quilt since the first reunion?"
Granny Smith,Surely have. I don't think we're ever gonna finish that doggone thing!
Apple Bloom,"Hey, what's goin' on here?"
Granny Smith,"Well, you know us Apples enjoy a good fritter..."
Half Baked Apple,"[licking lips] [munches]<U+00A0>Ooo, hot hot hot!"
Apple Split,"Hey, where did all them apple fritters go?"
Apple Split,And...
Apple Split,"Who are you, little one?"
Baby Applejack,I'm Applejack! More apple fwitter?
Granny Smith,That's how we figured out your sister had the appetite of a full-grown stallion.
Applejack,"Better get twice as much honey and flour, then... fifty more buckets of apples... more oil... wood for the fire..."
Granny Smith,"Now, stick an apple in my mouth and roast my rump! This one sure brings back memories. Y'know how Babs is your favorite cousin? Well, Apple Rose is mine. The two of us entered the seven-legged race every reunion!"
Young Apple Rose,"We're gonna win this one, cousin!"
Young Granny Smith,"You bet your hot-diggety-derriere we are! C'mon, cousin, speed'er on up!"
Granny Smith,Never won a single one of them races.
Applejack,"Races. We'll need cloth ties, finish line... Not much to a seven-legged race. Hmm..."
Granny Smith,"And, of course, we can't forget to take the big family photo! We always snapped a photo in front of the barn at the end of every reunion, let's us see how our family's grown!"
Applejack,Photo in front of the barn. Got it.
Apple Bloom,"You sure have some great memories of these reunions, don'tcha?"
Granny Smith,"Indeedy, and I'm lookin' forward to makin' more at this one. Oh, I'm sure everypony is, and I do mean everypony! We got the whole family together this time 'round! Who knows if they'll all be able to make the next one?"
Applejack,"That's true! Busy as everypony's lives are gettin' these days, chances are pretty slim we'll be this lucky next time 'round. Don't worry, Granny, I'm gonna make sure this is the most memorable reunion we've ever had! I'd better get started... I've got some plannin' to do!"
Granny Smith,"Oh, hootenanny! Would you look what your second cousin is wearin' on her head?"
Applejack,Apple Bloom! What are you doin' up?
Apple Bloom,I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Applejack,I can't sleep. My gears are turnin' in my head about this reunion!
Apple Bloom,[yawning] Yeah... I can't wait to see my cousin Babs. We're gonna do so many fun things together...
Applejack,"Fun? That's just the beginnin' of it! Granny Smith handed me the reins of this reunion, and I'm gonna make the most of it. Apple Bloom, I've got so many things planned you won't even have a minute's rest!"
Applejack,"Trust me, little sis. This reunion I'm puttin' together is gonna be worth the wait."
Apple Bloom,[snoring] Whoa!
Applejack,Rise and shine! We don't have much time!
Pinkie Pie,[belches] Don't forget the glitter!
Applejack,H-ah. Think that'll do it!
Granny Smith,"And just in time, too."
Applejack,They're here!
Granny Smith,"Apple Rose! Ohhh! Ooh, this is more excitin' than when it rained frogs!"
Applejack,"[through megaphone] Howdy, y'all, and welcome to the Apple family reunion!"
Applejack,"[through megaphone] My name's Applejack, and I just want to let y'all know that I got a real big day planned for ya! We're gonna start off with an obstacle course for the young'uns, and some fritter makin' and quiltin' for the not-so-young'uns. And there's lots more to come after that! Hope y'all enjoy it!"
Apple Bloom,Where is she?
Apple Bloom,Babs!
Babs Seed,Cuz!
Apple Bloom,"I know it hasn't been that long since we've seen each other, but<U+0096>"
Apple Bloom and Babs Seed,<U+0096>It felt like forever!
Babs Seed,I can't wait to tell you about my new school!
Apple Bloom,I can't wait to hear all about it!
Babs Seed,"Jeepers, where do I start? Okay. So first day<U+0096>"
Applejack,"Babs! Huh, so glad you could come!"
Applejack,Why don't you two head over to the obstacle course?
Apple Bloom,We kinda wanna catch up a little bit first...
Applejack,Don't you worry. There'll be plenty of time for family bondin' while you're racin' against your other cousins.
Applejack,"Alrighty, ponies! Ready to have some fun?"
Babs Seed,"Whoa, is that the finish line? It's like a mile away or somethin'!"
Applejack,"Actually, that's just the marker where you go on to the next leg of the race."
Apple Bloom,There's more?
Applejack,"Much more. Trust me, I have put together somethin' you are never gonna forget. After the seven-legged race, you're gonna wanna hurry up and head over here, where you'll be bobbin' for apples!"
Applejack,"Then you'll run around these trees fifty times until you're real good and dizzy. Then you'll jump these big wooden hurdles. And then there's the final leg, where you'll balance plates on your head while sayin' ""Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets"" over and over and over again. Last pony standin' wins!"
Apple Bloom,Seriously?
Applejack,"Seriously! C'mon, y'all! Let's start makin' some memories! On your mark... get set... go!"
Applejack,"Whooeee! Lookin' good, everypony! Ooh, better go check on the quilt."
Granny Smith,"How long you had those new choppers, Auntie Applesauce?"
Auntie Applesauce,A lady never reveals the age of her teeth.
Apple Rose,Ugh.
Auntie Applesauce,"Don't you roll your eyes at me, Miss Apple Rose! I imagine you two think I have forgotten what you did to my parasol six reunions ago?"
Granny Smith,[giggles] We were just usin' it to help break open that pi<f1>ata!
Auntie Applesauce,"Applejack, delightful to see you. Are you gonna join us in some quiltin'?"
Applejack,"Sorry, Auntie Applesauce, I am busy-busy-busy. Y'all should get started, though!"
Granny Smith,We couldn't find our rocking chairs.
Applejack,I got rid of 'em to make room for these. This is the year y'all are finally gonna finish that quilt!
Apple Rose,Finish it?
Applejack,[over noise] Won't that be excitin'?
Apple Rose,[over noise] What's that?
Applejack,"[over noise] I said, won't that be<U+0096>"
Applejack,<U+0096>excitin'?
Auntie Applesauce,"I suppose, although I have been told that too much excitement can wreak havoc on this youthful complexion of mine."
Apple Rose,Oh.
Applejack,[over noise] That's the spirit!
Granny Smith,[over noise] What did she say?
Apple Rose,[over noise] What?
Granny Smith,[over noise] Good gracious!
Apple Rose,[over noise] Golden Delicious? I think he's racing with his cousin!
Babs Seed,[dizzy] How are Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle?
Apple Bloom,[dizzy] Great! Ugh...
Babs Seed,[dizzy] You alright?
Apple Bloom,Ugh...
Apple Dumpling,"You've got eight now, dont'cha?"
Apple Leaves,"Oh, sure do. Tell you what, my Apple Tart may just be a baby, but he is a hoot!"
Applejack,Havin' fun?
Apple Leaves,Sure are!
Applejack,"Better pick up the pace on those fritters though, huh? Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Now you try! That's it! Gotta keep this assembly line movin', gals! We want every Apple here to get a chance to taste the best darn fritters in Equestria!"
Apple Bloom and Babs Seed,Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets.
Apple Bloom,Any other blank flanks at your new school?
Babs Seed,Yeah. Two.
Apple Bloom and Babs Seed,Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets.
Apple Bloom,Do they wanna be Crusaders?
Babs Seed,Totally!
Apple Bloom,Great!
Apple Bloom and Babs Seed,Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets.
Babs Seed,Ah can' thfeel my tongue.
Apple Bloom,Neh nehber.
Applejack,"[through megaphone] Alright, Apples, break!"
Apple Bloom,[sighs] Finally...
Applejack,"Ooh, can't forget to capture all these memories for Granny's album! Huh. Nothin' all that memorable there. Or there. Or there. C'mon, Applejack, think. You gotta kick this thing up a notch! Hm..."
Apple Bloom,"I get that my big sis wants this to be like a super-awesome reunion, but that was ridiculous!"
Babs Seed,I thought we'd never get a minute to just hang out!
Applejack,And your minute's up! Your fellow Apples are waitin' for you to join them.
Apple Bloom,"Applejack, I haven't had any time with Babs! We were so busy with that obstacle course, we didn't even get to talk!"
Applejack,There'll be plenty of time to bond with Babs when we do the hayride.
Babs Seed,Hayride?
Applejack,"Alright, everypony! Step right up, take a seat, and leave the drivin' to these stallions! Now, I know y'all've been workin' real hard makin' some awesome memories. And in all of our past reunions, we always had a nice and relaxin' hayride around the farm. Which is why I decided to change things up a bit, and try somethin' just a wee bit more excitin'. So let's get this show on the road! Giddy-up!"
Ponies,Whoa!
Auntie Applesauce,[teethless] I just had those professionally polished.
Granny Smith,Where in the world does that girl have us headed? The west orchard?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Babs Seed,Wowza! Never seen real fruit bats before!
Applejack,Uh-oh.
Apple Bloom,Everypony! Jump out!!
Applejack,[crying] Ruined. Everythin' is ruined.
Applejack,"Oh, Granny. I'm so, so sorry."
Granny Smith,"Oh, it's alright, child."
Applejack,But it's not alright. Just look at this! The barn and all my plans for the perfect family reunion are completely destroyed!
Apple Bloom,Maybe that's a good thing.
Applejack,How can that possibly be a good thing?
Granny Smith,"Applejack, you had us so caught up in all the doin', we haven't had a second to enjoy the company of the folks we've been doin' it with!"
Applejack,Really?
Applejack,"[sighs] Oh, Granny Smith, here you let me be in charge of creatin' great memories, and the only thing anypony's gonna remember about this reunion... is that it was the worst one we ever had."
Granny Smith,"Oh, hey now... everypony's still here, ain't they? Still plenty of time to make good memories! You've just got to give everypony a chance to actually make 'em."
Applejack,The family photo! Guess we can't take it in front of the barn this year... unless... Everypony! I have one more activity!
Granny Smith,Applejack...
Applejack,"Trust me, Granny Smith. This'll be one we'll remember for all the right reasons."
Applejack,Yee-hoo!
Others,"Raise this barn, raise this barn One, two, three, four Together, we can raise this barn One, two, three, four"
Others,"Up, up, up, go the beams Hammer those joints, work in teams Turn 'em round quick by the right elbow Grab a new partner, here we go"
Apple family,Yeah!
Applejack,"Come on, Apple family! Let's get to it! Wee-hoo!"
Applejack,"Raise this barn, raise this barn One, two, three, four Together, we can raise this barn One, two, three, four"
Others,"Finish the frame, recycling wood Workin' hard, you're doin' good Turn 'em round quick by the right elbow Grab a new partner, here we go"
Apple family,Yeah!
Applejack,Whoo-whee!
Applejack,"Raise this barn, oh, raise this barn One, two, three, four Together, we can raise this barn One, two, three, four"
Others,"Slats of wood come off the ground Hold 'em up and nail 'em down Turn 'em round quick by the left elbow Grab a new partner, here we go"
Apple family,Yeah!
Applejack,"Come on, Apples! Get 'er done!"
Apple Bloom,"Look at us, we're family"
Applejack,Workin' together thankfully
Apple Bloom,"We Apples, we are proud to say"
Applejack and Apple Bloom,Stick together the pony way
Applejack,"Bow to your partner, circle right Get down if you're scared of heights Forward back and twirl around That barn's gonna be the best in town"
Apple family,Yeah!
Applejack,Yee-haw! Attagirl!
Apple Bloom,"Alright, let's get to it!"
Apple family,"Raise this barn, raise this barn One, two, three, four Together, we can raise this barn One, two, three, four"
Applejack,"Take your brushes, young and old Together, paint it, bright and bold Turn 'em round quick by the left elbow Grab a new partner, here we go"
Apple family,"We raised this barn, we raised this barn Yes, we did Together we sure raised this barn Yes, we did"
Others,Being together counts the most We all came here from coast to coast All we need to strive to be Is part of the Apple family
Apple Bloom,Yeah!
Granny Smith,Oh!
Apple Bloom,I can't wait for the next reunion!
Babs Seed,Me neither!
Apple Bloom,"I mean, obviously we have to get together before then!"
Babs Seed,[chuckles] Obviously.
Granny Smith,"Oh, you did it, Applejack! You put on a reunion that everypony will remember!"
Applejack,Just had a couple minor hiccups along the way.
Granny Smith,"Yeah, just a couple."
Granny Smith,"Ohohoh, that's a good one."
Apple Bloom,Oh!
Applejack,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Applejack,"Today I learned a great lesson about family, which, if you think about it, is really the first group of friends you ever make. Turns out that when you're with folks you care about, you don't have to do much to make that time memorable. Even the simplest of activities can take on a whole lotta meanin'! And you'll find that you'll remember the ""who"" long after you've forgotten the ""what""."
Others,"Your humble subject,"
Others,Applejack
Spike,"Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve."
Twilight Sparkle,Huh. That's not that many.
Spike,Are you kidding? How are you supposed to read twelve books in one weekend?
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Celestia obviously thinks I can or she would never have assigned them to me. I'm not planning on letting her down.
Spike,"Well, I hope you're not planning on sleeping then, either."
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, Spike, why don't you take the day off?"
Spike,Really?
Twilight Sparkle,Why not? These books are gonna keep me busy for a while.
Spike,Hmm... I do have a long list of things I've been dying to do!
Spike,"""Touch nose with tongue."" Eeeng... done! ""Play bongos on my belly."""
Spike,"Done! ""Smell my dirty feet."" [sniffs] [sigh] Done! Huh, that didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would."
Spike,"What to do, what to do..."
Spike,[gasps] A hot air balloon ride!
Spike,[gasps] Oh no! Wait! Runaway balloon! Gah!
Spike,[groans] Sorry!
Spike,"[relieved sigh] That was a close one. I-if I didn't know better, I would swear that I was in the middle of the dark and scary Everfree Forest."
Applejack,"Come 'n' get me, ya big goons! [to Spike] Run!"
Spike,I'm running! I'm running!
Applejack,Whew!
Spike,"Wow, Applejack! That was amazing! I mean, you rocketed those boulders at them like they were... rockets! Pow, pow, pow pow pow! You saved my life! [softly] You... saved... my life."
Applejack,"Aw, don't mention it, Spike. C'mon, we should be headin' on back, now."
Spike,"Man, am I lucky you were out here. Uh, why were you out here?"
Applejack,"Saw the balloon floatin' by with nopony in it, came out here to investigate. Guess you did too, huh?"
Spike,"Uh... yeah... I was investigating the runaway hot air balloon too! So, uh, now that the mystery's been solved, let's get outta here, huh?"
Applejack,"Thanks for walkin' me home, Spike. That was mighty kind of you. But now I have chores that need tendin' to, so see you later."
Spike,What chores? I'll do them!
Applejack,"That's sweet, but you don't have<U+0096>"
Spike,It's the least I can do! You saved my life! I need to repay the favor.
Applejack,"Shoot, Spike, that's what friends do for each other. You don't need to repay the favor."
Spike,"Yes, I do!"
Applejack,"Sugar, it's okay, it's not necessary."
Spike,"Applejack, you don't understand! This is something I really need to do!"
Applejack,"Well, I'd hate to get in the way of doin' somethin' you need to do..."
Spike,Great! What should I do?
Applejack,"Uh... Apple Bloom's over yonder givin' little Piggington a bath. I was gonna lend her a hoof, but maybe you could lend her one instead."
Spike,On the double!
Spike,Applejack said I could help you!
Apple Bloom,Great! I could use all the help I can get!
Spike,"Heh, wait 'til Applejack sees how you sparkle!"
Spike,Ta-da!
Applejack,"Good job, you two."
Apple Bloom,"Applejack, is it okay if I get goin'? I don't wanna be late for my Crusaders meeting. We're gettin' fitted for water skis!"
Applejack,"Heh, you definitely don't wanna be late for that."
Apple Bloom,"Water skiin' cutie mark, here I come!"
Applejack,"Spike, you can head on out too. I reckon you have repaid me in full so we are officially even Steven."
Spike,"What? Ohhh no. We aren't even close to being even Steven! Please, Applejack, you must allow me to assist you further!"
Applejack,"I dunno, Spike. Just don't feel right to have you, uh, doin' things for me."
Spike,Please?
Applejack,"Really, you don't<U+0096>"
Spike,Pretty please?
Applejack,It's just not necessary<U+0096>
Spike,Pretty pretty pretty please?
Applejack,"[sigh] Oh, all right. You can help Granny Smith and me bake some<U+0096>"
Spike,Pies! Pies! I'm helping Applejack make some pies!
Granny Smith,"Uh, Spike, little feller, could you get us some more eggs?"
Spike,"Uh, oops, sorry, Applejack. Lemme get something to clean that up!"
Applejack,"[sighs] Appreciate all your help today, sugarcube, but... I can take it from here."
Spike,Don't be ridiculous! It is my honor and my duty! Today's just the beginning!
Applejack,What's that now?
Spike,"You saved my life! [belches] According to the ""Spike the Dragon Code"", I owe you a life debt and must serve you."
Granny Smith,"Now, what about Twilight? Doesn't she need your help and such?"
Spike,"[breathes fire] Huh, you're right. I better break the news to Twilight. I just hope she doesn't take it too hard... Be right back!"
Spike,"Come on, Spike, this is your personal, moral, ethical dragon code we're talking about! You have to do this! It's not like you and Twilight won't be friends anymore... but it won't be the same... but it has to be done. Twilight, Applejack just saved my life from horrible, dragon-eating timberwolves!"
Twilight Sparkle,Mm-hmm...
Spike,"And, as you are aware, I adhere to my dragon code, and this means I must serve her for the rest of my natural born days! I'm sure you understand."
Twilight Sparkle,Mm-hmm...
Spike,It's... been an honor... being your faithful assistant.
Twilight Sparkle,Sounds good.
Spike,She said it was okay.
Applejack and Granny Smith,Really?
Spike,"So, with Twilight's blessing, I'm free to follow my code and serve you until<U+0096>"
Spike,"Well, until forever!"
Applejack,"Listen, sugarcube, I completely respect your ""dragon code""... Truly I do, but I just can't cotton with you permanently servin' me."
Spike,"Please, Applejack, my dragon code is a part of me! I have to be true to myself! If you don't let me do this, I won't be a noble dragon anymore!"
Applejack,"Oh, well, I can't have you feelin' like you're not a noble dragon now, can I?"
Spike,"Great! Then from here on in, your wish is my command."
Applejack,"Oh, uh, okay... I would like you to... hmm... huh... oh! ...Help me take some of the pie you made to..."
Spike,Rarity?
Applejack,"Uh, sure, why not?"
Spike,I helped bake it.
Rarity,Eugh.
Spike,You even look good when you're chewing... [laughs nervously] W-who looks good when they're chewing?
Spike,Aren't you gonna have some more?
Rarity,I... had a big lunch!
Spike,It's ten in the morning.
Rarity,Breakfast. A big breakfast.
Spike,Ohhh. Okay.
Applejack,Maybe you could take her plate back to the kitchen and wash it off?
Spike,As you wish!
Rarity,What was that all about?
Applejack,"[sighs] I saved Spike from some timberwolves in the Everfree Forest, and now he thinks he has to serve me forever."
Rarity,"[delighted squeal] Oh, what I wouldn't give to have somepony forever in my debt! I'd get them to organize my closets, and give me pedicures, and help me with my sewing and<U+0096>"
Applejack,"Okay, I get it, havin' somepony to do things for you would be a dream come true. But I don't feel right havin' Spike thinkin' he owes me somethin'. You tasted that pie. Sometimes, his help isn't that helpful."
Spike,Do you... have a broom I could borrow?
Rainbow Dash,"AJ, Rarity, what's happening?"
Rarity,Applejack saved Spike's life and now he has to serve her forever.
Rainbow Dash,Sweet! What are you having him do? Wash your laundry? Clean your room? Help you with your unfinished novel? Mine's about this awesome Pegasus who's the best flyer ever and becomes the captain of the Wonderbolts!
Rarity,[sarcastic] How ever did you come up with that ingeniously woven intricate plot line?
Rainbow Dash,Just came to me.
Applejack,"Thing is, I don't really want him to serve me forever, but I don't know how to get him to stop."
Rainbow Dash,"That's easy! Just make him help you with something really, really hard."
Applejack,I dunno. I don't want him to get hurt.
Rainbow Dash,Puh-lease. He'll quit way before there's even a chance of getting hurt!
Rainbow Dash,"[hushed, to Applejack] Leave this to me. [to Spike] Sooo, Spike, Applejack was gonna help me stack some hay so I could practice smashing through it, but I'm feeling extra, extra powerful today."
Applejack,You are?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I am. So instead of hay, I'm gonna smash through rocks!"
Spike,Rocks?
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! A huge tower of rocks! And you're gonna build it!
Spike,I am?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I mean, unless you don't wanna help Applejack..."
Spike,I do! It is Spike's dragon code!
Rainbow Dash,Then get to it! [to Applejack] Trust me. This is gonna work like a charm!
Rainbow Dash,"Huh. I was sure he'd give up after, like, three rocks."
Fluttershy,"Oh, goodness. If it'd been me, I'd have just pretended I didn't have anything for him to do."
Applejack,Why didn't I think of that?
Spike,[yelling] Is this high enough?
Applejack,"That's plenty high! Come on down, Spike!"
Rainbow Dash,Bad news: He actually ended up building the whole rock tower. Good news... [nervously] I've got a rock tower to knock down.
Spike,"Haha, yeah! You can do it! Haha, hahah, alright, yeah!"
Spike,That... was... awesome!
Spike,"Wanna do it again, Rainbow Dash? Applejack can rebuild it for you. And when I say ""Applejack"", I of course mean me!"
Rainbow Dash,[dazed] Sure! Why not...?
Applejack,"No! I mean, I don't think Rainbow Dash needs any more of your help. My help. She doesn't need it. Right, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,Bbbbrrr. Yeah. I guess I'm good. For now.
Applejack,"And so am I! I just can't think of one more thing I need help with, so you don't have to do anything else."
Spike,W-What do you mean you can't think of anything else I can help with?
Applejack,Exactly that! There's nothin' else. I don't want you to do anything.
Spike,"If I don't help you, how will I know I'm a noble dragon?"
Applejack,"Well, I<U+0096>"
Spike,"Maybe there's things you need help with, but you don't even realize you need help with!"
Fluttershy,"If she needed help, I think she'd realize it."
Spike,Maybe not! Maybe Applejack needs help realizing what she needs help with. Like... maybe your back itches!
Applejack,Huuuuh... that does feel... good...
Spike,"[laughs] See? Or you might need help remembering your favorite song! ""The dragon is the finest creature ever, there's more to him than just guarding treasure..."""
Fluttershy,I don't think that's her favorite s<U+0096>
Spike,Or... you might need help breathing!
Applejack,Breathin'? I certainly do not<U+0096>
Spike,"See? There are plenty of things I can help you with, and you don't even have to trouble yourself with thinking of them!"
Applejack,"No, I'll think of 'em. Lemme think of 'em."
Spike,As you wish.
Applejack,"Twilight? Twilight, are you there? Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,Agh!
Applejack,"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] No, it's okay, I need to take a break anyway. What's going on?"
Applejack,"I know Spike told you that he was gonna follow his dragon code, and serve me forever for savin' him from the timberwolves, and that you were okay with it, but<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait, what?"
Applejack,He said he told you all about it. I'm guessin' maybe you were a little distracted when he told you.
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, maybe a little..."
Applejack,"I should've realized you wouldn't have let him go so easily. Well, now that you know what's goin' on, maybe you could talk some sense into him!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Applejack, I wish I could, but this is dragon code we're talking about. Surely you know how important the dragon code is to a dragon!"
Applejack,I sure am startin' to.
Twilight Sparkle,"Hm, there's only one other way Spike is gonna fulfill the debt he feels he owes you."
Spike,"Seventy, seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five..."
Applejack,"All right, y'all, here's the deal. Spike needs to save my life."
Pinkie Pie,And you want us to shoot you out of a cannon towards a hornet's nest and give Spike a butterfly net so he can catch you mere seconds before you hit the nest and are stung by a thousand angry hornets! I'll wear this mustache.
Applejack,No. I am gonna be attacked by a timberwolf!
Pinkie Pie,Can I still wear the mustache?
Applejack,"When I give the signal, Pinkie Pie and Rarity will come runnin' out of the woods, bein' pursued by the timberwolf. I'll start to run too, but then pretend to get my hoof stuck. I'll ask Spike to help me dislodge it, and he will, and I'll be able to get away from the terrifyin' timberwolf! Havin' saved me from certain doom, Spike will then consider us even. Everybody get it?"
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,Uh-huh.
Twilight Sparkle,I'll do my best.
Rarity,Mm-hmm.
Pinkie Pie,Just one question.
Applejack,Yes? [beat] No.
Pinkie Pie,[sighs] Suit yourself.
Rarity,"[clears throat] We are all ready to play our parts, ahem, but are you sure you are ready to play yours, Applejack?"
Applejack,What d'you mean?
Rarity,"Show us your best ""damsel in distress"" move."
Applejack,"Uh... Oh, well, aheh, how's this? Hooooooo."
Rarity,"Absolutely horrendous! Okay, this needs some serious work! Now, first, you must lift your foreleg up to your forehead, like so<U+0096>"
Spike,[in distance] Applejack?
Applejack,"No time! Here he comes! Uh... over here, Spike!"
Spike,[pants] You said you had something else you needed me to do?
Applejack,"Oh, yes, I, I was just hopin' you could maybe, uh, sweep up all those leaves for a compost pile, and<U+0096>"
Spike,"But of course. Oh, by the way, there are exactly twenty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and thirty seven blades of grass at Sweet Apple Acres."
Applejack,I can't believe you counted every single one of 'em...
Spike,You asked me to.
Spike,"And, as a noble dragon and follower of my dragon code, I<U+0096>"
Fluttershy,That was very convincing!
Rarity,[screaming] Timberwolf! [sobbing] We are doomed!
Rarity,[to Applejack] See? Like that.
Applejack,"[unconvincingly] Oh no! I seem to have got my hoof caught in between two rocks! I cannot run away! I am a damsel in distress! Help me, Spike!"
Spike,Wait a minute.
Applejack,"No, no, don't wait a minute. Save me from the terrifyin' timberwolf!"
Spike,"Well, he would be terrifying if he wasn't a fake! You got the clomping on his claws..."
Spike,"...The roar was spot on, and the detail on his face is pretty good. But you forgot one thing: his breath! You could smell a real timberwolf's breath from a mile<U+0096> [sniffs] [laughs] Too late, I'm already on<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,Timberwolf!
Spike,Timberwolf!
Applejack,Whooooah!
Applejack,Ow!
Spike,"Uh oh... Applejack, come on!"
Applejack,[grunting] I can't! I'm really stuck!
Spike,No more messing around! Let's go!
Applejack,[grunting] Come on...
Applejack,"Forget it, Spike! You gotta get out of here! Would you just forget your dragon code already and go?!"
Spike,No! I have to save you!
Twilight Sparkle,What happened to you guys back there? Thought you were right behind us!
Applejack,"My hoof was stuck, and that timberwolf was coming right at me!"
Rarity,"Wait, you were actually stuck?"
Spike,Uh-huh!
Applejack,"But Spike picked up a pebble, and rocketed that thing right at the huge timberwolf's mouth, and saved my life!"
Spike,"Aw, it was nothing."
Applejack,"It was somethin' alright! 'Course, I wouldn't've needed help if I hadn't been tryin' to stage a fake timberwolf attack in the first place."
Spike,"Yeah, what was that all about?"
Applejack,"[sighs] I know this code thing's important to you, but if somethin' like this comes up in the future, think maybe we can go back to my code, say ""that's what friends do"" and leave it at that? I promise I won't think of you as any less noble."
Spike,"Sounds good to me. But, maybe let's just try to avoid situations where one of us actually needs the other one to save their life?"
Applejack,You got yourself a deal.
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks, Spike."
Spike,Happy to help!
Twilight Sparkle,Don't know what I'd do without you.
Spike,"No, really! I'm really really really happy to help you!"
Twilight Sparkle,[laughs] Oh...
Pinkie Pie,I love it when Princess Celestia comes to Ponyville! I got my hooves shined just like Rarity for the occasion. Ya like?
Rarity,I certainly do!
Twilight Sparkle,I'm surprised she's not here yet.
Spike,[sighs] I wonder what's taking so long?
Twilight Sparkle,And where are Applejack and Fluttershy?
Rarity,Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres. They'll be along.
Spike,"But, I still don't get why the Princess would be so late."
Twilight Sparkle,She's bringing an important visitor. That could be part of it.
Rainbow Dash,A visitor who's important and slow.
Rarity,"Maybe it's somepony so terribly important, she still had many more terribly important things to do before she got here."
Spike,"[gasp] Maybe the visitor has a deer antler, a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, right. That's Discord."
Rarity,"Why in the wide, wide world of Equestria would Princess Celestia bring along someone like that?"
Spike,M-m-maybe you should ask... her!
Rarity,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"With all due respect, Princess Celestia, how could you bring Discord here?! [clears throat] Your majesty."
Princess Celestia,"I'm fully aware that the last time Discord was here, he created serious havoc."
Rainbow Dash,"If by ""serious havoc"" you mean ""turning Ponyville into the chaos capital of the world""..."
Rarity,...and tricking us all into being the opposite of our true selves...
Pinkie Pie,And making yummy delicious chocolate milk rain all over the place without a single dollop of whipped cream to go with it anywhere in sight! Not a single dollop!
Princess Celestia,"Yes, I understand. But I have use for Discord's magic if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil. This is why I've brought Discord here, because I believe that you are the ponies who can help him do just that."
Spike,This will never work! This is a disaster! How will we ever control him?! We're doomed!
Princess Celestia,Need I remind you that you are the ponies who turned him back into stone like this in the first place?
Twilight Sparkle,I suppose we can just use the Elements of Harmony against him again if it gets out of hand.
Spike,"Uh, w-w-we probably need a volunteer to run away from here right away to get them. I'll do it!"
Princess Celestia,"No need, Spike. I have them right here, and I've cast a spell so Discord can't take them and hide them again. Now where is Fluttershy? I believe she may know best how to begin reforming Discord."
Rainbow Dash,Fluttershy? Really?
Applejack,What's he goin' on about now?
Fluttershy,Good news. Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed to take his dam apart and move it.
Applejack,"Well, it's about time. My apple trees are so waterlogged, I can practically hear 'em gargle!"
Fluttershy,"But he says first you'll have to apologize for calling him ""a nuisance""."
Applejack,Apologize? He's lucky I didn't call him a varmint!
Fluttershy,[gasps] Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth! Such language!
Applejack,"Fine, fine. I apologize."
Applejack,"[sighs] Thanks, Fluttershy. Don't know what I would've done without you."
Fluttershy,Glad I could help.
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, slackers! Double time it on over to Ponyville, would ya?! We're all waiting on you!"
Princess Celestia,"I realize that this is a tall order, but I wouldn't ask if I weren't confident you could get him to use magic obediently of his own free will."
Fluttershy,And... you really think I'll know best how to do that?
Princess Celestia,"I do. Now, I must return to Canterlot for Equestria's royal summit. You may release Discord when ready."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, ponies, guess it's time to get started. Let's just hope this releasing spell works."
Spike,Or... let's not.
Twilight Sparkle,We'd best keep our elements on at all times 'til further notice.
Rest of main cast,Check!
Twilight Sparkle,What do you think you're doing?!
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Make that bunny cute again! Now!
Discord,Oh... [sniggers] He's adorable the way he is.
Discord,"[blows raspberry] You know what else is adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks..."
Twilight Sparkle,How'd you know about that?!
Discord,Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, unless you want us to turn you back to stone, you'll zap those animals back the way they were, pronto!"
Discord,"Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess."
Rainbow Dash,"Try us, ""Dip-cord""!"
Fluttershy,You think you can treat poor defenseless animals like that and get away with it?!
Rainbow Dash,"You go, Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy,"You'd best watch your step, buster, or I'll give you... the Stare!"
Twilight Sparkle,"If it turns out we need to use our elements against you, I'm sure we can convince Princess Celestia it was for a good reason!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, dear."
Fluttershy,"He may be horrible, but that doesn't mean we have to act the same way. We should at least try to be hospitable. [to Angel] You don't mind giving up your favorite spot on the couch, do you, Angel Bunny?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sorry about Angel. Are you alright?"
Discord,"Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate..."
Rainbow Dash,"Don't listen to him, Fluttershy! He's just trying to drive a wedge between us like he always does."
Discord,Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that?
Rainbow Dash,"So we can't unite and use the Elements of Harmony against you, that's why!"
Discord,I never thought of that...
Rainbow Dash,You big liar!
Discord,"Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all."
Applejack,I can't watch...
Rainbow Dash,We'll be outside.
Twilight Sparkle,You sure you're okay with this?
Fluttershy,"I know it's not gonna be easy, but Princess Celestia's counting on me. And... I think I actually know what to do."
Twilight Sparkle,You do?
Fluttershy,I think the key is to befriend him. Being kind to him and letting him be my house guest is probably the best way to do that.
Twilight Sparkle,And you really think that'll work?
Fluttershy,I think it's worth a try.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, but if you need us, all you need to do is whisper ""help"", and we'll be back here with our elements. [to Discord] So watch that goat-legged step of yours, pal!"
Discord,Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already.
Rarity,She's really alright with him staying there?
Twilight Sparkle,That's what she said.
Rainbow Dash,"Personally, I think we should come up with a backup plan, in case this whole ""befriending"" business doesn't work out."
Rarity,"Rainbow Dash is right. This is Discord we are talking about, girls. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have another trick up our sleeves."
Twilight Sparkle,And I think I know just the trick.
Fluttershy,"Discord? Oh, there you are. Listen, Discord, I just want to make sure you know that if there's anything I can do to<U+0096> uh, umm, are you eating... paper?"
Fluttershy,"Well, um... I'm just heading out, so you just make yourself at home while I'm gone."
Discord,"Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye..."
Discord,"You like carrots, Angel? I'm playing your owner for a fool! [laughs] How d'ya like them carrots?"
Twilight Sparkle,"That's weird. The spell I had in mind isn't in here. Spike, where are the other books I asked you to pull?"
Spike,"Right here, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,I really want to have a reforming spell up and running pronto.
Spike,But what if he makes the Elements of Harmony disappear like he did last time?
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia cast a spell protecting them, remember? Uh-oh."
Spike,What's wrong?
Discord,"[eating] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds."
Fluttershy,"Nngh... I did say that, so... if this makes you more comfortable... by all means, please feel free."
Discord,"Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours."
Fluttershy,[gasps] My friends aren't nasty!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy! Fluttershy, can you hear me?"
Fluttershy,Goodness! I hear Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, what's going on? Are you okay?!"
Fluttershy,"We're fine. Everything's going great. Isn't it, Angel?"
Twilight Sparkle,"We've come to get you away from Discord! He's just terrible and, from the looks of it, completely out of control!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, but you're wrong! We're making great progress!"
Twilight Sparkle and Spike,Seriously?!
Fluttershy,I'm earning his trust by giving him a little space to be himself.
Spike,"Hate to break it to ya, but he used that ""space to be himself"" to tear out all the reforming spells from the library!"
Fluttershy,That does explain the paper eating...
Twilight Sparkle,He ate them?! Ugggghhhh!
Fluttershy,But we aren't gonna need a spell. He's already really considering being reformed! He said so.
Twilight Sparkle,And you believed him?
Fluttershy,"If I'm going to be his friend, I have to start by giving him the benefit of the doubt! Tell you what. Bring all the ponies over for a dinner party this evening, and I'll bet his manners will have really improved by then. I'll even get him to put the cottage back on the ground first."
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Alright. Dinner it is.
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, I can't believe we're having a dinner party with Discord!"
Rarity,This evening is sure to be a disaster. Glad I didn't bother wearing my fanciest outfit.
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy thinks this is the way to reform Discord and asked us to give it a chance.
Discord,"Oh, our pony guests! [upper class voice] We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in."
Fluttershy,See what a beautiful job he did helping? Discord set the entire table himself. I'm so proud.
Discord,"May I take your... [clears throat] hats, ladies?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hang on to your elements, girls. It's gonna be a bumpy night."
Fluttershy,"As you all know, Princess Celestia hoped we'd help Discord use his magic for good instead of evil."
Fluttershy,"Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy?"
Pinkie Pie,You bet!
Discord,Allow me.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, what a cute little gravy boat you are! Yes you are! Yes you are!"
Rainbow Dash,That's one creepy little gravy boat if you ask me.
Fluttershy,"Oh, come on now, Dashie. You're not even giving this a chance."
Rainbow Dash,Hey! That's hot!
Discord,Whoops! [chuckles] I'm so sorry!
Rainbow Dash,He did that on purpose!
Discord,"Oh, well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles!"
Rainbow Dash,I'm not falling for that! Discord's just trying to distract us from<U+0096>
Rainbow Dash,"[grunts] Hey! Knock it off! I suppose that's another ""mistake""?"
Discord,"No, I think you just made them mad."
Twilight Sparkle,There's something fishy going on.
Fluttershy,Discord?
Discord,"Well, it's hardly my fault if the soup tureen finds the term ""something fishy"" to be offensive."
Rarity,Not the dress! Not the dress!
Applejack,That tureen's only doin' what you're makin' it do!
Fluttershy,Now let's not jump to any conclusions.
Rainbow Dash,Fluttershy! Can't you see what he's doing? He's playing innocent with you so you'll never agree to use the Elements of Harmony against him!
Discord,"Oh, well, that's a bit harsh, isn't it?"
Rainbow Dash,"You see what I'm saying, right, Fluttershy? Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy,"You know what I see? I see that Discord's far from perfect, but I also see none of you giving him a chance!"
Rainbow Dash,What's gotten into you?! Why do you keep cutting him so much slack?
Fluttershy,Because that's what friends do.
Discord,We're friends?
Fluttershy,"Why, of course! I can't remember my house ever being this lively before you came along."
Discord,"Oh... Well, I've... never really had a friend before."
Fluttershy,"Well, now you do!"
Fluttershy,"Now is not a good time, Angel. We're having a dinner party."
Applejack,Hold up! I-I think he's tryin' to tell us somethin'!
Main cast sans Fluttershy,Apple!
Main cast sans Fluttershy and Applejack,Applejack!
Rarity,"Oh, oh, oh! Sweet Apple Acres?"
Rainbow Dash,"Flooding at Sweet Apple Acres! And we all know who's behind that now, don't we?!"
Discord,"Who, me?"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, give it a rest! What do you think of your ""friend"" now, Fluttershy?"
Applejack,"I've never seen the floodin' this bad! They've built dams 'round here before, but never like this! What's goin' on?"
Fluttershy,[gasps] Such language! [sighs] It's no use. They won't listen to a word I say!
Rainbow Dash,"You see Discord's behind all this, right?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, of course I do! Do you all think I'm a silly, gullible fool?"
Fluttershy,"I've just been trying to gain his friendship any way I can, so he'd come to trust and listen to me!"
Discord,"Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn? The water's great!"
Fluttershy,Time to see if it worked.
Discord,"Fluttershy, oh, there you are. A sight for sore eyes."
Fluttershy,"As you can see, there's a big mess down here at Sweet Apple Acres."
Discord,"Oh, yes. Awful business, that. Mm."
Fluttershy,"It is awful. This is Applejack's home, and it's being destroyed by innocent creatures who would never be acting this way if it weren't for your reckless behavior. You need to fix this."
Discord,"Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return."
Fluttershy,Yes?
Discord,I ask that you never use your Element of Harmony against me. As a sign of our friendship.
Fluttershy,I will never use my Element of Harmony against you.
Fluttershy,"Discord! That's not fixing it! Why, I oughta..."
Discord,"Where are you going? What's wrong, pal?"
Fluttershy,Don't call me your pal!
Discord,"Oh, pfft, come skating with me, and we'll let bygones be bygones."
Spike,"Here you go, Fluttershy! Game on!"
Twilight Sparkle,He fixes this or he goes back to being stone! Princess Celestia will understand!
Fluttershy,"I made a promise not to use my element against him, and I'm going to keep it."
Fluttershy,[growls] Not. Your. Friend!
Discord,"Who cares? I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. I'm Discord, the master of chaos! You think you can boss Discord around? You think I'm just going to turn all this back because you say so? Because if I don't, I'll lose the one friend I ever had? [pause] Oh. Oh. Well played, Fluttershy. Well played."
Discord,"I like it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh?"
Discord,"Yes, Princess, I'm ready to use my magic for good instead of evil. [under his breath] Most of the time."
Princess Celestia,"Congratulations on your success, ponies. I definitely sense a big change in Discord. [to Twilight] I'll leave the Elements of Harmony with you, Twilight. Just in case."
Twilight Sparkle,"You were right when you said Fluttershy would be the one to find the way to reform Discord. By treating Discord as a friend, she got him to realize that friendship was actually important to him. And something that, once he had, he didn't want to lose."
Fluttershy,Go on. Say it...
Discord,[groans] Alright. [quickly] Friendship is magic.
Fluttershy,See? He can be a real sweetheart once you get to know him.
Spike,Who are you hooing at?
Spike,"I know, they're delicious."
Spike,"Now you see 'em, now you don't. [chewing] [belches] Mm! [singing] This is how you make a jewel cake: stir in some gems, and then you bake. [chewing] Mm-hmm! Gonna, eat, eat it up! Gonna<U+0096> [gasps] What happened to all my jewels?! [drums claws] I had a bowl full of them here, and now I don't! Which means somebody took 'em!"
Spike,"Who? That's what I'm asking, who?! Who took my jewels?! Oh. I'm who. This cake was gonna be so good! Why? [thump] Why?! [gulps] Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!"
Spike,[singing] I have no jewels... I have no cake... I'm a sad little dragon... With nothing to<U+0096>
Spike,...is it?
Fluttershy,"Oh! Oh goodness, I-I hope I'm not interrupting anything."
Spike,Well... I do have this cake to not bake...
Fluttershy,"Oh... sorry, it's a bad time."
Spike,"Uh, inside joke. Talk to me."
Fluttershy,It's just that... Princess Cadance needs us to do a great job welcoming the Head of the Equestria Games when she visits the Crystal Empire tomorrow<U+0096>
Spike,"Oh, I know all about that. As if I wouldn't be any help at welcoming..."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I don't know what was I thinking. Of course you might be upset for not being invited, and... here I am coming to ask you for a favor. You were probably going to say no anyway. All I had to offer you in exchange was one little jewel."
Spike,What was that?
Fluttershy,[yelps] All I have is this jewel.
Spike,"[slurp] That's a really big one. A really big, juicy, perfect-for-a-cake-topper jewel."
Fluttershy,Does this mean you'll do it?
Spike,Yeah... Sure...
Fluttershy,"Oh, thank you, thank you! So while I'm gone, you'll take care of Angel, and tomorrow is Tuesday, which is his tail-fluffing day, and it's really important for him to look good."
Spike,"Wait, what? You want me to take care of him?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, well, yes. But if it's too much trouble, I can always see if there is somepony else."
Spike,"Uhh... We already agreed on the whole jewel thing, so I'll just..."
Fluttershy,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! Angel, aren't you just so excited?"
Fluttershy,See you tomorrow.
Spike,You know... She's not the only pony with a pet that might need some watching...
Spike,"All I'm saying is, if Fluttershy thought that her beloved little friend shouldn't be left alone while you're busy in the Crystal Empire, then maybe that's just something to think about."
Rainbow Dash,Tch! Tank's not some fuzzy little bunny. He can take care of himself.
Rainbow Dash,"He's a strong, fearless, and totally together pet."
Rainbow Dash,"Alright. You can watch him, but only because... uh... Tank's got a strict flying regimen, and-and someone needs to make sure that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone."
Rainbow Dash,You know... the two of us are very diligent.
Spike,"Okay, whatever."
Rarity,"Yes, yes, more importantly, as for Opal, she likes to eat every thirty six and a half minutes, you groom her with her silken brush, head to toe..."
Rarity,"...Oh, and don't forget to pooch her pillow out in the middle, that's where she likes it. And the temperature in the room should always be exactly eighty one point four degrees. That's the only way she can get to sleep."
Rarity,"And, um... hmm... oh, good, so thanks for your help and good luck to you."
Rainbow Dash,A-hem... I think the dragon was expecting a little something for his efforts.
Spike,Almost as beautiful as the pony who gave it to me...
Rainbow Dash,Shouldn't you be critter-proofing the library or something? Tank has a tendency to<U+0096>
Spike,"Critter-proofing. Yeah, I'll get right on that. [chuckles] Three down, three to go."
Spike,"What's that you said, Gummy? Uh-huh. Well, you're just gonna have to ask Pinkie Pie about that one."
Pinkie Pie,"Ask me, ask me!"
Spike,"Go ahead, ask her!"
Pinkie Pie,Of course you can have another cupcake! Mm? Mm-hm? Yeah? Why didn't you say so? I'll get you a bigger pond immediately.
Spike,I think what Gummy's trying to say is<U+0096>
Spike,I think what Gummy's trying to say is that he'd like a little Spike time.
Pinkie Pie,Who wouldn't?! Spike time is the best!
Spike,"Alas, it doesn't come cheap."
Rainbow Dash,All I'm saying is you might wanna think about a helmet. You only want to get hit in the head by a flying turtle... once.
Spike,A thousand plus carats of pure deliciousness...
Applejack,"Looks like you got a regular pet day care in here, Spike. You'll still be able to get some good play time with Winona like you said though, won't ya? She tends to get a little wild if she doesn't get her exercise."
Spike,"Exercise. Sure, of course."
Spike,Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,I don't remember seeing critters on the invite list.
Applejack,That's 'cause we're leavin' them here with Spike. He's gonna do a little critter-sittin' for us.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, really?"
Fluttershy,"So sorry I'm late. Silly bunny had hidden his brush. Be sure you get plenty on his tail, or it won't get as poofy as he likes it."
Pinkie Pie,"No, no no no. I love you more. No, I love you more! I love you more!!!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, I promise it'll be okay. I'll fluff your tail twice next week. Three times?"
Rarity,"Oh, I know. It's a chilly eighty one point two in here. Spike, take care of this, would you please?"
Spike,"You got it! So, uhh... What are you thinking about that hooting little friend of yours? Suppose you want me to keep an eye on him too."
Twilight Sparkle,That would be nice. You sure you don't already have your hands full?
Spike,"Nah, pshaw. I'll be fine. But, uh, just between you and me, I gotta give priority to the... paying customers."
Twilight Sparkle,[sigh] You absolutely sure you can do this?
Spike,"Of course. Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't. Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, like keeping an eye on a house full of critters."
Spike,"[slurp] Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about. Relax. Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire. Spike's got it all under control."
Spike,"Alright, sidekicks, front and center!"
Spike,"There are six of you, but there's only one right here in front of me... Gah! Two! And what I say goes!"
Spike,"Spike, the boss of you, that's who. One, two, three! Nngh, come on, number four!"
Spike,Whoa! Guh...
Spike,"One, two, three, four, five... Argh, who's missing?"
Spike,Angel.
Spike,"All I wanted were some jewels. Big, juicy, delicious jewels. Now what do I have? A missing rabbit and<U+0096>"
Sweetie Belle,"Awww, little fluffy Angel Bunny-kins! You're so cute! The natural weaves in his fluff are to die for!"
Sweetie Belle,Isn't Angel just the cutest thing you've ever seen?!
Spike,"[to Angel] Look, you don't wanna be with me. I'd rather not chase you around all over the place when I could be enjoying some jewel cake. Watch me solve both of our problems. [to the Cutie Mark Crusaders] Y'know, I'm supposed to be watching him, but you all have just hit it off so well that maybe, maybe I could let you take care of him instead."
Apple Bloom,"We would, but we've got some major Crusaders business planned for today!"
Scootaloo,Major. We're getting our skydiving cutie marks today!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Ha! Yeah!
Spike,"Well, I suppose, if you've got other plans... It's just, you're so good with them. Like get-a-cutie-mark-for-bunny-sitting good?"
Apple Bloom,A bunny-sittin' cutie mark...
Sweetie Belle,That would be adorable!
Scootaloo,He does seem to like us.
Apple Bloom,And we haven't exactly figured out how we're gonna pull off this whole skydivin' thing.
Spike,"You know what? As hard as it's gonna be for me part with these little guys, I think you should probably just take all of them. If you ask me, nngh, the more critters you take care of, the more chances you have of getting some kind of critter-sitting cutie mark. Am I right or am I right?"
Apple Bloom,Sure!
Spike,Yes!
Apple Bloom,But wait! How're we gonna take good care of them without treats for when they're good?
Sweetie Belle,And we'll need beds for when they're tired!
Scootaloo,And toys! They need toys!
Spike,It's an afternoon. They don't need all that stuff. They'll be fine.
Apple Bloom,We need to be able to buy them some things! One jewel might be able to cover it all.
Spike,Uh... what would I possibly be doing with jewels?
Apple Bloom,"I happen to know for a fact that Applejack gave you a gem to watch Winona, which means..."
Spike,"Obviously, no one around here is getting a cutie mark for kindness toward a poor, hungry little dragon. Take it or leave it."
Apple Bloom,We'll take it.
Spike,"[singing] Gonna put in some flour, and add a little sugar for my five de-li-cious jewels!"
Sweetie Belle,[muffled] But pink feathers would look so good with your eyes!
Spike,Meh... that bird could use a little color.
Scootaloo,[muffled] Has anyone seen Tank's head? Where's his head?!
Spike,What have you done to the turtle?!
Scootaloo,"Ohh, I totally forgot he could do that. Heh."
Apple Bloom,"Yeah, so, pretty sure critter-sittin' cutie marks are out."
Sweetie Belle,And our critter-grooming cutie marks probably aren't going to appear anytime soon either.
Spike,"[groans] Alright, load 'em up. And you can gimme back that jewel I gave you."
Apple Bloom,"Sorry, we don't have it anymore."
Spike,What? Why not?!
Scootaloo,How do you think we paid for the industrial-sized pet hair dryer?
Spike,[groans] Oh.
Zecora,Zecora knows just what to do about all this bad mojo that's floating around you.
Spike,I'm thinking a cage and a great big lock might be next.
Zecora,Zecora can take the bad away if you do just what I say.
Spike,Really?
Zecora,"But before I can do my duty, I am going to need some of your booty."
Spike,[sighs] Where are you going?
Zecora,"You think jewels are what you need, but there's no worse mojo than dragon greed."
Spike,Almost there...
Granny Smith,[suspiciously] Mm-hm...
Spike,"Just taking good care of everyone's animals. What am I gonna have to do to get this to go away? [sighs] And this is just between you and me, right? No other pony has to hear a word about it?"
Granny Smith,A word about what now?
Spike,This better be important.
Conductor,All aboard!
Spike,Angel.
Conductor,I can't have all of these animals on my train. Not without tickets and not without chaperones.
Spike,"All I need is to get on for one minute, grab a bunny, and get off! Promise!"
Conductor,"[laughs] Likely story. No chaperone, no train."
Scootaloo,Skydiving cutie marks!
Spike,"Is three ponies enough? [sighs] At least I have you two left, my delectable little treasures."
Conductor,All aboard for the Crystal Empire!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Crystal Empire?!
Scootaloo,I've always wanted to see the Crystal Empire!
Sweetie Belle,"I wish I were dressed for it, but still... [squealing] THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE!"
Spike,"We're not really going! We just needed to get on the train so I can get that rabbit! And when I do, we're off!"
Scootaloo,What?!
Apple Bloom,That's not fair!
Spike,There he is!
Conductor,"Next stop, the Crystal Empire!"
Spike,"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Apple Bloom,"So it seems like the Crystal Empire would be really cold, but I've heard that it's not! It's as warm as can be!"
Scootaloo,Do you think the walls are crystal? [gasps] Maybe even see-through! Can you imagine see-through walls?
Spike,Take it! Just take it!
Scootaloo,So beautiful!
Spike,"Well, enjoy it while you can, 'cause we're not getting out of this car until we're back in Ponyville!"
Apple Bloom,"There is no way, no how, we're comin' all the way to the Crystal Empire without lookin' around!"
Spike,Nopony's gonna get past this dragon!
Apple Bloom,Don't make me use this!
Scootaloo,"Whoa, just whoa."
Sweetie Belle,Ah! I'm in crystal heaven!
Spike,"Shhh! They're right there! There's the bunny! Please, please, pretty please, don't go down there! I'll fluff your tail! I'll perm, highlight, and blow it out if you'll just stop!"
Spike,"What do you want?! Name it, and it's yours! [pants] [groans] [kisses] Hyah!"
Fluttershy,Oh my goodness.
Conductor,All aboard!
Spike,Hah! You're coming with me!
Spike,We made it!
Sweetie Belle,Without seeing the palace!
Twilight Sparkle,I think this car's empty.
Spike,They're coming this way! Everybody down!
Sweetie Belle,There has to be a better solution!
Spike,"Shh! Oh, don't sit down, don't sit down!"
Applejack,Whooeee! My dogs are barkin'.
Applejack,Did y'all hear that? They really are!
Rainbow Dash,"Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home.
Applejack,Think he's still got a handle on things?
Twilight Sparkle,"If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader."
Spike,"Go ahead, bunny. Do your worst. I deserve it. I ignored you, tried to pawn you off on someone else, I didn't take these silly things out, or fluff this like I was supposed to. I wasn't really thinking about you at all. Any of you. Just wanted the jewels. I hope you'll all forgive me someday."
Spike,You will? [stomach growls] Oh great. I'm gonna be the one who gives us away.
Applejack,You all hear that?
Applejack,"I can't wait to scratch the belly on Winona. Oh, I miss her."
Spike,Hello! Thought we'd meet you at the station!
Sweetie Belle,"So we could hear all about the Crystal Empire, and find out if you brought us one of the crystal snow globes that they sell at the train station!"
Rarity,How did you know about the snow globes?
Sweetie Belle,Um... lucky guess?
Twilight Sparkle,"I've gotta hand it to you, Spike. You did a really good job of taking care of the animals."
Fluttershy,"Oh, Spike, Angel looks perfect! You did such a good job fluffing his tail."
Spike,"Yeah, well... we're like this now."
Spike,You know who.
Twilight Sparkle,"So what are you thinking? Bake 'em into a jewel pie? Ooh, six-layer gem cake sounds pretty good!"
Spike,"Yeah, it does. [slurps] It really really does. [pause] Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!"
Twilight Sparkle,You absolutely sure you can do this?
Spike,"Of course. Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't. Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, like keeping an eye on a house full of critters."
Spike,"[slurp] Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about. Relax. Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire. Spike's got it all under control."
Rainbow Dash,"Hurry up, Twilight! We can't miss our train!"
Conductor,Tickets.
Applejack,"Oh, this is gonna be a real treat. Princess Cadance said she'd never seen the Crystal Ponies so excited."
Rainbow Dash,Duh! Of course they're excited. They're up for the Equestria Games. It's only the biggest sporting event in all of Equestria.
Rarity,Didn't Cloudsdale host the Equestria Games one year?
Rainbow Dash,No. Cloudsdale should have hosted the games one year. I'll never forget when we got the bad news.
Laurette,The Equestria Games go to... the city of Fillydelphia.
Young Rainbow Dash,NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Rainbow Dash,These Crystal Ponies lost a thousand years to an evil king's curse. They've had enough bad news. No way we're letting them experience the pain of losing out on these games.
Twilight Sparkle,Exactly. Princess Cadance is counting on us to do our part to convince the Games Inspector to choose the Crystal Empire. And we are not gonna let her down. Are we?
Pinkie Pie,NOOOOOOOOOOO! What? I was just answering Twilight's question.
Main cast,"Four, three, two, one! The Crystal Empire, that's the one!"
Pinkie Pie,"[through megaphone] Okay, everypony, great job! Sounds like we're ready."
Twilight Sparkle,One more time from the top.
Rarity,"Oh, please! I think that was perfect."
Applejack,"[sighs] But we've run this, like, twelve times already. I think we've got it."
Twilight Sparkle,Cadance said the Games Inspector really puts folks through the wringer on her visits. There's no margin for error here. And this time we need to practice the steps.
Applejack,On a train car?
Rainbow Dash,You heard the pony! On your hooves!
Train Conductor,"Crystal Empire, ladies! Watch your step leaving the train!"
Applejack,"[sighs] Probably should've watched our step while we were still on it, too."
Pinkie Pie,Wow! The Crystal Empire looks crystallier than ever!
Applejack,They must have everypony in the Empire out sprucing it up!
Twilight Sparkle,This must be why we were asked to handle the welcome committee routine.
Rainbow Dash,And it's probably also because we'll be awesome at it.
Applejack,Princess Cadance was right. These ponies do look pretty darn excited.
Rainbow Dash,"Yup, I remember that feeling. But not as much as I remember the crushing wave of disappointment that came when things didn't work out. That right there. That is the face I do not want to see."
Twilight Sparkle,We're here.
Princess Cadance,[giggles] There are my girls.
Twilight and Cadance,"Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake!"
Rarity,"Oh, my. This is spectacular. Please, everypony, stand back! I need air!"
Princess Cadance,Go ahead and try whatever you like. It's all complimentary for the welcome committee.
Rarity,Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Princess Cadance,"That over there is a crystal mud bath, which relaxes your body and rejuvenates your coat. Now, I realize it can be kind of strange to climb into mud, but if you'll just give it a chance, I'm sure<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,Woo-hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, no!"
Pinkie Pie,"[laughing] Ahh, so relaxing!"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie Pie! Honestly!
Princess Cadance,"Go ahead, have a good time while I get my ceremonial headdress done."
Rarity,Ceremonial... headdress?
Princess Cadance,"When meeting with important guests, it was tradition for rulers of the Crystal Empire to weave crystals into their manes in a very specific way. The Games Inspector is known for doing her homework. She'll certainly be expecting my look to reflect the importance of her visit."
Golden Hooves,"Princess, if I may have a word... I-I have two pieces of news for you. First, your mane stylist has the flu and won't be able to make it for fear of you catching it, too."
Princess Cadance,Oh. Well... I hope she's better soon. Do any of the other stylists here know how to do the traditional royal ceremonial headdress?
Crystal Ponies,Um... well... uh... (No.)
Princess Cadance,Oh. [breaths in] [breaths out] Just a... small detail.
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're trying to land the Equestria Games here. There is no such thing as a small detail!"
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash!
Rarity,I suppose... I could give it a shot.
Princess Cadance,"Oh, Rarity, you would do that for me?"
Rainbow Dash,"Way to step it up, Rare!"
Princess Cadance,"Fortunately, I have all the precise instructions right here."
Rarity,"Oh, my!"
Princess Cadance,You sure you're up to this?
Rarity,Working on the hair of royalty on such an auspicious occasion is the opportunity of a lifetime! I will give it everything I've got!
Twilight Sparkle,See? No worries!
Rarity,"Besides, the Games Inspector isn't expected for several hours. I'll have plenty of time to figure out exactly how to... do... this..."
Princess Cadance,"Oh, Rarity, that's wonderful! [to Golden Hooves] You said you had a second bit of news?"
Golden Hooves,"Yes, quite. The Games Inspector, Ms. Harshwhinny, will be arriving on the... next train."
Rainbow Dash,What!? You couldn't have told her that news first!? That's fifteen minutes from now!
Fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness!"
Twilight Sparkle,[breathes in] [breathes out] How long before Cadance is ready?
Rarity,Hmmmm... I'm sure to find some shortcuts.
Twilight Sparkle,Can you have her back at the castle when we're done?
Rarity,Done.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, we'll be fine. Everypony, just be on the look out for the pony with the flower print luggage."
Pinkie Pie,"Easy peasy, pudding in the freezy!"
Twilight Sparkle,"We bring the Games Inspector back to the castle, put on our big welcome committee how-do-you-do and then..."
Pinkie Pie,Put the pudding out to thaw before you eat it or you'll crack a tooth?
Rainbow Dash,I'll just ignore that. We need to remember that the Games Inspector arriving early is probably part of a plan to psych us out.
Twilight Sparkle,What do you mean?
Rainbow Dash,"You said it yourself. She's got a rep for trying to catch hosts off-guard, just to see if we can handle the kind of massive pressure that comes with hosting the Equestria Games."
Fluttershy,"Oh, no... We're gonna blow it..."
Rainbow Dash,"Not if we always stay one step ahead and don't fall for any of her mind games. Anything she throws at us, we just need to remember she's testing us and roll with it."
Rainbow Dash,"Excuse me, ma'am?"
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Yes, what is it?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, no!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Be cool. [to Ms. Peachbottom] Well, I know you're not expecting us, but we're here to personally welcome you to the Crystal Empire."
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. The whole lot of you came to do that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, well, um... yes!"
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Well, darn tootin', ain't that the cat's meow! Y'all didn't need to do that. Why, I hardly expected anything like this."
Applejack,Whew! The Princess wouldn't have had it any other way.
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. The Princess? Princess Cadance?
Twilight Sparkle,None other!
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Well, tie me up and throw me down! This just keeps gettin' better and better!"
Fluttershy,Can we help you with your bags?
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. Don't mind if ya do!
Fluttershy,"Ooh, I love flower print! Sorry."
Pinkie Pie,"Our first stop is the castle, where we got a big razzamatazzy welcome planned for you!"
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. The castle? Are you kidding?! Hot-diggety-dawg!
Twilight Sparkle,See that? We just gotta roll with it until the Princess gets there and we'll be just fine.
Princess Cadance,"So, uh... how's it going so far?"
Rarity,"Oh, I'm so sorry... It's just... oh so complicated. [laughs nervously] I can fix it!"
Princess Cadance,Fix what?!
Rarity,"Well, I-I was looking for shortcuts and I thought step twelve was optional! But it's not!"
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. My golly, the crystal castle! [gasps] Why, I've seen pictures, but I never expected to see it with my very own eyes! [gulps] From the inside..."
Fluttershy,"Oh, my gosh, she's so nice!"
Rainbow Dash,You're letting her lull you into a false sense of confidence. Watch that. It's all part of the game.
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, my, I'm so excited."
Twilight Sparkle,"Please, have a seat, won't you?"
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. Mind if I take a quick run outside first? It was an awfully long train ride and my legs could use a stretch.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, well... we were just about to start."
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. Oh! Never you mind. You go on ahead. I'm listening.
Rainbow Dash,She was probably testing us to see if we could remain in control of a complex situation. Looks like we passed. Bump<U+0096>
Fluttershy,<U+0096>cha!
Twilight Sparkle,We'd like to thank you for this opportunity to introduce you to this wonderful kingdom!
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, why, the pleasure is all mine."
Twilight Sparkle,"And since we're not even from here ourselves, who better than us to let you know just how welcoming this place can be!"
Main cast,"Two, four, six, eight! Name a place that's really great! One, two, three, four! Keeps you coming back for more! Two, seven, nine, three! The place that we all wanna be! Four, three, two, one! The Crystal Empire, that's the one!"
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Ooh, I tell ya! I have traveled far and wide, but I have never, ever been welcomed anyplace in the fashion that y'all have done here today."
Twilight Sparkle,That's fantastic! Princess Cadance would be so glad to hear that!
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Honestly, I'm surprised she knows anything about me at all!"
Twilight Sparkle,Of course she does! She's been looking forward to your visit for weeks!
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, goody! Is she here?"
Twilight Sparkle,Uh...
Applejack,[hushed] Where the heck is she anyway? Wasn't she supposed to be here by now?
Rainbow Dash,"Or, if you like, we could give you a tour of the castle! That way you could be learning and stretching all at the same time!"
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Ooh, a tour of the crystal castle... I'd love that a whole heap."
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] Dash! We've hardly ever even been here before!
Rainbow Dash,"[hushed] It's just another test! We gotta roll with it, remember?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oooh! Lemme give the tour! I'lldoit, I'lldoit, letmeletmeletme!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[breathes in] [breathes out] Fine. You all start giving her the tour, and I'll go see what's keeping Cadance."
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. Oof!
Twilight Sparkle,Hello there!
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. Hello yourself. First hello of the day<U+0096>
Rarity,[gasps] W-What are you doing here?
Twilight Sparkle,We finished the welcome committee song and we just wanted to introduce Ms. Harshwhinny to<U+0096>
Rarity,"No, no! Princess Cadance isn't ready. Something's gone terribly wrong!"
Twilight Sparkle,I need to speak to the Princess.
Rarity,You can't! You mustn't! She's in the middle of a delicate conditioning rinse that must go perfectly if there's to be any hope for her hair!
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, how bad can it be?"
Rarity,Imagine her mane turned into a porcupine.
Twilight Sparkle,Ew.
Rarity,"Please! I will bring her back from the brink of tragedy, but you have got to buy me some time! There's no other way!"
Pinkie Pie,"So, you see this here? This, um, this is, um... a big, round room. It's known for its roundness and bigness. And did I mention that it's round?"
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. I think they call it a rotunda? A small, confining, rotunda..."
Pinkie Pie,"[blows raspberry] Whatever. Round is round, am I right?"
Applejack,"[hushed] Easy, Pinkie, let's play this safe! We got her in a good mood, so let's not do anything to ruin that."
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. You know... I love this sort of architecture. I-I-I detect a neo-Gothic inspiration in the design, yes?"
Applejack,[sighs] And not a moment too soon. Where's Cadance? Please tell me she's right behind you.
Twilight Sparkle,There's a bit of a problem with her headdress. How's it going here?
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. I, uh, hate to be a bother, but the legs are cramping up on me with all this standing around..."
Rainbow Dash,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"She's getting bored, and we have to buy Rarity some more time. [breathes in] [breathes out] I'll see if Shining Armor can come help. Can't one of you other ponies take over in the meantime?"
Rainbow Dash,"I got this. Wanna stretch your legs, huh? Well, whatever you need, I'm sure we can provide. Let's just make our way to the castle's gymnasium. Our tour will now be headed... this way. And we're walking, and we're walking..."
Shining Armor,Twily!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hello there! Shining Armor, you've gotta help me."
Shining Armor,[blows whistle] Everything okay?
Twilight Sparkle,I left the other ponies behind giving the Games Inspector the worst castle tour ever.
Shining Armor,"Come on, gang! Are we gonna gallop, or are we gonna trot!? [to Twilight] Castle tour, huh? I'm pretty sure I can give you a hoof with that. [to athletes] Let's move, move, move! [to Twilight] Everything's gonna be okay."
Twilight Sparkle,"I know, I'm not worried. I'm not worried... it worked!"
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. [gasping] I'm outside! [laughing] Feels so good to stretch the old legs!
Shining Armor,"Uh, what the<U+0096>"
Rainbow Dash,Turns out the crystal castle doesn't have a gymnasium.
Shining Armor,Watch it!
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. Woo-hoo!
Shining Armor,Make her stop!
Rainbow Dash,"Wait, that's the Games Inspector! Let her do her thing."
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Good. Oh, these hooves! I'm outside!"
Shining Armor,Why would she do that?
Rainbow Dash,"I have no idea, but that's why she's who's in charge of choosing who gets the Games, and we're not."
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. [muffled] Oh! Oh, get me outside for a run!"
Shining Armor,Look out!
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, okay, we need to stop her."
Fluttershy,Where's she going in such a hurry?
Rainbow Dash,Closer... closer... I think we've got her... Yaaaaaaah!
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Hoo-eee! Oh, that felt good! Nothing like a great run to shake the cobwebs off these old bones."
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Hey there, speedy. Ah, these wide open spaces y'all got here remind me of home. This is great!"
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, good golly, yes. I just love to travel and see new places. Such a beautiful spot you got here, too!"
Shining Armor,Why... thank you so much! I'm Shining Armor.
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. [gasps] The Prince!
Twilight Sparkle,What's going on?
Rainbow Dash,"From the looks of it, just locking up the games for the Crystal Empire is all. Ain't no thing."
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. My, oh, my... I never met a Prince before..."
Shining Armor,[chuckles] I'm surprised. I'd think in your line of work you'd meet princes all the time.
Twilight Sparkle,"You... are Ms. Harshwhinny, the Equestria Games Inspector, aren't you?"
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. Inspector what-now?
Rainbow Dash,We got the wrong pony?!
Pinkie Pie,"NOOOOOOOOOOO! I mean, YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!"
Applejack,"Oh, please still be here... Oh please, oh please, oh please..."
Twilight Sparkle,There's got to be another pony with flower print luggage around here somewhere.
Rainbow Dash,Except that there isn't!
Twilight Sparkle,We've gotta find her before Cadance finds out what a mess we've made of things.
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, here's what we do. We split the Empire up into five sectors."
Fluttershy,Each of us search a sector.
Pinkie Pie,"Well... except for the spa. What's the point of checking there? That's where Cadance is. If Ms. Harshwhinny is there, well, then, game over, right?"
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Every city and empire wants to host the Equestria Games. So, I have to go through all the big phony-baloney song and dance, though of course, I'm never getting the real inside scoop."
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, golly, I've been having a swell time since I got here. I'm actually thinking of extendin' my stay."
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. And what exactly has made your visit so special?
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Oohohohoooh, gosh, where to start?"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, there she is! We're in luck! I don't think either of them knows yet that the other one's here!"
Rarity,"Wonderful news, look! Princess Cadance, better than new!"
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Princess Cadance? So, this is where you've been! I will have you know this is by far the worst welcome I've had in all my years!"
Princess Cadance,I-I can't believe it... What was wrong with your welcome?
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. There wasn't one!
Princess Cadance,What is going on?
Rainbow Dash,"Princess, we gave our welcome to the wrong pony, left the right one waiting at the station, and completely ruined everything."
Rainbow Dash,"When I was a little filly, I wanted so badly for Cloudsdale to win the Equestria Games. But it didn't happen. So I thought I could make up for that disappointment by helping the Crystal Empire win the chance to host the Games. But it looks like I ruined your chances instead."
Ms. Peachbottom,"Ms. Not so fast, speedy."
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. I just finished hearing about how this pony was just treated to the warmest, finest, most fabulous reception she ever had."
Ms. Peachbottom,Ms. Darn tootin'!
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Courtesy of these fine ponies right here. Which, in my expert opinion, amounts to the first ever unvarnished, unrehearsed, and unbiased appraisal of a potential host of the Equestria Games. Which can only mean one thing..."
Princess Cadance,[through microphone] The next host of the Equestria Games is... the Crystal Empire!
Rainbow Dash,We did it!
Princess Cadance,"[through microphone] Congratulations, Crystal Ponies!"
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] You know, it feels good to help others get something you always wanted but never had. Almost as good as getting it yourself. Almost."
Twilight Sparkle,We'll still be able to come back here and watch the games when they're played.
Rainbow Dash,You're right. That'll rock!
Fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness."
Conductor,All aboard!
Rainbow Dash,"Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home.
Applejack,Think he's still got a handle on things?
Twilight Sparkle,"[breathes out] If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader."
Applejack,You all hear that?
Twilight Sparkle,Morning in Ponyville shimmers Morning in Ponyville shines And I know for absolute certain That everything is certainly fine
Others,There's the Mayor en route to her office There's the sofa clerk selling some quills
Davenport,"Morning, kid!"
Twilight Sparkle,My Ponyville is so gentle and still Can things ever go wrong? I don't think that they will
Others,Morning in Ponyville shimmers Morning in Ponyville shines And I know for absolute certain That everything is certainly<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, that's not funny!"
Rarity,"Terribly sorry, darling. I'm afraid I'm... I'm not good with the thundery ones."
Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] Something tells me everything is not going to be fine.
Twilight Sparkle,What are you doing? What happened to your cutie mark?
Rarity,"Whatever do you mean, Twilight? I'm simply doing what I've done since the day it first appeared. Does my sky look fabulous or what?"
Rarity,Too last season?
Twilight Sparkle,Where is Rainbow Dash? Why isn't she handling this?
Spike,[yawns] I still don't know what you had to wake me up for. I love sleeping in the rain.
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, guys."
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash! Why is Rarity doing your job?
Twilight Sparkle,And what in Equestria is going on in... here?
Rainbow Dash,"These animals don't listen, no, not one little bit They run around out of control and throw their hissy fits [cat hissing] It's up to me to stop them, 'cause plainly you can see It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me"
Fluttershy,"[blows balloon] I try to keep them laughing, put a smile upon their face But no matter what I try, it seems a bit of a disgrace [blows party horn] [laughter] I have to entertain them, it's there for all to see It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me"
Pinkie Pie,"I don't care much for pickin' fruit and plowin' fields ain't such a hoot No matter what I try, I cannot fix this busted water chute! I've got so many chores to do, it's no fun being me But it has to be my destiny, 'cause it's what my cutie mark is telling me"
Applejack,"Lookie here at what I made, I think that it's a dress I know it doesn't look like much, I'm under some distress Could y'all give me a hand here and help me fix this mess? My destiny is not pretty, but it's what my cutie mark is tellin' me"
Rarity,"I'm in love with weather patterns, but the others have concerns For I just gave them frostbite over top of their sunburns I have to keep on trying, for everyone can see"
Rarity and Rainbow Dash,It's got to be
Fluttershy,It's got to be
Pinkie Pie,My destiny
Applejack,My destiny
Others,"[Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy] And it's what my cutie mark"
Pinkie Pie and Applejack,It's what my cutie mark
Others,"[Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack] Yes, it's what my cutie mark is telling me!"
Twilight Sparkle,"This is bad. This is very, very bad."
Spike,What's going on? Why is this happening?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Last night when you were taking one of your seven-hour bubble baths, I got a special delivery from the princess."
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Twilight Sparkle,"
Others,"The spell contained on the last page of this book is Star Swirl the Bearded's secret unfinished masterpiece. [gasps] Ooh! He was never able to get it right, and thus abandoned it. I believe you are the only pony who can understand and rewrite it. Princess Celestia"
Others,"From one to another, another to one. A mark of one's destiny singled out alone, fulfilled. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't even rhyme!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I cast the spell so I could find out what it was, but nothing seemed to happen. But now I know something did happen. The spell has changed the Elements of Harmony! That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong!"
Spike,So just cast a counter-spell to switch them back.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. There is no counter-spell!
Spike,Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when Discord was here?
Twilight Sparkle,"It's not their memories, Spike. It's their true selves that have been altered!"
Spike,Zecora's cure for the cutie pox?
Twilight Sparkle,That won't work either...
Spike,"Well [sighs], maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe our friends will grow to like their new lives."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, Spike. They're not who they are meant to be anymore. Their destinies are now changed, and it's all my fault."
Twilight Sparkle,I have to find a way To make this all okay I can't believe this small mistake Could've caused so much heartache
Others,"Oh why, oh why?"
Others,Losing promise I don't know what to do Seeking answers I fear I won't get through to you
Others,"Oh why, oh why?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike, what have I done?"
Spike,"Aw, come on, Twilight, you'll figure out a way to fix this. These are your friends."
Twilight Sparkle,"You're right, Spike. And they mean more to me than anything. My friends..."
Spike,Twilight? Are you alright?
Twilight Sparkle,I've got it! I know what to do!
Spike,You do?
Twilight Sparkle,"I may not be able to remind them of who they are, but I can show them what they mean to each other. They'll find the part of themselves that's been lost so they can help the friend they care about so much! Come on, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, wait!"
Fluttershy,"Oh... Hey, Twilight..."
Twilight Sparkle,Where are you going?
Fluttershy,"I'm moving back to Cloudsdale. I don't know what's wrong, but I can't seem to make anypony laugh."
Twilight Sparkle,"Before you go, I was wondering if you might be willing to help Rainbow Dash. She's really struggling with her animals."
Fluttershy,But... I don't really know anything about animals...
Twilight Sparkle,But you do know something about Rainbow Dash.
Fluttershy,"I... know that she's a true friend, and I'll do anything I can to help her."
Rainbow Dash,[muffled] Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,I'm in here! Help! I'm trapped!
Fluttershy,"Hurry, Twilight! Can't you do some sort of spell to get her out?"
Twilight Sparkle,"No. Fluttershy, you're the only one who can help! Rainbow Dash needs you!"
Fluttershy,"Um... Hello? Little... woodland creatures? I know that you're all very upset and feel like giving Rainbow Dash a hard time, but we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe... rest for a bit? Oh! Uh... look! Here's some nice, juicy leaves for you to munch on. And some crunchy, munchy acorns too. Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break and have a little snack?"
Fluttershy,"Aww, look at that. I guess you were all just cranky because you were hungry. Oh, you are very welcome, little friends."
Fluttershy,"Goodness, it's like I can understand them! I... I feel strange, like... like this is what I'm meant to do, like this is who I am! My destiny! Wha... what happened?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, look! Your cutie mark!"
Twilight Sparkle,"It worked! It worked! Oh, I'm so happy you're back to normal! Now we need your help!"
Others,"A true, true friend helps a friend in need A friend will be there to help them see"
Twilight and Fluttershy,"A true, true friend helps a friend in need To see the light that shines from a true, true friend"
Rainbow Dash,"Um, hello? Friend trapped inside, remember?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity needs your help She's trying hard, doing what she can"
Fluttershy,"Would you try, just give it a chance You might find that you'll start to understand"
Twilight and Fluttershy,"A true, true friend helps a friend in need A friend will be there to help you see A true, true friend helps a friend in need To see the light that shines from a true, true friend"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, what just happened?"
Twilight Sparkle,"There's no time to explain, but we need your help. Applejack's trying to make dresses!"
Rainbow Dash,Say no more!
Rainbow Dash,"Applejack needs your help She's trying hard, doing what she can Would you try, just give it a chance You might find that you'll start to understand"
Others,"[Twilight, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash] A true, true friend helps a friend in need A friend will be there to help them see A true, true friend helps a friend in need To see the light that shines from a true, true friend"
Rarity,"[gasps] Oh my, what a terrible dream I had. Or, maybe I'm still having it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, Pinkie Pie is about to lose the apple farm. We need Applejack's help!"
Rarity,"Lose the apple farm? Well we can't let that happen, now can we?"
Rarity,Pinkie Pie is in trouble We need to get there by her side We can try to do what we can now For together we can be her guide
Others,"[Twilight, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity] A true, true friend helps a friend in need A friend will be there to help them see A true, true friend helps a friend in need To see the light that shines from a true, true friend"
Applejack,Yee-haw! Now that's more like it! What's next?
Twilight Sparkle,The townspeople are furious. We need the old Pinkie Pie back.
Applejack,I'm on it. I know just the thing.
Applejack,"The townspeople need you They've been sad for a while They march around, face a-frown And never seem to smile And if you feel like helpin' We'd appreciate a lot If you'd get up there and spread some cheer From here to Canterlot"
Pinkie Pie,"Come on ponies, I wanna see you SMILE!"
Crowd,PINKIE!
Others,"[Main cast<U+00A0>and crowd] A true, true friend helps a friend in need A friend will be there to help them see A true, true friend helps a friend in need To see the light! (To see the light!) That shines! (That shines!) From a true, true friend!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[echoing] A mark of one's destiny, singled out alone, fulfilled. [normal] [gasps] Wait a second, that's it! I understand now! I know how to fix the spell!"
Others,"From all of us together, together we're friends. With the marks of our destinies made one, there is magic without end!"
Fluttershy,[gasps] What happened?
Twilight Sparkle,[echoing] Hello? Where am I? What is this place?
Princess Celestia,"[echoing] Congratulations, Twilight. I knew you could do it."
Twilight Sparkle,[echoing] Princess... I don't understand. What did I do?
Princess Celestia,"You did something today that's never been done before. Something even a great unicorn like Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like you do. The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville have taught you well. You have proven that you're ready, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,Ready? Ready for what?
Princess Celestia,"You've come such a long, long way And I've watched you from that very first day To see how you might grow To see what you might do To see what you've been through And all the ways you've made me proud of you"
Others,It's time now for a new change to come You've grown up and your new life has begun To go where you will go To see what you will see To find what you will be For it's time for you to fulfill your destiny
Applejack,Twilight? Is that you?
Applejack,Wha... I-I've never seen anything like it!
Rarity,"Why, you've become an Alicorn. I didn't even know that was possible."
Fluttershy,Wow... You look just like a princess!
Princess Celestia,That's because she is a princess.
Main cast,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,A... A princess?
Princess Celestia,"Since you've come to Ponyville, you've displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity, optimism, and of course, the leadership of a true princess."
Twilight Sparkle,But... does this mean I won't be your student anymore?
Princess Celestia,"Not in the same way as before. I'll still be here to help and guide you, but we're all your students now, too. You are an inspiration to us all, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,But... what do I do now? Is there a book about being a princess I should read?
Princess Celestia,[giggles] There will be time for all of that later.
Princess Celestia,"We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion. My most faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in Ponyville. She even helped reunite me with my sister, Princess Luna. But today, Twilight Sparkle did something extraordinary. She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned Equestria's newest princess. Fillies and gentlecolts, may I present for the very first time, Princess Twilight Sparkle!"
Choir,"The Princess Twilight cometh Behold, behold A Princess here before us Behold, behold, behold"
Others,"Behold, behold (behold, behold) The Princess Twilight cometh Behold, behold (behold, behold) The Princess is The Princess is here!"
Princess Celestia,"Say something, Princess."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh. Um... [clears throat] A little while ago, my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia sent me to live in Ponyville. She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful. Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends. Thank you, everypony!"
Shining Armor,Twilight! I'm so proud of you!
Twilight Sparkle,Are you crying?
Shining Armor,Of course not. It's... it's liquid pride. Totally different thing.
Applejack,"Way to go, Princess!"
Pinkie Pie,Best coronation day ever!
Fluttershy,"We love you, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"I love you too, girls!"
Twilight Sparkle,Life in Equestria shimmers Life in Equestria shines And I know for absolute certain
Main cast and crowd,"That everything (that everything) Yes, everything (yes, everything) Yes, everything is certainly fine It<U+0092>s fine"
Twilight Sparkle,Yes! Everything<U+0092>s going to be just fine!
Rainbow Dash,You gotta really flap 'em hard.
Twilight Sparkle,[grunts] Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, maybe not quite that hard."
Twilight Sparkle,Whoa! Oof!
Applejack,"Lookin' good up there, Princess Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, you know you don't have to call me that."
Rarity,Why do you protest so? You've already given up wearing your crown all the time. The least you can do is embrace your new title.
Twilight Sparkle,"If other ponies want to address me that way, I suppose it's fine, but... not my friends. It just doesn't feel right. [sigh] And neither does all this flying business. The Summer Sun Celebration is only two days away, and I'm never gonna be ready to perform my part."
Rainbow Dash,"Not if you spend all your time down here, you won't! Now get up there and show everypony the big finish!"
Pinkie Pie,Wow! That was a big finish!
Rarity,"You look amazing, darling. They've really captured your regality."
Twilight Sparkle,I suppose.
Rainbow Dash,I don't know if it's everypony's dream.
Pinkie Pie,Most of my dreams are about frosting! [slurp] Ohohohoho...
Fluttershy,We'd better get going. We don't want to miss our train.
Applejack,"Fluttershy's right. Don't know about y'all, but I've still got bushels to do to get ready. The official celebration may be here in Canterlot, but hoo-wee, has the Mayor put us in charge of one heck of a party back home. Aw, don't look like that, sugarcube. You get to be right there with the other Princesses when Celestia raises the sun."
Twilight Sparkle,"And I'm honored. Really, I am. It's just that the Summer Sun Celebration is what first brought us all together. It just doesn't feel right not getting to spend such a special day with my Ponyville friends."
Rarity,"It doesn't feel right to us either, darling. If the Mayor wasn't so desperate for our assistance, we'd most certainly stay here in Canterlot. And of course we do understand that your royal duties must come first."
Applejack,"The Summer Sun Celebration may have brought us together, but it's something much bigger that'll always keep us connected. Exhibit A: The six of us are united by the Elements of Harmony. No amount of royal duties is gonna change that. Right, everypony?"
Applejack,"Right, Pinkie Pie?"
Fluttershy,You should take that as a yes.
Pinkie Pie,"We're gonna write you and give you so many details, it'll be like you're in Ponyville with us! Right, girls?"
Others,"Applejack, Fluttershy, Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye."
Rarity,And you will be with us right after the Celebration. We already have an appointment on the books to discuss the royal upgrades to your loft decor.
Train Conductor,All aboard for Ponyville!
Pinkie Pie,Whee!
Twilight Sparkle,"[exhales] I can't help it, Spike. They've only been gone a minute, and I already feel like I'm missing something."
Messenger Pony,For the Princess.
Spike,"[reading] Dear Twilight, you aren't missing anything. Your friend, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,[in the distance] That's me!
Twilight Sparkle,But I am. I just know it.
Spike,"Check, check, check, check, and... check! Huh, whaddaya know? We're way ahead of schedule! I credit your extremely competent assistant."
Twilight Sparkle,So do I.
Spike,The Celebration isn't until the day after tomorrow. We could still fit in a quick trip to Ponyville and be back in plenty of time to finish off these last few things before the main event!
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] That would be nice, Spike, but what if something else came up while we were gone? What if we were delayed getting back and I wasn't able to finish everything on that list? What if we lost the list on the way to Ponyville and then couldn't remember which things we'd done and which things we hadn't done, and then spent so much time trying to figure out what we hadn't done and what we had done, and we ruined the entire Celebration by not doing the one really important thing that we were supposed to do?!"
Spike,Uh... so that's a 'no' then?
Twilight Sparkle,These are the first royal duties Princess Celestia has given me. I can't risk letting her down!
Princess Celestia,And I'm sure you won't.
Spike,Your highness!
Princess Celestia,"No need for that now, Princess Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,Sorry.
Princess Celestia,[giggles] No need to apologize.
Twilight Sparkle,Sorry!
Princess Celestia,I must admit that it is wonderful to actually be looking forward to the Summer Sun Celebration.
Twilight Sparkle,What do you mean?
Princess Celestia,"For my subjects, it has always been a celebration of my defeat of Nightmare Moon. But for me... [sighs] It was just a terrible reminder that I'd had to banish my own sister."
Twilight Sparkle,I guess I never really thought about it that way.
Princess Celestia,"But now it has become a wonderful reminder of her transformation back into Princess Luna, and our happy reunion. I am so pleased that you will be playing a role in the festivities. I know it must have been difficult to see your friends return to Ponyville without you."
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe a little.
Princess Celestia,"You may no longer be my student, Princess Twilight, but I hope you know that I will always be here if you need me. Just as I hope that you will always be there when I need you."
Spike,[clears throat] I think this guy needs you?
Messenger Pony,"Uh, a message for Princess Twilight."
Princess Celestia,"A letter from Ponyville, I presume?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Never mind. It's not important. Spike, where were we?"
Spike,About to call it a night?
Twilight Sparkle,We should probably go over the checklist one more time.
Spike,I knew you were gonna say that...
Princess Celestia,I'll leave you to it.
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?! Spike?
Spike,[snores] Check-check-check-check-check-check...
Twilight Sparkle,Spike!
Spike,Ungh... What time is it?
Twilight Sparkle,It's the middle of the night! But it could be morning. That's just it! I can't tell!
Spike,Whoa. That is weird.
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, Spike, we have to find out what's going on."
Others,"""Primrose"": What do you think it means?!"
Royal Ribbon,Princess Twilight will know!
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm-I'm sure it's just... Well, there's certainly a logical ex<U+0096>"
Others,"Royal guard # Your Highness, you must come with us."
Others,Royal guard # It's Princess Luna and Princess Celestia.
Others,Royal guard # They're gone!
Twilight Sparkle,But I don't understand! Where are they?
Others,Royal guard # We don't know. It seems that Princess Celestia and Princess Luna have simply... vanished.
Spike,Vanished?!
Others,Royal guard # This is why we have come to you.
Others,Royal guard # We await your command.
Twilight Sparkle,My command?!
Others,"Royal guard # We're officers of the Royal Guard. We take our orders from royalty. With Princess Luna and Princess Celestia gone, and Princess Cadance overseeing the Crystal Empire now, that means we take our orders from you."
Others,"Royal guard # Princess Twilight, there's no time to waste. We need to know what you want us to do."
Spike,"Way to take charge, Twilight."
Others,Royal guard # Your highness! News from Ponyville! The Everfree Forest appears to be... well... invading!
Fluttershy,"Excuse me... Oh, pardon me... Are you all right? My goodness, what is it that has caused you all such distress?"
Fluttershy,"Whatever it is, I'm sure it's nothing you need to really worry about. [screams] Oh, no, you were right. You should be worried! Very, very worried!"
Big McIntosh,...Nope.
Applejack,"[straining] Dagnabbit, we ain't never seen this kind of trouble with weeds before. Now that I think about it, I've never seen these kinds of weeds at all! Have y'all?"
Big McIntosh,Nope.
Applejack,Where the heck are these things comin' from? And what in tarnation is goin' on with the sky?!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, no, you don't! This is Ponyville territory, and we aren't due for rain until after the Summer Sun Celebration. You Everfree clouds need to just head on back to where you belong! Whoa! [yelps] Gonna make me do this the hard way, huh? [yelping] Hey!"
Rarity,[humming] Hmm. Something strange about the sky.
Rarity,What in the name of calming chamomile is going on?!
Rarity,"Opalescence, darling, I'm so sorry! I promise I am not doing this on purpose!"
Rarity,"It wasn't me, I swear!"
Rarity,"Ooh, Sweetie Belle! If this is some sort of prank you and your little Crusader friends are pulling, I find very little humor in it!"
Sweetie Belle,"Rarity, you have to help me! I think something's wrong with my horn!"
Spike,Where are we going?!
Twilight Sparkle,"The Everfree Forest is... 'invading'. Whatever is going on, I'm sure we're going to need our friends and the Elements of Harmony to stop it! I just hope we haven't missed the train..."
Spike,"[gasps] [short on breath] Twilight? There is another way for us to get to Ponyville, remember?"
Twilight Sparkle,There is?
Spike,Huah! You can fly!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. Right!
Twilight Sparkle,Whoa!
Rarity,"Something very strange is going on, and- [gasps] I for one would appreciate an explanation!"
Rainbow Dash,"All I know is the sky's split in two, and these clouds moving in sure aren't from around here."
Applejack,"Neither are all these crazy plants! They're comin' from the Everfree Forest! And try as we might, us Earth ponies can't do anythin' to get rid of 'em! Don't suppose you know any magic that might stop 'em from spreadin'?"
Rarity,"Alas, this whole raging forest situation seems to have left my horn on the fritz!"
Fluttershy,We have to figure out something! I don't know how much more of this Ponyville can take! [yelps] I don't know how much more I can take!
Applejack,"The forest is expandin', y'all, and judgin' by how fast it's movin', it doesn't seem content just takin' over Ponyville... I reckon before long, it'll cover half of Equestria!"
Spike,I'm starting to wish... we'd taken the train!
Twilight Sparkle,"Almost there! Come on, Spike, we need to get the Elements of Harmony and find the others!"
Spike,Incoming!
Twilight Sparkle,Whoa! Aah!
Rarity,"Oh, thank goodness!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, I hope you know we wouldn't normally go through your books without permission..."
Spike,"Sweet ground! [kissing noises] Sweet, sweet, wonderful ground!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, I get it! I need to work on my flying!"
Pinkie Pie,"I dunno if you've noticed, but the Everfree Forest is just a teeny-tiny bit out of control."
Applejack,Guess it turned out you were missin' something here in Ponyville after all.
Rarity,But perhaps you already know what's causing all of this calamity. Has Princess Celestia sent you to dispel it posthaste?
Twilight Sparkle,"Not exactly. You see, Princess Celestia is, well... she and Princess Luna are both..."
Spike,They're missing!
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know who has taken them, but I've got a hunch we're going to need the Elements of Harmony to get them back."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, yeah, just like old times."
Pinkie Pie,A-boo-yah!
Applejack,I told ya we'd always be connected by the Elements. [sighs] Now we just gotta figure out who to aim these bad boys at so we can get Celestia and Luna back and keep the rest of Equestria from becoming plant food! Any ideas?
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm...
Pinkie Pie,I haven't found squat in any of the books I've been looking through! Oopsies! Missed a spot!
Twilight Sparkle,"Half day, half night... strange weather patterns... out of control plants. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against."
Discord,"[singing] Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap-ooh! [laughs] Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower."
Twilight Sparkle,"E-nough! Release Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, and stop the Everfree Forest from invading!"
Discord,"Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?"
Applejack,"Don't you play dumb with us, Discord! We know you're the one behind all of this!"
Discord,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember?"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, right! This has got your cloven hoofprints all over it!"
Discord,I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends.
Pinkie Pie,"Drop the act, buster! We're onto you!"
Discord,"Ladies, ladies, I'm innocent. Would I lie to you?"
Main cast sans Fluttershy,Yes!
Fluttershy,"Um, maybe?"
Discord,"Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it."
Rainbow Dash,I say we blast him back to stone!
Applejack,Works for me!
Rarity,"Hear, hear!"
Fluttershy,Hey! We can't do that! What if he really is telling the truth?
Discord,"Well, finally! Somepony willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend Shutterfly here."
Fluttershy,"Um, it's Fluttershy."
Discord,"Oh, right, whatever."
Twilight Sparkle,"If you're not the one responsible, then help us figure out who is!"
Discord,"I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it."
Twilight Sparkle,Rrrgh!
Discord,Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?
Twilight Sparkle,Zecora!
Zecora,"From my home, I have had to flee! The forest has grown too wild, even for me!"
Applejack,Any idea why all this is happenin'?
Zecora,"I'm afraid it is a mystery to me as well, but I may have something that, if combined with a spell... I do not dare to use it myself, the results would be tragic. It only responds to Alicorn magic. Princess Twilight, you can turn the potion from purple to white. After a sip, you may see why the sky is day and night."
Pinkie Pie,Oooh!
Twilight Sparkle,[drinking] Doesn't seem to be worki-
Twilight Sparkle,Where am I?
Princess Luna,Not... another step!
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Luna! I don't understand. Where are we? Why did you and Celestia disappear?
Princess Luna,Did you really expect me to sit idly by while they all basked in your precious light?
Twilight Sparkle,Precious light?
Princess Luna,There can only be one princess in Equestria! And that princess... will be me!
Royal Guard,It's Princess Luna and Princess Celestia.
Spike,They're missing!
Twilight Sparkle,The Everfree Forest is... invading. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against.
Discord,I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?
Zecora,You can turn the potion from purple to white. You may see why the sky is day and night.
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Luna!
Princess Luna,There can only be one princess in Equestria! And that princess will be me!
Twilight Sparkle,Luna! Think of how long you were banished to the moon! You'll give us no choice but to send you back there if you don't stop!
Princess Celestia,"Luna, I will not fight you! You must lower the moon! It is your duty!"
Nightmare Moon,Luna? I am... Nightmare Moon! I have but one royal duty now: to destroy you! And where do you think you're going?
Twilight Sparkle,Celestia!
Twilight Sparkle,No... Why would Luna do this? Why now? [crying] You're all right. You're all right! Princess Celestia?
Princess Celestia,"Oh, dear sister. I am sorry, but you have given me no choice but to use these."
Twilight Sparkle,Are those the Elements of Harmony? But that's how they looked in... the past. This is the night you banished her.
Nightmare Moon,Nooooooo!
Twilight Sparkle,Why are you all looking at me like that?
Applejack,It's just... you were mumblin' to yourself...
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! And don't forget the uncontrollable sobbing!
Fluttershy,We were really worried about you.
Discord,"I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road."
Rainbow Dash,Did you find out whose rump we need to kick and where we can find them?
Twilight Sparkle,I saw something from a long time ago. But it didn't explain what's happening now.
Zecora,Perhaps farther back still are the answers you seek. Another sip of the potion will give you a peek.
Spike,You sure about this?
Discord,"Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!"
Discord,"Oh, this is so much fun. How about a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Pony'?"
Princess Celestia,"[gasp] Play time is over for you, Discord."
Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there?"
Princess Celestia,The Elements of Harmony.
Princess Luna,"With them, we shall defeat you."
Twilight Sparkle,This must be when they turned Discord into stone.
Discord,[laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!
Princess Luna,[gasp] The Tree of Harmony.
Twilight Sparkle,The Tree of Harmony? My cutie mark.
Princess Luna,Are you sure?
Princess Celestia,"We have managed to discover the only means by which we can defeat Discord and free the citizens of Equestria. Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here."
Spike,So what did you find out?
Twilight Sparkle,"I still don't know what's happened to Princess Luna and Princess Celestia, but I think I know why the Everfree Forest is acting this way. Something's happened to the Tree of Harmony."
Rainbow Dash,The tree of what now?
Twilight Sparkle,It's where Princess Celestia and Princess Luna found the Elements. I think it's in danger.
Applejack,"Well, all right then! Let's go save a... tree. Uh... where is it exactly?"
Twilight Sparkle,I think it's in... there.
Discord,Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn!
Rarity,Seems like only yesterday we were heading into these woods to find the Elements of Harmony.
Twilight Sparkle,"Seems like only yesterday I was foolish enough to think I should go after them on my own. I don't know what we're going to face in there. But whatever it is, I know we need to face it together."
Rarity,[gasps] A cragadile! Run for your lives!
Twilight Sparkle,That was close.
Applejack,"[sighs] A little too close, if you ask me. You sure you're all right?"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm fine. I just can't seem to get these new wings to do what I want them to do when I want them to do it.
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, you'll figure it out eventually."
Twilight Sparkle,"""Eventually"" isn't soon enough."
Applejack,"You have been having an awful lot of trouble with those things. And, well, who knows what else is gonna to come after us? You know, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea for Twilight to go back to Ponyville and let us look for the Tree of Harmony without her."
Twilight Sparkle,What? Why?
Applejack,"For starters, you just about got eaten by a cragadilly."
Twilight Sparkle,We all did. He wasn't after just me.
Applejack,"Sure, but... well, the rest of us aren't princesses."
Twilight Sparkle,What's that got to do with anything?
Applejack,"Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are gone. If something happened to you, I-I just don't think Equestria can risk losing another princess."
Rarity,"Applejack does make a valid point. Even if we manage to save the Tree of Harmony, it won't necessarily mean Princess Celestia and Princess Luna will return. Equestria will need somepony to lead in their absence."
Twilight Sparkle,But the Tree of Harmony! I'm the only one who has seen it and knows what it looks like.
Rainbow Dash,"Huge tree, cutie marks on the trunk, probably being attacked by something hideously awful? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we'll know it when we see it."
Twilight Sparkle,All of you feel this way? Feel like I shouldn't be here?
Fluttershy,It is probably for the best.
Cherry Berry and Comet Tail,Help! Help!
Twilight Sparkle,Discord!
Discord,You're welcome! Hmph. No luck finding your tree?
Twilight Sparkle,We ran into some trouble. And my friends decided it would be best if I returned to Ponyville while they continue the search. Equestria will need me if Princess Celestia and Princess Luna don't return.
Discord,I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.
Twilight Sparkle,I don't think I'm better than anypony!
Twilight Sparkle,I never should have agreed to come back here.
Spike,"Come on, Twilight. Discord may be reformed, but he's not that reformed. He's just trying to get under your skin."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, it's working!"
Rainbow Dash,Anypony else starting to think this is a lost cause? We're almost at Celestia and Luna's old castle. Maybe whatever Twilight saw when she took that crazy potion wasn't real. Maybe there is no Tree of Harmony. Maybe<U+0096>
Applejack,Maybe it's right down there.
Rainbow Dash,[gasp] It can't be!
Rarity,How are we supposed to get to it?
Pinkie Pie,"Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Take the stairs, silly!"
Spike,Are we there yet?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know where we are. We're lost. I never should have left my friends.
Spike,"We can't just give up. Maybe if I get up there, I'll be able to spot 'em. Well, what do you know? Twilight?"
Fluttershy,[gasp] I think it's dying!
Rainbow Dash,Nice try. Heh- Whoa! Oof!
Rarity,"Valiant efforts on both your parts, but the tree remains in jeopardy."
Applejack,And I suppose you've got a better idea? That's what I thought.
Fluttershy,I know who would know what to do. But we sent her home.
Rainbow Dash,"It was your idea, Applejack!"
Applejack,"We all agreed it was the best thing, Rainbow Dash! We were tryin' to protect her."
Spike,Oof! Ow! Ugh!
Spike,Twilight! Trouble! Help!
Applejack,"Listen here, you rabid rhododendrons! You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!"
Rainbow Dash,Up here!
Pinkie Pie,Yoo-hoo! Come and get me!
Rarity,Don't forget about me!
Pinkie Pie,Ta-da!
Applejack,I sure am glad you came looking for us.
Twilight Sparkle,Not as glad as I am that you found me.
Rarity,"The truth of it is, Twilight, we're simply lost without you."
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. Equestria may need its princess...
Fluttershy,... But we need our friend.
Princess Celestia,"[voice over] Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here."
Twilight Sparkle,I know how we can save the tree. We have to give it the Elements of Harmony.
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, heh. How are we supposed to protect Equestria?"
Rarity,How are we meant to rein Discord in if we can't use the Elements to turn him back to stone?
Applejack,Twilight... The Elements of Harmony... They're what keep us connected no matter what.
Twilight Sparkle,"You're right about one thing, Applejack. The Elements of Harmony did bring us together. But it isn't the Elements that will keep us connected. It's our friendship. And it's more important and more powerful than any magic. My new role in Equestria may mean I have to take on new responsibilities, and our friendships may be tested, but it will never, ever be broken. There's no time to lose. Everypony ready?"
Discord,"[thud] Oh, poo."
Princess Celestia,We know how difficult it must have been for you to give up the Elements. It took great courage to relinquish them.
Twilight Sparkle,What's inside it? How am I supposed to open it?
Princess Luna,"Six locks, six keys."
Princess Celestia,I do not know where they are. But I do know that it is a mystery you will not be solving alone.
Discord,"Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?"
Applejack,[sigh] Gone.
Discord,Gone? Gone?
Fluttershy,"But our friendship remains. And if you want to remain friends, you'll stop thinking whatever it is you're thinking and help us clean up."
Discord,Fine. But I don't do windows.
Applejack,One thing I don't get. Why did all this happen now?
Discord,I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.
Twilight Sparkle,What did you say?!
Discord,"Oh, why should I try to explain it when you can see for yourself?"
Princess Celestia,"Play time is over for you, Discord!"
Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is."
Twilight Sparkle,You realize this is information we could have used hours ago?!
Discord,And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?
Princess Celestia,"Citizens of Equestria, it is no longer with a heavy heart but with great joy that I raise the summer sun. For this celebration now represents not the defeat of Nightmare Moon, but the return of my sister, Princess Luna."
Spike,"What's wrong, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, I've gone through every book in Ponyville, Spike, and there isn't a single mention of the mysterious chest that came from the Tree of Harmony, nor anything about keys to unlock it! But something tells me that opening it is pretty important. I hope Princess Celestia has some ideas. If the library in Canterlot doesn't have anything, I-I don't know where else to look!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] My dearest Twilight, while it would be perfectly lovely to have you in Canterlot once more, I have another option in mind much closer to Ponyville."
Princess Celestia,"[voice over] As you know, the ancient castle that I once shared with Princess Luna lies mostly in ruins, deep in the Everfree Forest. But if you look carefully, you may find a book that could prove helpful to your research, hidden somewhere in what's left of the castle library."
Twilight Sparkle,[happy gasp] Wow! Look at all these ancient books! It's a veritable goldmine of information! I can't believe it! Woo-hoo!
Spike,"Whoa, whoa-whoa! Oof! [yelp] Uh, heh-heh. So, uh, Twilight. Uh, ready to head home?"
Twilight Sparkle,Are you kidding? This place is perfect!
Rainbow Dash,I'm not gonna move. You move.
Applejack,Uh-uh. There is no way I'm movin'.
Pinkie Pie,This is the most daring dare anypony ever dared dare another pony to dare!
Rainbow Dash and Applejack,Huh?
Pinkie Pie,It's exciting!
Parcel Post,"Uh, whatcha'll doing?"
Pinkie Pie,"Rainbow Dash and Applejack are competing for the title of ""Most Daring Pony""! This is the final test: the Bee Stare! Last pony to blink wins!"
Parcel Post,... I'm gonna need my bees back.
Rainbow Dash,But then we'll never find out who the Most Daring Pony is!
Applejack,"Well, what do we do now?"
Pinkie Pie,"Don't worry, ladies, I've been keeping excellent score all day! [quietly] Hmm, move the decimal, carry the 2, and... [aloud] Congratulations! You're tied!"
Applejack,Tied?
Rainbow Dash,You can't be tied for the Most Daring Pony!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, no problem. We just have to come up with another daring dare."
Applejack,Right. I think I might have an idea of what we can do.
Fluttershy,"Um, Rarity? Don't you think it's a little late in the day to be walking through the forest? It is... star-spider season, after all. Though, I'm sure you have a very good reason."
Rarity,Simply the most important reason I've ever had in my entire life!
Fluttershy,"Oh, well then I'm happy to help. What is it?"
Rarity,"I've heard rumors that the Castle of the Two Sisters is filled with the most gorgeous of ancient tapestries in all of pony history! It pains me to think of those magnificent creations rotting away in those old ruins, totally unappreciated."
Fluttershy,I see...
Rarity,I require your help in borrowing one or two to bring back to the boutique where I can restore them. Maybe I'll even use the patterns as the inspiration for a new line!
Fluttershy,That does sound... very important.
Fluttershy,"Um, are you sure you need those tapestries?"
Rarity,"But, of course. Although, I must admit these ruins are a fright. Just look at all the dirt everywhere! Ugh..."
Fluttershy,[gasp] Angel!
Fluttershy,"Angel! Oh, you really shouldn't have run off like that. Ancient ruins are filled with all sorts of things that can hurt you! You could stub your toe, or, or trip on a loose stone... You have to be careful!"
Spike,"I don't think I'll need all these candles, Twilight. I was really only scared for a second."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, these aren't for you, Spike. We're gonna be studying late into the night, and we're gonna need all the light we can get."
Spike,"Oh, great."
Applejack,"Well, here we are!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, what's so daring about this place? This is where we got the Elements of Harmony."
Applejack,"When I was just a filly, Granny Smith told me of an ancient legend. When Nightmare Moon was banished, not every last bit of her dark magic went with her. Granny used to say, when night falls on the castle, that magic takes the form of... the Pony of Shadows!"
Rainbow Dash,"You mean, like a ghost?"
Applejack,[spookily] Nopony knows!
Rainbow Dash,Ugh.
Rarity,[excited gasp] This one is perfect!
Fluttershy,"Well, it certainly could use some restoration."
Rarity,"Be a dear, fly up there and lift it off that hook?"
Rarity,[calling out] Maybe from below?
Rainbow Dash,"I don't see what's so daring about an old legend. Plus, I don't believe in ghosts."
Applejack,You might wanna rethink your position on that.
Applejack,"You saw that, right?"
Rainbow Dash,Run!
Fluttershy,Ow... I think I hurt my wing.
Rarity,"Oh, my dear, I am so sorry! That tapestry is far too heavy. We'll just have to find a smaller one."
Fluttershy,"Oh, of course."
Rarity,"Where, pray tell, did you disappear to?"
Fluttershy,What do you mean?
Rarity,"While you were struggling under that fabric, the entire wall spun around! You must have activated a secret door."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Rarity,I suppose these ruins are chock full of them.
Fluttershy,Really?
Rarity,Absolutely. We must use the utmost care as we<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"[panting] Okay, so, maybe the legend is true!"
Applejack,"Well, that's why I brought you here! I guess only the most daring pony of all could stay in this castle all night without being scared off."
Rainbow Dash,Scared? I'm not scared!
Applejack,"Well, m-me neither!"
Rainbow Dash,Then it's settled! Whoever stays in the castle the longest is the Most Daring Pony.
Applejack,Deal.
Rainbow Dash,But it's gonna take a lot more than some shadowy ghost pony to get me to leave.
Applejack,Me too! Humph!
Twilight Sparkle,"Find anything, Spike?"
Spike,"Uh, nope. Nothing yet."
Spike,Aaah!
Twilight Sparkle,Angel? What are you doing here?
Twilight Sparkle,[gasp] Whoa! [reading] The Journal of the Two Sisters. [gasp] Maybe this is the book Princess Celestia was talking about!
Rainbow Dash,"I sure hope you're not afraid of the dark, Applejack!"
Applejack,"I can't say that I am! But even if I was, I'd be at least fifty percent less scared of it than you, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,I dunno how all that math works because I'm not scared at all!
Applejack,Me neither!
Applejack,Huh?
Rainbow Dash,W-what's the matter? It's just a dark hallway full of... disembodied pony legs.
Applejack,Yeah. Nothin'... creepy about that.
Rarity,I'm starting to wonder if maybe this castle doesn't want my expertise!
Fluttershy,"Oh dear. Angel? Rarity, have you seen him?"
Rarity,"I'm not sure he made the trip down with us, dear."
Fluttershy,"Oh, goodness! We have to find him. An ancient castle is no place for a bunny. He could get hit by falling debris, or the floor could give out under him! Oh! He could be trapped in a dark place with no way out!"
Rarity,[flatly] I can only imagine how that might feel. Hmm...
Rainbow Dash,"Applejack, if you're scared, you can just admit it. You don't need to put your hoof around me."
Applejack,"Uh, I'm over here."
Fluttershy,Rarity! What is it?
Rarity,I felt something... alive!
Fluttershy,[gasp] Angel!
Fluttershy,"But we can't leave now, not with Angel lost somewhere in this dangerous old castle! He could be trapped under a crumbling statue, or stuck high in a tower without food or water or any friends at all!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, you've got to hear this. [reading] I love to duck behind the paintings, and though the Hall of Hooves still gives her a bit of a fright, the trap door slide is Luna's favorite."
Spike,"""Hall of Hooves""?"
Twilight Sparkle,[reading] Soon the Organ to the Outside will be finished. I can hardly wait.
Spike,"What's the ""Organ to the Outside""?"
Twilight Sparkle,[happily] I have no idea!
Applejack,You hear that?
Rainbow Dash,"You mean, the creepy sound of a haunted pipe organ?"
Applejack,Uh... maybe?
Rainbow Dash,[worried] I don't know what you're talking about!
Spike,"Uh, Twilight? Did you hear something?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike. Quit being such a scaredy-dragon. This castle is thousands of years old, and half of it was destroyed by Nightmare Moon. Of course it makes strange sounds. It's practically falling apart!"
Spike,Oh... kay.
Fluttershy,[calling] Angel! Angel!
Rarity,I'm sure we'll find him.
Fluttershy,Angel?
Fluttershy,Did you find Angel? Is he okay?
Rarity,[gasp] They are perfect! No castle in its right mind could possibly object to my restoring such exquisite works of art.
Fluttershy,"Oh! They're lovely, Rarity, but... I have to keep looking for Angel. Oh, I hope he doesn't think I've given up on him."
Rarity,I'm right behind you! Won't... [grunts] be... [grunts] a moment!
Applejack,Do you think there's a single room in this castle that isn't filled with terrifying things?
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! [nervous laughter] It's just old pony armor. What's the big deal?
Applejack,Yeah! It's not like it's gonna come to life or anything. Right?
Applejack,Huh?!
Applejack,Whoa-oa!
Rarity,"[groans, spits] Now, you look here, castle! You are very old and very scary! But your wall art is in an atrocious state!"
Rarity,And there is nothing you can do to keep me from my sacred task of restoration!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh... Applejack? If you went back to Ponyville, that means I win, right?"
Fluttershy,"[calling] Rarity! I know hiding isn't really your sense of humor, but please let this be a joke!"
Applejack,"[screams] [echoing] Rainbow? Hello? I guess if I don't find you, I win by default, right?"
Rarity,"[grunts] [grumbles] Of all the castles in Equestria, this is by far the most ungrateful!"
Rarity,Oof!
Fluttershy,[whispered yelling] Angel! Rarity! Oh... I hope you two are together.
Rainbow Dash,"Haunted statues, creepy armor... Come on, castle! Is that all you got?"
Fluttershy,[whimpering] [gasp] Angel?
Fluttershy,AAANGEEEEEL!!!
Twilight Sparkle,What in the world is that?!
Spike,"Oh, you know. Probably just more strange sounds of this old castle falling apart!"
Twilight Sparkle,"No one likes sarcasm, Spike."
Spike,What got into them?
Fluttershy,"[grunting] It's okay, Angel! You're okay! You're okay!"
Applejack,Yaaaaah! Shadows everywhere!
Fluttershy,[sobbing] Aaangeeeeel!
Twilight Sparkle,"Alright, everypony, stop!"
Applejack,Twilight?
Fluttershy,Must... save... Ange<U+0097>! ...Oh.
Rainbow Dash,Fluttershy? What are you doing here?
Rarity,She's with me...
Rarity,[gasps] Thank you.
Twilight Sparkle,"Have you all spent the whole night running around, scaring each other?"
Applejack,"Well, that depends."
Twilight Sparkle,On what?
Rainbow Dash,On whether or not you're the Pony of Shadows.
Spike,What's... the Pony of Shadows?
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, that's just an old ponies' tale."
Spike,Then who's playing... that?
Twilight Sparkle,We're going to find out.
Twilight Sparkle,[whispered] The Pony of Shadows!
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, you guys! Did you know I can totally play the organ? Because I didn't!"
All,Pinkie?!
Pinkie Pie,Check it out!
Rainbow Dash,You're the Pony of Shadows?
Pinkie Pie,[continues playing light melody] The pony of what?
Twilight Sparkle,See? What'd I tell ya?
Applejack,I thought you went to ring the school bell all week!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, yeah! I only had to ring it for, like, five minutes! They said that was good enough! Eh, can't imagine why..."
Pinkie Pie,"So then, I decided to throw a ""finish ringing the school bell"" party! But I didn't have any bluebells, and you can't throw a ""finish ringing the school bell"" party without bluebells, so I went to Everfree Forest to pick some, but it started to get so chilly."
Pinkie Pie,"I had to wrap myself up in the tarp I was gonna use to gather flowers, and then I saw Fluttershy and Rarity. But they went into the castle before I could invite them to my party. Luckily, I followed them inside so I could help you all with your party!"
Rarity,What party is that?
Pinkie Pie,Duh!
Rarity,"I swear, this is going right back where I found it just as soon as I've returned it to its former glory."
Fluttershy,"Now don't go running off again! Oh, I can't believe I was so frightened. Guess I let my imagination get the best of me."
Applejack,I think we all did.
Pinkie Pie,I always let my imagination run away from me! Then it comes back... with cake!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, it's good to know that whenever your imagination is getting away from you, a good friend can help you rein it in. And even though I didn't find anything out about the mysterious chest, I'm glad I was here to help all of you."
Rarity,"You certainly did that, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! Why weren't you scared?
Twilight Sparkle,"Reading Celestia's diary made it hard to be afraid, because I knew what it was like when she and Luna lived here. Knowing something about the past made it easier to deal with my problems in the present, even the scary ones."
Twilight Sparkle,"I've just thought of a great idea! Why don't we keep a journal, just like the royal pony sisters?"
Fluttershy,All of us?
Twilight Sparkle,"Sure! That way we can learn from each other! And maybe some day, other ponies will read it and learn something, too!"
Rarity,What a splendid idea!
Applejack,"I know what my first entry will be! ""Dear Diary, I'm glad Granny Smith's legend wasn't true."""
Rainbow Dash,Me too!
Pinkie Pie,Me three! Because that means you two are still tied for Most Daring Pony!
Spike,"Heh, Shadow Ponies... How ridiculous is that?"
Rainbow Dash,"Four more months, four more months, four more months! I bet you're excited, huh?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, my. I, uh, I could be excited. I don't really know. I wasn't really think<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, you gotta be excited!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, well, I guess maybe I'm a little kinda sort of excited."
Rainbow Dash,I thought so!
Fluttershy,"Yeah... So, um, why am I excited?"
Rainbow Dash,"Because the next Daring Do book is coming out exactly four months from today! That's how exciting it is! So what amazing, incredible, awesome adventure do you think Daring Do will have in her next book, huh?"
Rainbow Dash,"[voice over] Will she at long last stalk the Fortress of Talacon? Only to be forced to contend with its dreaded and impenetrable arrow defense? And if so, could her skill, quick wits, and courage possibly carry the day? Or will her next adventure bring her face to face with the vast and horrible Ahuizotl himself?!"
Rainbow Dash,"Would she cower, turn tail and run? Or would she fly at him, full bore, knowing full well against all odds that the greatest challenge she ever faced was still surely no match for<U+0097>"
Others,Ahuizotl [with Fluttershy's voice]: [gasps] Look out!
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm not so sure she's gonna last another four months..."
Rainbow Dash,"Three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days! Heya, Twilight! Aren't you excited that<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,So glad you've finally made it!
Rainbow Dash,What's everypony doing here?
Rainbow Dash,So what holiday would today be?
Pinkie Pie,National Random Holiday Party Day! Woo-hoo!
Rarity,I've never heard of it either. [sips] But the punch is quite tasty.
Rainbow Dash,How come nopony bothered to invite me?
Applejack,"I came to invite you personally, but it seems you were a speck too busy reading the last Daring Do book for the twelfth time."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, well, in three months and twenty six more days, I'll be able to read the next one."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, haven't you heard? The release of the next book got pushed another two months."
Rainbow Dash,[spit-take] Two more months?! I've been waiting so long already! I don't think I can take another two months! I'll never make it!
Fluttershy,Yeah. I can vouch for that...
Rainbow Dash,Did they give a reason?
Twilight Sparkle,The publisher just said author A.K. Yearling won't be able to finish the book for another two months. Cupcakes?
Rainbow Dash,[growls] How could you possibly know that before me? I'm the series' biggest fan!
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm just as big a fan as you! In fact, I'm the one who first introduced you to the books, remember?"
Rainbow Dash,Oh. Right.
Twilight Sparkle,"A.K. Yearling just might be my favorite author. I know everything about her. Where she grew up, where she studied literature, where she wrote the first Daring Do book..."
Rainbow Dash,Where she lives?
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh... no, though I could probably find out somehow. Why?"
Rainbow Dash,"Don't you get it? The new book is obviously delayed because she needs help dealing with whatever everyday nonsense is distracting her from spending her every living breathing second writing! So I<U+0096> I mean, fans like me, can get to read the new book ASAP! Think about it! We could help her with her laundry, buy her groceries, cooking her meals, whatever! Now, who wouldn't appreciate that?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hmm, I don't know... What she probably wants most of all is respect for her privacy."
Rainbow Dash,She can always just say no.
Twilight Sparkle,Mmh... I suppose you're right...
Rainbow Dash,Of course I am. So... how's about getting that address?
Twilight Sparkle,You see what I mean? Why would she live in this remote part of Equestria except to keep folks from intruding on her privacy? We should respec<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,I think I spotted the house! We're super close! This way!
Twilight Sparkle,Wait! Oh no. What happened?
Rainbow Dash,Apparently somepony has intruded on her privacy pretty hard already...
Applejack,"Hoo-wee, somepony really trashed this place."
Pinkie Pie,"Hmm... Maybe... or maybe A.K. Yearling's just a terrible, horrible, unbelievable slob!"
Rarity,I hope A.K. Yearling's alright!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh no! What if something terrible happened to her?
Rainbow Dash,"I know! There might be no more books! Uh... But, of course, I'd be worried about her, too. Heh."
A.K. Yearling,A.K. What are you all doing here?
Twilight Sparkle,We didn't do this! We swear!
A.K. Yearling,A.K. What have you done to my house?
Applejack,"We didn't do this, Ms. Yearling<U+0097> whoa!"
Twilight Sparkle,We're awfully glad to see you're alright.
A.K. Yearling,A.K. [sighs] It's safe.
Rainbow Dash,Great! Maybe now would be a good time for me to ask her how we can help move the new book along a little faster. Chop chop!
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, a minute please! A.K. Yearling has made it pretty clear that she wants to be left alone. We need to respect her wishes!"
Pinkie Pie,You should tell that to those guys.
Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle,A.K. Yearling is Daring Do!
Twilight Sparkle,A.K. Yearling and Daring Do are one and the same! My mind is officially blown!
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, come on, I knew it all along."
Applejack,Amazing!
Rarity,Incredible!
Pinkie Pie,Wow! So much action! Whee!
Rainbow Dash,Daring Do!
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. Many thanks, Daring Do. As you've probably surmised, our earlier search for this treasure was... unsuccessful. So kind of you to find it for us."
Daring Do,"[grunting] Give it back, Caballeron!"
Dr. Caballeron,Dr. That's Doctor Caballeron to you.
Rainbow Dash,[hushed] He's from book four: Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams. He wanted to partner with Daring Do on her adventures.
Twilight Sparkle,"I know, but she refused! I can't believe it! The real Daring Do and the real Caballeron!"
Daring Do,So let me guess: Ahuizotl has put you up to this? You're stealing the ring to give to him so his hold on the Fortress of Talacon will be good for eight centuries as foretold by prophecy!
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. Close, but... no. I'm going to sell this to him, make a bundle, and retire from archaeology in splendor."
Daring Do,"[grunting] Caballeron, you fool! You're dooming the valley to eight centuries of unrelenting heat!"
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. To market, henchponies!"
Fluttershy,"Uh... should we go in and help her, maybe?"
All except Fluttershy,"Oh, right."
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] Are you okay?
Daring Do,I got this.
Fluttershy,"Um, she was just trying to help, Ms. Do."
Daring Do,Daring Do doesn't need help. She handles her business herself.
Rainbow Dash,We've gotta go help!
Twilight Sparkle,You heard her! She says she works alone!
Rainbow Dash,How can we just stand by and do nothing? You know what's at stake here! Ahuizotl has sought control of the Tenochtitlan Basin since book three!
Twilight Sparkle,"True, but in book four, she defeated Ahuizotl and secured control of the Amulet of Atonement, dispelling the dark magic of the Ketztwctl Empress, and thus protecting the basin with the Radiant Shield of Razdon!"
Rainbow Dash,But the Radiant Shield of Razdon is vulnerable to the dark enchantment of the Rings of Scorchero!
Twilight Sparkle,"But are you forgetting that the Rings were scattered to the four corners of Tenochtitlan, thus rendering the dark enchantment powerless?"
Rainbow Dash,"Only if you assume that the Rings have yet to be retrieved, and the ring Caballeron just stole isn't the last to completely restore the dark tower and its cruel hold on Tenochtitlan! Did you ever think of that?!"
Pinkie Pie,"You gotta admit, Rainbow Dash makes a pretty good point."
Rainbow Dash,We gotta help Daring Do retrieve the ring for safekeeping before it's too late!
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Okay, but sounds to me like we're in way, way, way over our heads. We're going to need a carefully thought out plan..."
Rainbow Dash,"I'm coming, Daring Do!"
Twilight Sparkle,That's not a plan!
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, come on, come on... Bingo! Here I come, Daring Do! To join an adventure with the greatest, bravest, coolest, most incredible hero I could ever<U+0096> [whimpers] Okay, maybe I just need a sec... Just another adventure. No big deal. [smack] Get a grip! I got this. Though, doing it alongside Daring Do... Wow! Maybe I could get my picture taken with her, or an autograph<U+0096> [smack] There you go again. She's just a pony like any other pony. A pony who stops entire armies of bad guys with nothing more than her bare hooves, and an attitude, and<U+0097>! [smack] Ow... That's starting to hurt."
Rainbow Dash,Yow! Stop!
Daring Do,"Oh, it's just you."
Rainbow Dash,"Wait, wait, wait! Let me help you! I promise I could be a huge, huge help if you just give me a chance."
Daring Do,I. Work. Alone.
Rainbow Dash,But why won't you let me team up with you just this once?!
Daring Do,"My work always involves secrets. And since you never know who you can trust, it's best never to trust anypony."
Rainbow Dash,"But just because you can't trust some, doesn't mean nopony can be trusted!"
Daring Do,"Look, I don't have time to argue-"
Rainbow Dash,Neither do I. Let's go!
Daring Do,[sighs] [under her breath] Can't believe I'm even talking to her...
Rainbow Dash,Looks like they decided to have an early dinner before making their way back down the hill to the marketplace in town.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, I see. You're gonna ambush them like in book four at the Horavian caves! Or maybe, that neat trick you did in book three, where you swoop in and knock three guys down with one swing! Or maybe- [hushed] Okay. I'll be quiet now. Just watching very quietly, heh. Shh. So, what kind of ambush are you gonna use then?"
Rainbow Dash,Wow!
Daring Do,[gravely voice] I have been led to believe you have in your possession an item of significant importance that might be... for sale.
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. Oh, uh, well... I did have another buyer lined up, but he's not here, so... sounds like we have a deal."
Ahuizotl,[roars] Caballeron!
Daring Do,Ahuizotl!
Ahuizotl,The ring!
Rainbow Dash,"Be cool, Rainbow Dash, be cool... she's got this!"
Ahuizotl,"The ring, Daring Do! Give it to me!"
Daring Do,"Now, Ahuizotl, you know I love you, but I can't give you the ring 'til I've properly proposed."
Daring Do,Bring it!
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Daring Do, come on..."
Rainbow Dash,Daring Do! I've got your hat! You want me to toss it? Daring Do! Daring Do!
Rainbow Dash,"Don't worry, Daring Do! I'll come help you! Whoa! Ow."
Daring Do,Don't bother! I'd say you've already helped plenty.
Rainbow Dash,What have I done?
Rarity,[gasps] Thank goodness you're alright!
Twilight Sparkle,"Quick, where does it hurt?"
Rainbow Dash,"In here. Daring Do and the ring have been captured by the dreaded Ahuizotl, and it's all my fault."
Twilight Sparkle,"Dash, I'm sure whatever you did was an honest mistake."
Rainbow Dash,Whatever. Let's just go home.
Applejack,We can't go back now! Looks a mite like she needs our help more than ever!
Rainbow Dash,"Trying to help is how I got in this mess in the first place. You were right, Twilight. We should've stayed out of this."
Twilight Sparkle,"Look, there is more going on here than meets the eye. In every Daring Do book, there always is! We can't turn our backs on her!"
Rainbow Dash,"She doesn't want my help, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,Perhaps. But she might need it anyway.
Rainbow Dash,No. My hero's way better off without me.
Applejack,This don't sound like you.
Pinkie Pie,Where's the Rainbow Dash who would help anypony at the drop of a hat?
Rarity,"Or pith helmet, as the case may be."
Rainbow Dash,She's here where she's got no business being. She should be at home.
Twilight Sparkle,"It's fine to look up to Daring Do, but you've put her so high up on a pedestal, you can't even see your own worth anymore! She's in the fortress, and we're here, and we wouldn't be who we are if we didn't go in after her! And neither would you! So, are you with us, or not?"
Ahuizotl,"[laughs] Oh, Daring Do, I will so miss your amusing laughter-jokes. Now, I must leave to commence the ring-placing ceremony to unleash eight hundred years of unrelenting, sweltering heat!"
Rainbow Dash,"Gotcha! [grunts] You can flap too, y'know!"
Daring Do,"I was just about to save myself, y'know."
Rainbow Dash,Of course. I just thought you might need this.
Daring Do,Have I mentioned yet that I work alone?
Rainbow Dash,Have I mentioned yet that you're lucky I don't?
Applejack,"Drop the ring, Ahui... whatever your name is!"
Ahuizotl,"Hmph, place the ring, quickly! Get it!"
Daring Do,Come with me! Help me get all these rings off!
Daring Do,"[panting] If we can remove the giant ring at the bottom, the whole fortress will collapse!"
Rainbow Dash,W-Was this your plan all along?
Daring Do,I had to find a way to get into the fortress.
Rainbow Dash,You did it on purpose?! But<U+0096> but I thought<U+0097>
Daring Do,"I didn't count on how heavy this ring would be, though... Guess having a little help can be handy sometimes."
Ahuizotl,Stop her!
Daring Do,"[straining noises] You can flap too, y'know!"
Rainbow Dash,[straining noises] Ponies! Run! This place is goin' down!
Ahuizotl,Daring Do! I will have my revenge!
Daring Do,"Could never have done this without you, Rainbow Dash. I've got a book to finish!"
Rainbow Dash,"Just had the coolest adventure with the coolest pony ever. Came this close to blowing it because I got so wrapped up in how awesome she was, I almost forgot about how awesome I was. Good thing I didn't, 'cause it gave me a chance to show her how important it is to put your trust in somepony else."
Messenger Pony,Package from A.K. Yearling.
Rainbow Dash,Sweet! The new book a week before anypony else gets it! [inhales] Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Cheerilee,"Today, we have two special guests with a very special announcement! Everypony, welcome the head of the Equestria Games, Ms. Harshwhinny!"
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Thank you. Now, I'm sure you all know about the Equestria Games, where ponies from all over the land compete for glory in various athletic pursuits. Well, now you littlest ones will have the chance to compete for a weighty responsibility of your very own."
Rainbow Dash,"[distant] Oh, come on! Tell 'em the fun part!"
Rainbow Dash,"That's right! All you gotta do is show Ms. Harshwhinny the coolest, most spectacular, most rocking routine and you're going to the Games! So who's going to be the lucky ponies?!"
Diamond Tiara,It's gotta be me!
Aura,Maybe it's me!
Scootaloo,Maybe it's us!
Snips and Snails,Maybe it's us!
Snips,Hey! It could happen!
Rainbow Dash,"So, the winning team gets to carry the Ponyville flag at the Equestria Games! Oh, you are gonna love this!"
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Ms. Dash, will you please curb your over-enthusiastic outbursts? Now then, let me be clear on the rules. You ponies will form teams. Each team will create their own flag carrying routine. Everypony will be judged on grace, style and originality. There's a most complicated scoring system, which I will elaborate upon now. Firstly--"
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, get to the nitty-gritty later. Tell 'em the important stuff! Like who's the coach! [blows whistle] That's right! Me! And you know why I'm qualified to coach you? Guess who carried the Cloudsdale flag in the Games when she was a little filly? Me! I'll never forget it <U+0096>- I burst into the stadium, spreading my wings, the flag flapping in the breeze. I did tricks with that flag the likes of which nopony saw before and nopony's seen since!"
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Professionalism, Ms. Dash. I must insist. If you want to keep your job as coach of these ponies, you must maintain a professional attitude and keep your emotions in check! Am I making myself absolutely, one hundred percent crystal clear?"
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny. Y'know, ""professionalism"" is my middle name. Rainbow Professionalism Dash."
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Hmph! Well, in three days time, Ms. Dash will accompany anypony competing to the Crystal Empire, where you will demonstrate your routines for me and the other judges, who will judge you very professionally."
Rainbow Dash,"Ahem. Yes. Quite, quite correct. In the meantime, get ready to train, and train hard, because I know this opening ceremony is the single most important thing that will ever happen in your young lives! But, I know you're up for the challenge. And so am I! Wooho-- Ahem... Meet me after school tomorrow at 1500 hours. Sharp. And show me your flag carrying skills. I am outta here. Professionally. See how professionally?"
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Ugh. Ponies, the most important thing is this: Your routine needs to show what your town means to you. So, do Ponyville proud. Work hard, be bold, wow me. That is all!"
Scootaloo,So what do you say we come up with the perfect routine and win this thing?
Apple Bloom,I'd say that's rootin'-tootin' terrific!
Sweetie Belle,But there's one problem! I bet everypony in class is planning to compete!
Scootaloo,"Listen. Somepony in our class is gonna carry that flag, so it might as well be us! Crusaders, are you in or are you in? 'Cause I'm in!"
Apple Bloom,Me too!
Sweetie Belle,Me three!
Scootaloo,"Alright, the winning routine needs to show what's important about Ponyville, right?"
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Right!
Scootaloo,So... what's special about Ponyville? It's... It's... I got it! It's a place where different kinds of ponies live together as friends!
Apple Bloom,Earth ponies like me!
Sweetie Belle,Unicorns like me!
Scootaloo,And Pegasi like me! So somehow we got to figure out a way to show that in our act.
Sweetie Belle,We're gonna need a plan.
Apple Bloom,And a lot of hard work!
Scootaloo,"And a whole bunch of practice! But take it from me; we may just be little ponies, but we have hearts as strong as horses!"
Others,"[Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle] We're the toughest little ponies in town Got the moves, got the mojo, no harder working ponies around We are a trio, work as a team We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene"
Others,"We get going when the going gets tough We know our very best is just never enough We're kinda short, but so what? We don't get defeated We could take a little break, but we don't need it"
Others,"We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses"
Others,"When we put our minds together, we can achieve We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and you should believe We've got determination to represent the nation For the win"
Others,We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses
Others,"And we're playing to win as we gallop to glory We can conquer any challenge we're in We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses Hearts strong as horses"
Crusaders,Whoa!
Crusaders,Oof!
Diamond Tiara,"If that's the best you've got, we're going to win for sure."
Silver Spoon,We already have the most divine routine planned.
Diamond Tiara,It's absolutely sure to crush everyone else <U+0096> and I mean crush.
Scootaloo,But we're winners! And we have [starts singing] hearts--
Silver Spoon,Sure. But you know what you don't have?
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon,"Your cutie marks! Blank flanks, blank flanks, blank flanks!"
Apple Bloom,What does that have to do with flag carryin'?
Silver Spoon,Having cutie mark-less ponies represent Ponyville would be unthinkable.
Diamond Tiara,"And we, of course, already have our cutie marks. So we know who's gonna be in the winner's circle."
Scootaloo,"Listen, you two! Cutie marks or no cutie marks, you'll see! The Crusaders are gonna carry that flag at the Games."
Silver Spoon,May the best ponies win!
Scootaloo,Game on!
Rainbow Dash,"Show me what you got, Cutie Mark Crusaders, and make it good!"
Scootaloo,"Don't worry, we will!"
Sweetie Belle,"Now, this is just a little something we threw together. It's not perfect yet, not even close."
Diamond Tiara,"Let's watch the Cutie Mark ""Goof-saders"" do their saddle routine."
Silver Spoon,They're gonna be a hot mess!
Scootaloo,"Since the dawn of recorded time, in one town of amazing amazingness, three types of ponies coexist!"
Apple Bloom,We are Earth ponies!
Sweetie Belle,We are unicorns!
Scootaloo,"We are Pegasi! And the town where friendship reigns is our home. Now, welcome to the stadium, the flag of the place we love best..."
Crusaders,Ponyville forever! Yay!
Scootaloo,It's kind of a work in progress. So? What did you think?
Rainbow Dash,"That was ama-- [in her head] Wait. Hold on now. Gotta stay calm, cool and collected. [out loud] To give a calm, clear analysis-- Wait. You whipped that act together just yesterday?! That is-- [in her head] Professionalism, Dash, keep those emotions in check! [out loud] Overall, it was... kinda, sorta... [quickly] Overall, it was okay. Keep working hard. Who knows? You might have a shot. Gotta go!"
Apple Bloom,Do y'all think she liked it?
Sweetie Belle,I'm not really sure.
Scootaloo,"You heard her! If we keep working hard, we might have a shot! So let's keep working! Trot to it, ponies!"
Diamond Tiara,Did you see that?! I can't believe I'm saying this. They could win!
Silver Spoon,But how do we stop them? We already called them blank flanks!
Diamond Tiara,Then we need to find a new way to get under their skin. Or maybe... get under their wings.
Diamond Tiara,"Girls, we just wanted to say your act is quite impressive!"
Sweetie Belle,Wait... What?
Apple Bloom,Um... Thanks?
Silver Spoon,"Oh, but of course. As a matter of fact, we think you're very brave."
Scootaloo,Brave? Why?
Diamond Tiara,"Isn't it obvious? It is to us. In fact, it's obvious to everypony. You're showing all three types of Ponyville ponies, yet you have a Pegasus pony..."
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon,...who can't even fly!
Apple Bloom,What in tarnation does that have to do with anything?
Silver Spoon,I'd say not even being able to fly has everything to do with everything. Doesn't it?
Diamond Tiara,"I mean, a Pegasus pony at your age? You should've been flying long ago."
Scootaloo,So what if my wings can't get me off the ground?
Diamond Tiara,Your career as a flag carrier isn't getting off the ground either.
Silver Spoon,Ms. Harshwhinny will never pick a Pegasus pony who can't fly to represent Ponyville in front of all of Equestria.
Sweetie Belle,Ms. Harshwhinny never said anything about that!
Silver Spoon,I would've thought that was obvious.
Diamond Tiara,"Well, have fun practicing anyway, even if your routine will never<U+0097>how shall I say<U+0097>take off!"
Sweetie Belle,"Don't listen to them, Scootaloo. Scootaloo? You okay?"
Scootaloo,This routine isn't working how it is. We've gotta rethink my part in the whole thing.
Sweetie Belle,What?
Apple Bloom,Why?
Scootaloo,"If we wanna win, I'm gonna have to fly!"
Sweetie Belle,Is that even possible?
Apple Bloom,And by tomorrow?
Scootaloo,Maybe I can win if I work twice as hard. See? Oof! Maybe... three times as hard.
Apple Bloom,"Golly, I don't know, Scootaloo, I don't think that's the problem."
Scootaloo,"Well, I know this for sure <U+0096> flying is the only way we're gonna win, so it's back to practice!"
Sweetie Belle,Is this a good idea?
Scootaloo,Whoaaaaa!
Scootaloo,I'll just work four times as hard!
Apple Bloom,Probably not.
Scootaloo,"[sighs] Guys, guys, guys! Try it again!"
Apple Bloom,[yawns] But we've been rehearsin' all the livelong day! We're gettin' tired!
Scootaloo,"Fine! We'll skip to my big impressive flying entrance. So you've done the do-si-do to the left, then to the right, and then there's the hoop. Then I come in--"
Apple Bloom,[hushed] I liked the routine the way it was!
Sweetie Belle,[hushed] Me too! But all she cares about now is flying!
Scootaloo,"[panting] Ponyville! Home of the, um..."
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,[hushed] Friendship!
Scootaloo,"Ah, friendship, right! Uh, there are four-- no, three kinds of ponies."
Sweetie Belle,"[hushed] Left, left!"
Apple Bloom,"[hushed] I'm sorry! I'm just tired! And then I dip, and then we turn, and-- Sorry!"
Scootaloo,Ta-da! Oof! [panting] So? What'cha think?
Rainbow Dash,"That's... y'know... good and all, heheh... I just thought... maybe possibly you might wanna go back to, say, the first version of the act, which was, I dunno, what's the word, better? Just do the routine as it was! Don't mess with success, right? Seriously. Now I need to... go coach these other ponies! And don't forget, we've got to catch the early train for the Crystal Empire. See you in the morning!"
Scootaloo,"What are we gonna do?! We're competing tomorrow, and I still can't fly! Unless..."
Sweetie Belle,I'm just too tired! I can't keep going!
Apple Bloom,"Me too! I'm tired, I'm hungry, and now I hate this routine! It feels like it's all about you now!"
Sweetie Belle,She's right. It's like you don't even need us anymore!
Scootaloo,"Of course I need you! Without you two, who's gonna hold up the hoop?"
Apple Bloom,Rrgh! You don't listen to yourself! Forget it. I'm goin' home to get some sleep.
Scootaloo,So? Are you gonna leave me too?
Sweetie Belle,"We've gotta catch the early train to the Crystal Empire. I'd better get some rest. See you in the morning, Scootaloo."
Scootaloo,"Come on, Scootaloo! Do it for Ponyville! Just got to try twenty times as hard! [straining noises] Thirty times as hard...! Oof! Just... a little... harder!"
Scootaloo,[straining noises] [sighs] I can't fly. I just... can't.
Train conductor,Crystal Empire! All aboard!
Sweetie Belle,Scootaloo? Where is she?
Apple Bloom,She'd better get here soon! This here train is about to leave!
Scootaloo,Here I am...
Apple Bloom,We were scared you were gonna miss the train!
Scootaloo,I... I'm not going.
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,What?!
Scootaloo,"I'm the weak link. If I go, and fall, flop, or do anything but fly, I'm gonna blow it for you two."
Sweetie Belle,I can't believe you're quitting on us!
Scootaloo,But you're better off without me!
Sweetie Belle,"But that's not true, Scootaloo!"
Apple Bloom,"You know what, Sweetie Belle? Forget it. If she's gonna quit, we don't want her, and we don't need her!"
Scootaloo,Fine!
Apple Bloom,Fine!
Sweetie Belle,Fine...
Train conductor,All aboard!
Rainbow Dash,"How's my favorite routine going today? Oh, I just can't keep it in! I want you to win so bad! [to the BGM] Bom, bom, bom, bom... and then Scootaloo does that [half-whistles] through the hoop!"
Apple Bloom,"Well, there ain't gonna be a Scootaloo."
Sweetie Belle,She's staying home.
Rainbow Dash,She's what?!
Apple Bloom,"She got it in her head that the only way to represent Ponyville was by flyin' in our routine! When she couldn't do it, she told us that she was quittin'."
Rainbow Dash,"And then you tried to stop her from doing that, right?"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, actually, we kinda told her..."
Apple Bloom,"...uh, that we didn't want a quitter."
Rainbow Dash,"Hang on. Are you nuts?! You're a team, and a team never leaves a friend behind!"
Rainbow Dash,Come on!
Diamond Tiara,Sorry you can't make it! We'll take a picture for you from the winner's circle!
Sweetie Belle,I do not like them one bit.
Rainbow Dash,"Put on some speed, girls!"
Rainbow Dash,Throwing away your scooter?!
Scootaloo,Rainbow Dash?
Rainbow Dash,"Yup, but not just me."
Scootaloo,"I don't wanna see them. And what are they doing here, anyway? They're supposed to be on the train."
Apple Bloom,We're not goin'.
Sweetie Belle,"Not without you, Scootaloo."
Rainbow Dash,"What's gotten into you, Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo,I didn't want to ruin their chance to win just because I couldn't fly.
Rainbow Dash,And who said you had to?
Scootaloo,But flying's what Pegasus ponies are supposed to do! You flew when you carried the flag in the games!
Rainbow Dash,"But that was me! You're you! And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not. Your routine was amazing 'cause it represented exactly what makes Ponyville special. You do still know what that is, right?"
Sweetie Belle,Friendship.
Apple Bloom,Three kinds of ponies livin' together as friends. Just like us. Earth ponies...
Sweetie Belle,...unicorns...
Scootaloo,...and Pegasi. But Rainbow Dash... what if... what if my wings never grow? What if I never fly?
Rainbow Dash,"Listen, Scootaloo. Maybe you'll fly someday, or maybe you won't. You're all kinds of awesome anyway. Who's the toughest little pony in town?"
Sweetie Belle,"Got the moves, got the mojo..."
Apple Bloom,No harder working pony around.
Scootaloo,"We are a trio, work as a team"
Others,"[Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle] We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene"
Scootaloo,So let's get to the Crystal Empire and let's do the routine as it was! And let's win this thing!
Others,"[Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle] We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses"
Others,"And we're playing to win as we gallop to glory We can conquer any challenge we're in We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses Hearts strong as horses"
Crusaders,Ponyville forever! Yay!
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. [through microphone] In the Equestria Games, the Ponyville flag will be carried by... 'Cutie Mark Crusaders'!"
Rainbow Dash,Ahem. Look. What you three did was... acceptable.
Rainbow Dash,"Contain your excitement, Ms. Harshwhinny. Remember <U+0096> professionalism."
Scootaloo,"You know what this means, right?"
Apple Bloom,What?
Scootaloo,We are totally gonna get cutie marks in flag-carrying!
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Yeah!
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, you really need to go to sleep!"
Spike,"Aw, two more minutes, Twilight! I'm just getting to the really good part! The Mane-iac is about to<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"""The Mane-iac""?"
Spike,"The Power Ponies' most evil nemesis! She was the power-mad owner of a hair-care product company. A tragic accident at her shampoo factory in Maretropolis not only gave her mane strange new powers, but also caused her to go completely insane! She and her henchponies are planning to break into the Maretropolis Museum and steal the Electro-Orb, so she can use it to power up her doomsday device! Of course, the Mane-iac wouldn't have even known if Hum Drum hadn't slipped up and told her all about it."
Twilight Sparkle,Hum Drum?
Spike,"Nah, the guy in the blue boots and pointless red cape. The Power Ponies' bumbling and totally useless sidekick. The Power Ponies have to stop the Mane-iac or Maretropolis is doo-hoo-hoo-hoomed!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Believe me, Spike. If anypony understands what it's like to get caught up in a really good book, it's me. But if we're going to make any progress fixing up Luna and Celestia's old castle tomorrow, we all have to do our part. We don't want to be too tired to lend a hoof... or claw."
Spike,"Okay, okay, I'm going to bed. Goodnight."
Twilight Sparkle,Two more minutes.
Spike,Yes!
Twilight Sparkle,"Looking good, everypony! Let's keep this magical makeover moving!"
Rainbow Dash,You got it!
Spike,"Good old Spike is here, ready to do his part!"
Pinkie Pie,"A little more to the left! No, the other left! [quickly] Awesome! That's perfect right where it is! On to the next painting!"
Spike,You sure you don't need any help?
Applejack,"Nah, that's okay."
Pinkie Pie,[quickly] We have everything under control!
Spike,Dash?
Rainbow Dash,I'm good!
Spike,"[sighs] Isn't there anything I can help you with, Twilight?"
Pinkie Pie,"[quickly] Don't worry about it, Spike! It's all good!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I think she's right. It looks like we've got it, Spike. Looking great, everypony! Why don't you find a quiet spot and finish reading your comic? Aren't you right at the part where Hum Drum was about to stop the villain?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, lemme give you a hoof with that!"
Spike,I could do it!
Twilight Sparkle,"That's okay, Spike."
Pinkie Pie,Pony power! Weehee!!
Spike,"[to himself] Mane-iac breaks into the museum... Okay, here we go. ...Ugh, what a surprise! Hum Drum is in the way again while the Power Ponies do all the work! I guess I know what that feels like... [gasps] Wait. What? How can that be the end?! What's... that? ""You can... retr-"" What? ""You can... return..."" Urgh! I know I saw a magnifying glass laying around the last time I was here..."
Applejack,"Spike! Where are ya, Spike?"
Rarity,We're breaking for tea and biscuits!
Rainbow Dash,Spike!
Spike,"[reading] ""You can return to the place you started when the Mane-iac is... defeated."" Huh? ""Take a closer look to join the adventure in this book""? What does that even mean? Whoa! Cool!"
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! What are you<U+0097>
Spike,Heeeeeelp!
Pinkie Pie,Weehee!
Spike,Is this... Maretropolis?
Applejack,Somepony wanna tell me what the hay is goin' on?
Spike,"Holy new personas, ponies! You're the... Masked Matter-Horn! Fili-Second! Zapp! R-Radiance! Mistress Mare-velous! Saddle Rager! You're the... Power Ponies!"
Others,Mane- Power Ponies! [laughs] How kind of you to join us!
Main cast,Huh?
Applejack,Did she just call us... Power Ponies?
Spike,You're the... the superheroes from my comic book! It somehow zapped us all in here!
Rainbow Dash,So somepony zap us back out!
Spike,My comic book! It said the way to get back to where we started was to defeat the Mane-iac! Your arch-nemesis!
Others,Mane- Time for the mane event!
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie! Where'd she go?!
Pinkie Pie,Wheeeeeeee!
Spike,"She could be miles away from here by now! Pinkie is Fili-Second, the fastest pony in all of Maretropolis!"
Spike,Twilight! Freeze her mane!
Twilight Sparkle,Do what?
Spike,You're the Masked Matter-Horn! You can shoot all kinds of crazy power beams from your horn!
Spike,"Dash! Quick! You're Zapp, and your superpower is controlling the mighty forces of nature! Unholster the lightning bolt!"
Spike,"Lightning, not a tornado!"
Pinkie Pie,Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Whoa-whoa!
Spike,"Fluttershy! You're Saddle Rager! Lose your temper, and you'll turn into a huge, super-strong monster!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, gosh! That wouldn't... be very... polite!"
Spike,Ugh! Rarity! Use your jewelry to create attack constructs!
Rarity,What's an attack construct?!
Spike,"Just think of something, anything, and your bracelet makes it appear!"
Spike,Something useful!
Spike,The Electro-Orb!
Spike,I'm Hum Drum...?! Oh no... [straining noises] Applejack! You gotta... help stop the... tornado from destroying.. the city!
Applejack,"But every time I move, this darn lasso gets tighter!"
Spike,"You're psychically connected to it! Will it to where you want it to go, and it'll obey you!"
Pinkie Pie,[giggles] That was spin-tastic!
Applejack,Lemme get this straight: We've been sucked into some kind of comic-book world?
Spike,"Technically, it's called Maretropolis. And if we wanna get back to Ponyville, I think we have to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device to destroy it!"
Rainbow Dash,No biggie. I was already awesome. And now we've all got superpowers!
Spike,Almost all of us have superpowers...
Rarity,"But you must have them too, Spikey-boo. Your character is wearing a cape!"
Spike,"Yeah, for absolutely no reason. He's pretty much useless..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Good thing you're not really Hum Drum, then."
Spike,"Yeah, good thing..."
Rainbow Dash,"So the six of us Power Ponies will take care of Mane-iac, and get us back to Ponyville!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, where is the Mane-iac building her doomsday device?"
Spike,Her top-secret headquarters! But you'd better get there quick. That glowing orb she just stole is what she's going to use to power it up!
Applejack,"Lead the way, Spike!"
Rainbow Dash,Then leave the rest to us!
Spike,There it is!
Applejack,Is that a... shampoo factory?
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, Power Ponies, here's the plan. Rarity, you, me and<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,"Come on out, Mane-iac! Or the Power Ponies are comin' in!"
Twilight Sparkle,"So much for ""element of surprise""."
Spike,Guess I'll just hang back here doing nothing.
Fluttershy,"Oh, I don't think she's home. Maybe we should just come back later."
Rarity,She's home.
Applejack,Time to Power Pony up!
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! Nice catchphrase!
Twilight Sparkle,Freeze ray!
Rarity,"It's an improvement, darling."
Rarity,"Ooh, I do so love a functional accessory!"
Henchpony,My hair!
Rainbow Dash,Seriously? You aren't even just a little angry right now?
Twilight Sparkle,"Nice work, Power Ponies! Now let's take care of the Mane-iac and get ourselves home!"
Others,"Mane- I don't think so! I have a city to destroy, and I'm not about to let the Power Ponies stop me! Not this time!"
Rainbow Dash,Just watch us!
Spike,The Hairspray Ray of Doom! It stops you in your tracks and renders your powers useless!
Rarity,We'll just see about that!
Spike,"Fluttershy, please! Just a little anger?!"
Fluttershy,"Well, I'm not so much angry as I am concerned, bordering on terrified!"
Spike,Don't spray!
Others,"Mane- [cackles] Oh, Hum Drum, why in all of Maretropolis would I use the Hairspray Ray of Doom on you? Rather pointless, don't you think?"
Spike,What am I supposed to do? I'm useless. No wonder my friends never need me to do anything important. They're the ones with superpowers. They've probably already figured out how to escape.
Spike,Or not!
Fluttershy,"Ahem. I don't mean to interrupt, but aren't you forgetting about somepony?"
Others,Mane- Hum Drum? Little guy? No superpowers whatsoever? [laughs] He's utterly useless!
Others,Mane- Puh-lease. Everypony knows you just keep him around because you [condescending tone] feel sowwy for him. Wah. Wah.
Twilight Sparkle,"Maybe in your world. But in our world, Spike<U+0097> uh, Hum Drum always comes through when we need him! Always!"
Spike,"I'm not like Hum Drum! When my friends really need me, I do come through! And they need me now!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Way to go, Spike!"
Rainbow Dash,Get mad!
Pinkie Pie,Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it!
Others,Mane- Over there! There! There! Idiots!
Rainbow Dash,Need a place to put these guys!
Applejack,"Hold it right there, partner!"
Spike,"Fluttershy, where are you going?"
Fluttershy,You seem to have everything under control.
Spike,"Fluttershy, we need you! You have to power up!"
Fluttershy,"I'm sorry, it's just that nothing is making me mad."
Spike,"Once again, the day is saved by<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,Awesome!
Applejack,Whoo-ee!
Rainbow Dash,Did you see how I was raining down a storm of justice at the end there?!
Applejack,You catch how I was wieldin' that lasso?
Pinkie Pie,Cupcakes?
Rarity,How did you<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"Eh, we had a good half second before we got sucked back out of the comic, and the Maretropolis bakery was only sixty-five blocks away!"
Spike,I'm just glad to be back.
Twilight Sparkle,"We wouldn't have made it without you, Spike. And I hope you realize that just because we don't always need your help, it doesn't mean that we don't think you're helpful."
Spike,And that you don't have to have superpowers to be a super friend.
Twilight Sparkle,But I do have one question. Where exactly did you get that comic book?
Spike,"This one I got in Canterlot at the House of Enchanted Comics. Well, I didn't know it meant they were literally enchanted!"
Spike,"I thought it just meant, like, the comics they sold there had really enchanting storylines! Hey, wait up! I'm an important part of this team, remember?!"
Applejack,Any minute now...
Applejack,What the heck is goin' on? [gasps] They're back!
Applejack,Attention! This is a Sweet Apple Acres code red! I need all hooves <U+0096> and claws <U+0096> on deck!
Rarity,"Calm down, Applejack."
Applejack,Calm down?! How can I calm down at a time like this?! Vampire fruit bats are attackin' Sweet Apple Acres!
Twilight Sparkle,But I thought the fruit bats usually stayed put in the west orchard.
Applejack,"The fruit bats do, but these aren't just your everyday ordinary fruit bats. They're vampire fruit bats! I'll be darned if they think they're gonna sink their fangs into my blue ribbon apple."
Spike,Awesome!
Applejack,This here's our entry into the Appleloosa State Fair's produce competition. [exhales] You know how much TLC goes into getting an apple to grow like this?
Rarity,"Applejack! When you go big, you really go big!"
Applejack,Them vampire bats want to shrivel it up like a raisin!
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sure if we just let them know how special that particular apple is to you, they'll leave it alone."
Applejack,"Yeah, right. Be my guest."
Fluttershy,"Um, excuse me, Mr. Vampire Bat--"
Fluttershy,We were just wondering if maybe you wouldn't mind leaving that really big apple alone?
Applejack,Well? What'd he say?
Fluttershy,Um... yes.
Applejack,Huh?!
Fluttershy,But... it could've been a no.
Applejack,Oh.
Fluttershy,"This is the first vampire fruit bat I've ever met and, well, it might take some time for me to really understand their language."
Applejack,"Uh-huh. And in the meantime, this pest and his vermin friends are gonna go after my prized apple and, while they're at it, every other apple in the orchard! These vampire bats are nothin' but a bunch of monsters!"
Fluttershy,"Monsters?! Oh, that's a bit harsh, don't you think?"
Applejack,"No, I do not."
Applejack,"Those vampire bats will give you a fright Eating apples both day and night They rest for a minute, maybe three Then they're eatin' every apple in your apple tree"
Others,"They don't care about nada, not zilch, no, nothin' 'Cept bringin' about an orchard's destruction"
Fluttershy,"Now wait just a minute, there's another side to this And if I did not defend them, then I would be remiss These bats are mamas and papas too They care for their young just like we ponies do"
Applejack,"Oh, give me a break, you're bein' too kind These creatures have a one-track mind The orchard is not their restaurant But do they ever think what others may want? No! They don't! And that is just a fact These bats, they simply don't know how to act"
Fluttershy,That's where I have to disagree They're loyal to their family Spreading seeds both far and wide
Applejack,"You see one comin', you'd better run and hide! They're big and ugly and mean as sin Will ya look at the state my trees are in?"
Fluttershy,"They help your trees, they'll grow stronger faster"
Applejack,They've turned my life to a total disaster!
Rarity,"Well, I for one don't have a doubt These vermin must be stamped right out"
Rainbow Dash,"I second that, they've got to go These bats, they've got to hit the road"
Applejack,"It comes down to just one simple fact They've crossed the line, it's time to fight them back!"
All except Fluttershy,Stop the bats! Stop the bats! Make them go and not come back! Stop the bats! Stop the bats! Make them go and not come back! Stop the bats! Stop the bats! Make them go and not come back!
Applejack,"Yes, it comes down to just one simple fact They've crossed the line, it's time that we attack!"
Rarity,"I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I believe Applejack has made the better argument. These vampire fruit bats sound downright dreadful."
Applejack,So let's get to roundin' them up so they don't destroy the rest of my orchard.
Pinkie Pie,"[to the tune of Winter Wrap Up] Fruit bat round-up, fruit bat round-up!"
Fluttershy,"Um, excuse me, but, um, what if instead of rounding them up, we... let them have part of the orchard?"
Applejack,[whinny] Have you lost your pest-lovin' mind?!
Fluttershy,"They're only here because they're hungry! If we build a sanctuary for them, they could have their own apples to enjoy! After a while, they could even help the rest of your orchard! The vampire bats don't eat the seeds of the apples, and when they spit them out, they grow into even more productive apple trees!"
Applejack,"Listen, Fluttershy. That sounds real nice 'n' all, but every second we spend buildin' this so-called 'sanctuary' is a second they'll spend destroyin' orchards! You don't know what it was like the last time there was an infestation, but Granny Smith has told me enough stories about it that just the thought of it gives me nightmares! [narrating] Granny says we lost a huge section of orchard that year. They had to ration out apples all winter!"
Rainbow Dash,"What about the cider? There was still cider, right?"
Applejack,Not...a...drop.
Rainbow Dash,"No cider?! No cider?! We need to round up these monsters, and we need to do it now!"
Applejack,"If Granny Smith wasn't with Apple Bloom an' Big Mac checkin' out our produce competition in Appleloosa, she'd be here tellin' us to do just that!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I think Applejack is right. I just wish there was another way we could convince them not to eat them in the first place. Maybe there is...!"
Twilight Sparkle,"So, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that I found a spell that can get the vampire fruit bats to stop wanting to suck the juice from the apples. But in order for the spell to work, I need the bats' full and complete attention."
Fluttershy,[gasps] Oh no.
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, I need you to do your Stare on the bats."
Fluttershy,"Oh, gosh, I don't know."
Rainbow Dash,What's the problem? You've used the Stare plenty of times before!
Fluttershy,"Yes, but it's not something I take lightly. I've made a vow not to use it except in dire circumstances."
Applejack,This circumstance is plenty dire to me!
Rainbow Dash,Me too! Think of the cider! Won't somepony please think of the cider?!
Fluttershy,I'm sorry. I just don't like the idea of taking away the thing that really makes the vampire fruit bats [inhales] vampire fruit bats! It just feels wrong!
Twilight Sparkle,"But if we don't do this, there won't be any apples left for anypony here in Ponyville. Doesn't that feel wrong, too?"
Applejack,"So what's it gonna be, Fluttershy? Will you do your Stare on the bats or not?"
Fluttershy,"Um... Um... Okay, I'll do it."
Fluttershy,They're not icky.
Rainbow Dash,First round of cider's on me!
Applejack,Hold it right there! We've gotta round up these beasts with wings first. Time's a-wastin'!
Rarity,"[muffled] [yelps] Ew, ew, ew, ewwww!"
Rainbow Dash,Gotcha!
Applejack,"Good work, everypony! I think we got 'em all! [to Fluttershy] Now all we need is for you do to your Stare."
Fluttershy,"Oh, um, are you sure I really need-- Okay. I really, really, really hate to do this to you... I just hope you can forgive me..."
Applejack,"Good... Now you go, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,Alright.
Twilight Sparkle,"You can stop staring, Fluttershy."
Spike,Did it work?
Applejack,Only one way to find out for sure.
Rainbow Dash,"Ye-he-heah, whoo!"
Applejack,My crop is saved! Yee-haw!
Rainbow Dash,We'll be drinking cider all winter long!
Applejack,I wanna thank you for your help. I couldn't have done it without you.
Spike,"Aw, don't mention it, Applejack. It was my pleasure! Really!"
Applejack,Now all we gotta do is sweep up these cores so I can start buckin' fresh tomorrow mornin'!
Applejack,"Apple Bucking Day, take two!"
Twilight Sparkle,The spell didn't work!
Applejack,You're darn tootin' the spell didn't work! I think we're gonna have to take more extreme measures!
Rainbow Dash,"I hear ya, Applejack! C'mon, everypony! Let's track down those vampire bats!"
Applejack,Wait a minute... I don't think these bats are the ones that sucked my apples dry.
Rarity,But if the vampire bats aren't eating your apples...
Twilight Sparkle,"Who is? Fluttershy, you're our animal expert. Do you know of any other creature that might be capable of this?"
Fluttershy,I'm sorry. I don't.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, there's only one way to find out. We'll have to catch whoever it is in the act."
Rarity,And how do you propose we do that?
Twilight Sparkle,A stakeout...!
Rainbow Dash,[spookily] The witching hour...
Rarity,"Oh, Fluttershy, it'll be okay. Don't forget, darling, we're all in this together."
Twilight Sparkle,That's right. Nopony leaves this orchard until we've solved this mystery. Agreed?
Rest of main cast,Agreed!
Applejack,"Does everypony have their pony signals? Now remember, Pinkie Pie, only use the signal if you see somethin' suspicious."
Pinkie Pie,I got it. Something suspicious...
Pinkie Pie,Whatcha doin'?!
Applejack,"Alright, now everypony split up. We'll each patrol our own row of the orchard. Whoever or whatever's destroyin' my apples has gotta be here somewhere."
Pinkie Pie,What was that?! [gasps] Suspicious! [giggles] It's pony signal time!
Rarity,"Who's there? Oh, well, there's obviously no need to worry about that shadowy figure overhead... [frightened] Or maybe there is! I think I'll just go see how Rainbow Dash is doing..."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh... who's there? Answer me or you'll regret it! Fine, have it your own way! Take that, you, you, you... scarecrow... Oh."
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, what is it?"
Pinkie Pie,Suspicious!
Pinkie Pie,Fluttershy? Yoo-hoo! Fluttershy!
Rarity,That's not Fluttershy... That's Flutterbat!
Twilight Sparkle,We've gotta get her down from there!
Rarity,"Uh... Fluttershy, sweetness, please come down, and... do stop being a vampire bat."
Rainbow Dash,"Fluttershy! It's me, Rainbow Dash! Why don't you cut the bat act and come on down?!"
Rainbow Dash,[yelps] Whoa! Maybe we should just let her come down when she's ready.
Pinkie Pie,Flutterbat on the loose! Run for your lives!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, calm down! See? She's back on her... branch."
Pinkie Pie,She's just biding her time! Waiting for the right moment to pounce!
Applejack,"Pinkie Pie, bats don't eat ponies. Not even vampire bats."
Pinkie Pie,But maybe vampire ponies eat other ponies! I'm not taking any chances!
Rarity,How did this happen? That's what I don't understand.
Twilight Sparkle,I think this was actually our fault.
Rainbow Dash,Our fault?
Applejack,And how'd you figure that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, so this is me, these are the bats, and this is Fluttershy doing her Stare. The spell was supposed to go right onto the bats like this, but somehow the spell must have backfired. It took the vampire fruit bats' desire to be vampire fruit bats and transferred that desire into Fluttershy. C'mon! We'll reverse the spell and make it right!"
Pinkie Pie,Then what are we waiting for? Let's save Fluttershy before that thing eats us all!
Rainbow Dash,Hit the deck!
Pinkie Pie,Follow that bat!
Rarity,I can't believe we lost her!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Fluttershy, where are you?"
Applejack,Look out! Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,"If she keeps this up, your whole crop will be gone in no time!"
Applejack,That's the least of my worries. I just want my friend back.
Twilight Sparkle,We'll never get her back unless we corner her and catch her so I can reverse the spell!
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] There she is!
Applejack,There she goes!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, this is no use. I think the only way we're gonna catch her is if we find a way to lure her closer to us."
Applejack,"But even if we can lure her to us, how're we gonna get her to stay still long enough for you to do your reverse spell?"
Pinkie Pie,"Aww, if only we had Fluttershy to do her Stare on the Flutterbat."
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] That's it!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, let's get our friend back. Action stations!"
Rainbow Dash,"So much for having the winning apple in the Appleloosa State Fair, huh?"
Rainbow Dash,[hushed] She's coming!
Fluttershy,Oh... where am I?
Applejack,Thank goodness you're okay!
Fluttershy,But... what happened to me?
Pinkie Pie,You turned into a vampire pony!
Fluttershy,[gasps] I tried to eat ponies?!
Pinkie Pie,Of course not!
Fluttershy,So I wasn't a vampire?
Pinkie Pie,Yes!
Fluttershy,"Yes I was, or yes I wasn't?"
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, you were!"
Fluttershy,But I didn't try and eat ponies?
Pinkie Pie,Yes!
Fluttershy,I did?!
Pinkie Pie,No!
Fluttershy,I'm confused...
Rarity,Me too... and I was there!
Applejack,"Fluttershy, I'm real sorry I didn't take your suggestion in the first place."
Fluttershy,"And don't forget, now you'll get seeds that will grow into even bigger and better apple trees."
Rainbow Dash,Does that mean what I think it means?
Applejack,Yup! More cider too.
Rainbow Dash,"Yea-he-heah, whoo!"
Spike,"Okay, got the part about the spell, Fluttershy turning into a bat, building a sanctuary..."
Applejack,Be sure to put in there that I came to see that my short-term solution was a little short-sighted.
Fluttershy,And that you shouldn't let anypony pressure you into doing something that you don't think is right. Sometimes you have to tell even your closest friends 'no'.
Applejack,"Now, how about we celebrate our stronger than ever friendship with a nice, ripe, juicy apple?"
Spike,"There you are, Rarity! That's the last of your bags."
Rarity,"Actually, Spike, I've got one last pile of bags, over there. Won't you be a dear?"
Rarity,"An entire week in the fabulous city of Manehattan! Plus, all of my very best friends there with me!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Of course we'd all come along to support you during Fashion Week, Rarity!"
Fluttershy,Not that you'll need it. We're sure you'll win.
Rarity,[squeals] I can't begin to tell you how excited I am that you'll all be there with me! However... Perhaps I can show you...
Twilight Sparkle,What's that?
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, I know! A paper fan!"
Rarity,"No, it's<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"A magic trick! You know, where I pick a card and remember what it is and then you put it back in the deck so you can't look at it and<U+0097>"
Rarity,These are tickets to the hottest musical on Bridleway!
Twilight Sparkle,You couldn't mean Hinny of the Hills... because that show's been sold out for months! Or could you?!
Rarity,I could. I do.
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Oh, Rarity, you didn't have to do that, but... since you did..."
Pinkie Pie,This trip is fun already! I love jumping up and down! Whee-hee!
Rarity,"Come along, ponies! I found us a place to stay only a block from the train station in the very heart of this glorious metropolis!"
Applejack,"Hey, look! That's the theatre where Hinny of the Hills is playin'!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Rarity! How'd you manage to get us seats for tomorrow night?"
Rarity,"Oh, I gave some designs to the costume designer, so he pulled a few strings."
Others,"Applejack, Cool!"
Rarity,"That is what makes Manehattan so splendid and amazing. You do something nice for somepony, and then you never know when they'll do something nice for you!"
Applejack,So then you can do something nice for us!
Fluttershy,Like get us in to see Hinny of the Hills!
Rainbow Dash,Which is only the best musical in all of Equestria!
Applejack,It must be good if Rainbow Dash is impressed. Normally she doesn't even like musicals.
Rainbow Dash,I know. Ponies just bursting into song in random places at the drop of a hat? Who does that?
Rarity,"Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me Such a huge bustling community And there's always opportunity To do the friendly thing"
Others,"If some are grouchy, pay no mind Surprise instead with something kind Lo and behold, you may just find A smile is what you bring"
Others,"""Luggage Cart"": Welcome to the Manefair Hotel! Please allow me to take those bags to your room for you!"
Rarity,Only if you'll accept this gratuity first.
Others,"""Luggage Cart"": Oh-ho-ho! I'll get your change!"
Rarity,Do keep it all. I insist!
Rarity,"Generosity, I'm here to show all that I can give Generosity, I'm here to set the bar Just sit back and watch how I live"
Rarity,After you.
Tourist Pony 1,"Why, thank you."
Rarity,"Please, take mine."
Others,"""Wisp"": Wow, okay."
Rarity,"Some may say, ""Rarity, Don't be so big-hearted and bold Treating strangers like they're friends This town's too big and cold"""
Others,"But this is how I play my cards I'm not about to fold Where I see a frown, I go to town Call me the smile patrol"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, Manehattan, what you do to us"
Fluttershy,What if you find a Gloomy Gus?
Applejack,It's no intimidatin' thing
Pinkie Pie,Just be kind without a fuss
Rarity,"Generosity, I'm here to show all that I can do Generosity, you are the key Manehattan, I'm here just for you Just for you"
Rarity,"[sigh] To think my dresses could soon be displayed on the most glamorous shopping thoroughfare of the most glamorous city in Equestria! Oh, it would be my dream come true!"
Twilight Sparkle,Is there anything left to do we can help you with?
Rarity,"Hm, nothing I can think of. The dresses are all completely finished, all made from a fabulous new fabric I've been developing for months. Stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery, but not showy."
Fluttershy,Sounds amazing.
Rarity,There's nothing left for me to do but check in at the runway with my dresses by two this afternoon.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, that's funny. Because that clock over there makes it seem like that's only ten minutes from now!"
Rarity,"Oh, my ribbons and threads. And the runway ballroom is all the way across town! If I don't get there, I'm disqualified! Taaaaxiii!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! We've gotta help her find a cab, now!"
Rainbow Dash,"I'm on it! Hey, buddy! Is this cab taken?"
Cherry Fizzy,"The line ends back there, ""buddy""!"
Rainbow Dash,Huh? What? Does everypony in this town want a cab?
Rarity,I'm afraid getting a taxi at this time could prove almost impossible!
Twilight Sparkle,Please won't you let her have this taxi? She has somewhere very important to be right away!
Businesspony,Not likely! She can get in line like the rest of us!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, it's no use! The cab drivers just drive right past to get to the next pony in line!"
Others,"""Pronto"": New wheel works like a charm! So now which of you nice folks are hoppin' in?"
Rarity,Fashion runway plaza in seven minutes. Can you make it?
Others,"""Pronto"": Hang on!"
Rarity,Ta-ta!
Spike,"Whew, that was close."
Spike,Anypony else got a sneaking suspicion we're forgetting something?
Main cast sans Spike,The dresses!
Rarity,"[out of breath, quickly] Good afternoon, I'm here for Fashion Week!"
Janine Manewitz,"Everypony's gathered in front of the runway and about to start, so you'll just have to bring your dresses along with you and store them backstage later."
Rarity,My<U+0096> My dresses! How could I possibly forget them?! [gasps] I'm dooooomed!
Others,"""Luggage Cart"": Got 'em right here, ma'am! Your friends told me you need these in a hurry, so I offered to race 'em over myself. ""Anything for that nice mare,"" I told 'em!"
Rarity,You're a lifesaver!
Rarity,"[sighs] I made it! And with seconds to spare! Hello, everypony. Pleased to meet you all."
Prim Hemline,"Rarity, I presume."
Rarity,"You must be Prim Hemline, the host of this grand event. How do you<U+0097>?"
Prim Hemline,"Miss Rarity, how is it that all your competitors are here half an hour early, and yet you arrive seconds before we begin?"
Rarity,"Uhhhh... [chuckles nervously] Just... lucky, I guess."
Prim Hemline,"Once we're done here, you're to finish setting up backstage, so you'll be ready for your run-through appointment. You show your designs last. We keep to a precise schedule, so let's try to be more than a few seconds early, hmm? Tomorrow is the contest to see which one of you gets to stay to meet top designers all across the city. The rest of you must go home early. So sad. Dismissed!"
Suri Polomare,"[chuckles] I'm so glad you made it, Rarity!"
Rarity,"Me too, but everything just seems to keep working out!"
Suri Polomare,Don't you remember me? Suri Polomare from the Ponyville Knitters League?
Rarity,"Oh, yes, of course, of course! I<U+0096> I thought you looked familiar, but I couldn't place it. You haven't been back in years!"
Suri Polomare,"Because I moved here to make it in the big city. [laughs], okay?"
Rarity,"Oh, good for you, Sur<U+0097>"
Suri Polomare,"Ooh, it's so good to see you! And now here we are, competing! [laughs], okay?"
Rarity,"Yes, yes. Well, good luck!"
Suri Polomare,"Oh, I don't need luck. Would you like a hoof with your things?"
Rarity,"Why, thank you so much!"
Suri Polomare,"My, your collection is gorgeous!"
Rarity,"Oh now, I'm sure your collection is equally lovely, if not more so!"
Suri Polomare,"It's alright, but nothing like this! Take my culottes, for example <U+0096> they are simply crying out for just the right accent, but I haven't the slightest notion where I<U+0097> [gasps] Actually... just a touch of this fabric could be perfect with it. W<U+0096> Oh, hey, would you mind terribly if I took a swatch?"
Rarity,"Oh, not at all! Here, I have loads extra."
Suri Polomare,You're sure?
Rarity,"Positive! Oh, well, it's been wonderful getting caught up, and I don't wish to be rude, but I must finish my preparations and I am a bit late as it... is?"
Rarity,"Hello! I'm here half an hour early for my run-through appointment, just the way Prim likes!"
Janine Manewitz,"Get in line over there. Oh my, that fabric's gorgeous, did you make that yourself?"
Rarity,"Oh, why, yes. It's stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery<U+0097>"
Suri Polomare,"[simultaneously] Shimmery, but not showy. And the entire line is in the same adorable pattern. It works on everything from skirts to tops to shoes and, [chuckles]..."
Prim Hemline,"Oh, bravo! I've never seen anything like it!"
Rarity,You stole my fabric!
Suri Polomare,"[laughs] I didn't steal it, okay? You gave it to me, 'member?"
Rarity,I gave you the fabric for accents! Not for your whole line! And how could you possibly make all of those outfits out of it so fast?!
Suri Polomare,Fast? Hah! Coco Pommel here took practically forever. Nearly got me completely disqualified.
Coco Pommel,"Well, I wanted to make sure you'd win, so I took the extra time to<U+0097>"
Suri Polomare,"Quiet! I pay an assistant to sew and get coffee, not talk. 'Kay?"
Rarity,[gasps] How could this happen?
Suri Polomare,"Aw, sweetie, don't blame yourself. It takes some small-town fillies a while to learn it's everypony for herself in the big city, m'kay?"
Suri Polomare,Hope you realize how fortunate you are to have me as a mentor. Now get me some coffee!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, my gosh, what a great afternoon! That was almost too much fun!"
Rainbow Dash,"Better pace yourself, 'cause the rest of the day is jam-packed!"
Applejack,First there's the salon appointment to get our manes done.
Pinkie Pie,Then our fancy dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern!
Fluttershy,And after that...
Rainbow Dash,Is... everything okay?
Pinkie Pie,"You got the dresses the bellhop brought you and everything, right?"
Rainbow Dash,But he said he brought them.
Twilight Sparkle,"Now, Rarity, whatever went wrong, we're all here to help you get through it, no matter what it takes."
Applejack,"Come on, Rarity, buck up! All we need is some fabric and you'll be back in business!"
Rarity,"[gasps] This new line is going to be marvelous! Perhaps even better than the last! It's daring, it's bold! Perhaps I still have a chance after all!"
Rarity,Twilight! Sew these pieces together according to that pattern there!
Twilight Sparkle,"You said if we skipped dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern, you'd order a meal for us while we keep working."
Rarity,"Don't fret. It'll be here in an hour. That's not going to be a problem, is it?"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, we're supposed to be watching Hinny of the Hills by then..."
Rarity,"Oh! I see! I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show, and this is how you repay me? By abandoning me in my hour of need? Oh, oh, oh! Fine! Go and see Hinny of the Hills tonight! And then tomorrow morning when you come to see my fashion show without any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment! ""Oh, why look, there's our friend Rarity going down in flames! Isn't friendship magic?!"""
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, calm down. What's gotten into you?"
Rarity,"What's gotten into you?! Oh, go ahead! See your little show! Congratu-pony-lations, fillies! Sounds like you've all figured out already it's everypony for herself in this town!"
Twilight Sparkle,There. That's the last of them.
Rarity,[gasps] Finally!
Twilight Sparkle,You're welcome!
Prim Hemline,Let's have another round of applause for Suri Polomare's amazing collection.
Prim Hemline,That fabric! So original!
Suri Polomare,"[chuckles] Well look who's here. Here to show off your copycat collection, mm? Heh."
Prim Hemline,"And now, Rarity from Ponyville with her brand new line <U+0096> and I mean ""brand new"" <U+0096> Hotel Chic."
Rarity,"Oh! They're liking it! I think I may have just won this thing! Oh, I can't wait to celebrate with... My friends. They didn't come. What have I done?"
Prim Hemline,"Rarity, they all adore you! Aren't you going to tell them about your fabulous pieces?"
Rarity,I have to go.
Prim Hemline,[gasps] Come back at once!
Prim Hemline,This is unheard of!
Others,"""Luggage Cart"": How do you do, ma'am? Contest going well?"
Rarity,No time to talk. I have to find my friends!
Others,"""Luggage Cart"": Oh, uh, they're gone already. I saw them headed out this morning."
Rarity,"Oh, no! Back to Ponyville, I imagine. Oh, they worked so hard on my behalf! And I repaid them with unkindness. What have I done?! Oh... here you are."
Others,"""Luggage Cart"": But miss, I<U+0096> I didn't do anything!"
Rarity,"Oh, Manehattan, what have I done? The thought of Fashion Week was fun But I went way too far My friends gave to me in ways so kind And I gave them nothing but a hard time"
Others,And now alone I stand And now alone I stand
Rarity,"I need a moment with Prim Hemline. I have to rush back to Ponyville, but I just wanted to thank her first for<U+0097>"
Suri Polomare,"Uh-uh-uh, you'd best steer clear of Prim for a while. She's pretty furious. Isn't that right?"
Coco Pommel,Um... yes.
Rarity,"There you all are! I can't believe it, I thought you went back home!"
Twilight Sparkle,We missed the show because we overslept. Suri told us you lost. I'm really sorry.
Rarity,I lost? You know what? I don't even care. I'm just happy you're all still here after how I treated you. Taking advantage of your friendship the way I did. How could you ever see past it?
Applejack,"Yeah, you were pretty rotten."
Rainbow Dash,"Wow, Applejack. I know your thing is honesty, but come on!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Last night we may not have seen you at your best, but we know you. And we would never let one thing like that change how we feel about you."
Rarity,"Oh, thank you! You really are the most wonderful friends a pony could have! You know, I already arranged to make it up to you this afternoon! Hope you're all available for an exclusive performance of Hinny of the Hills!"
Suri Polomare,"And that is how it's done. Pretty clever how I convinced her to stay away from Prim, wasn't it? [chuckles] Wouldn't have wanted her to find out the truth now, would we?"
Hinny of the Hills,[singing] And I'm a dancing pony!
Applejack,Wow! That was even better than I imagined!
Rainbow Dash,"I loved it! [beat] Uh, I mean, it was a'ight."
Twilight Sparkle,How did you ever get them to agree to do an extra performance just for us?
Rarity,"Remember my costume designer friend who got me the tickets? Well, I offered to make all the costumes for his next show!"
Fluttershy,"Um, here in Manehattan?"
Rarity,"Well, um... yes... it will keep me away from Ponyville for a while."
Rarity,But I so wanted you to see this show! And working for this designer is such a great opportunity!
Applejack,"We know. We're happy for you, Rarity. We're just sad for us."
Coco Pommel,Mind if I join you?
Rarity,Sure. Come on down. This is the first place trophy for Fashion Week. [gasps] With my name on it! But I thought I lost!
Coco Pommel,"You didn't. You won. Suri was hoping that if you didn't claim your prize, the judges would consider it a forfeit and first place would go to her. So she lied to make you and your friends go away, and, well, I lied too. I've worked for Suri for so long, I started to believe that it really is everypony for herself in this town. Until I saw how generous you were with your friends and how generous they were with you. It made me start believing there was something better for me out there. So, I<U+0096> I quit. I brought you something to say thank you."
Rarity,Hm. I suppose you'll need a job now that you're no longer with Suri. How would you like to work for my friend making all the costumes for his next show?
Rarity,"Manehattan was simply grand. It was in this magnificent metropolis that I learned that, while there are ponies who will take advantage of your generosity, you should never, ever let that cause you to abandon your generous spirit. Nothing feels worse than taking advantage of the giving nature of your friends."
Pinkie Pie,Whatcha doin'?
Twilight Sparkle,Aaagh!
Twilight Sparkle,Just some genealogical research.
Pinkie Pie,Ohhh. [whispering] I don't know what that is.
Spike,"Genealogy is the study of family history. Y'know, where ponies come from and who they're related to."
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, fascinating."
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe you should pick one from the... top?
Pinkie Pie,"Uh-huh... Interesting... I see... Hmm, that makes sense... Not much of a surprise there... WHAT?!? This is the most amazing thing ever! Why didn't you tell me how amazing this is?! Genealogy is better than cotton candy on top of a fountain of chocolate! [thud] You'll never believe who it says I'm related to!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, cousin!"
Applejack,"This is just so excitin', I can hardly believe it!"
Pinkie Pie,I know! Isn't it the best?
Apple Bloom,I have another sister! I have another sister!
Pinkie Pie,"Well, you actually have a fourth cousin twice removed by a fifth cousin, but that's like exactly like a sister!"
Applejack,"I'd try to tone it down a little around non-family members, because I don't want to make them jealous, but..."
Apple Bloom,This is the best family ever!
Applejack,"It really is. You are gonna love bein' an Apple. I mean, you've got the playful one..."
Applejack,The strong one...
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,"And of course, there's Granny Smith, who knows everythin' about everythin'!"
Granny Smith,A Ponyville snail can hibernate for up to forty-eight moons!
Pinkie Pie,Who knew?
Applejack,"And then there's me. [sniffs, exhales] Do you smell that sweet apple air, Pinkie Pie?"
Applejack,That was rhetorical. Of course you smell it. You're an Apple now!
Apple Bloom,And Applejack is the one responsible for it!
Applejack,"Aw, Apple Bloom, that is sweet, but--"
Apple Bloom,It's true! I mean she keeps us all organized and on schedule and does her own part on top of it all!
Big McIntosh and Granny Smith,Mm-hmm.
Pinkie Pie,I was already super happy as a Pie! And now I get to be a part of this amazing family too?
Apple Bloom,"It's even more amazin' now that you're in it! [rhythmically] We're family, we're family, you an' me are family!"
Pinkie Pie,Best family twirl everrrrrrr!
Applejack,"Huh, I just can't believe we've never heard anythin' about this before! Hmm..."
Apple Bloom,"What's wrong, sis?"
Applejack,I'm not seein' where exactly it says we're family.
Pinkie Pie,It's riiiiiiiii- [inhales] -iiiiiight here!
Applejack,It... is?
Pinkie Pie,Uh-huh. Applesauce of the Apple family lineage is a fourth cousin twice removed of the Pie family!
Applejack,"I see the part about our great, great auntie Applesauce and fourth cousin twice removed part, but that last bit's awful smudged. Are you sure it says 'Pie'?"
Pinkie Pie,"I guess it is a little smudged, but I see most of it there, and when I read it, I knew in my heart it was true!"
Granny Smith,"Well, ain't that just the sweetest thing!"
Applejack,"It is, it is. I'd just hate for us to get all excited before we found out for sure."
Apple Bloom,So how are we supposed to find out for sure?
Granny Smith,"Ehhhh... Oh! Cousin Goldie Delicious! Her cabin's practically an Apple family history museum! If anypony has the records to back up Pinkie's theory, it's her!"
Applejack,"Huh, I suppose we could always... I mean, Goldie Delicious doesn't live that far away, and we haven't been on one as a family in a real long time... Are y'all thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Apple family,Family road trip!
Granny Smith,Has anypony seen my travelin' bonnet?
Apple Bloom,Isn't that it on your head?
Granny Smith,No!
Apple Bloom,It looks an awful lot like--
Granny Smith,"Well, it ain't, and that's final!"
Applejack,"Hey, everypony? Since Pinkie Pie's back home gettin' her stuff for the trip, can y'all gather round? I just wanted to say somethin' real quick."
Granny Smith,"I've had somethin' in my teeth this whole time, haven't I? Gadsnickety, what a way to welcome a family member!"
Applejack,"Er, no, Granny, your teeth are fine. I just wanted to be sure that we're all on the same page about showin' Pinkie Pie how awesome a family we really are. We want her to get to know the family she's been born into, but, like, the best version of it, y'know?"
Granny Smith,"Oh, [blows raspberry]. Don't you worry, honey. We're a great family, and she can't help but see it."
Apple Bloom,I'll bet my future cutie mark's gonna be a picture of me bein' the best behaved pony ever! That's how good I'm gonna be! Big Mac?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Pie,Are y'all ready to go? Because I'm ready to go-go-go!
Applejack,"Er, Big Mac? Are you sure we really need all that stuff?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,Are you sure you're strong enough to really pull all that stuff?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,Are you sure the wagon's strong enough to hold it all?
Big McIntosh,[groans] Eeyup!
Applejack,Then lets get this show on the road!
Applejack,"C'mon, Apples, y'all know this one!"
Granny Smith,Hot-diggity!
Applejack,Yee-haw!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,We've traveled the road of generations Joined by a common bond We sing our song 'cross the pony nation From Equestria and beyond
Applejack and Apple Bloom,"We're Apples forever, Apples together We're family, but so much more No matter what comes, we will face the weather We're Apples to the core"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,There's no place that I'd rather be Than travelin' with my family Friends all around come to join and see As we sing out across the land
Others,"[Applejack, Big McIntosh, and Apple Bloom] We're Apples forever, Apples together We're family, but so much more No matter what comes, we will face the weather We're Apples to the core"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Granny Smith,"We're peas in a pod, we're thick as thieves Any clich<e9> you can throw at me We're here for each other, through thick and thin You're always welcome with your Apple kin Wheeeeee!"
Pinkie Pie,"You're more fun than the color pink Or balloons flying over your favorite drink The love I feel here is swim, not sink As we party across this land"
Apples,All right!
All,"We're Apples forever, Apples together We're family, but so much more No matter what comes, we will face the weather We're Apples to the core!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Applejack,"Big Mac! I thought you said<U+0096> Uh, I thought<U+0096> I mean, not that I'm blamin' you, because we don't blame in this family, but I thought you said all this stuff wasn't gonna be too heavy."
Apple Bloom,How're we supposed to get to Goldie Delicious now?
Granny Smith,"I don't know, but I don't see how we can go back now either. We're closer to cousin Goldie's that we are to home."
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] I have the best... idea... ever! Family river trip!
Applejack,Heh. Just one problem. We haven't got a raft. [under her breath] 'Bout the only thing that didn't get packed.
Granny Smith,"Well, back in the old days, we used to use the sap from a sugar pine tree to glue things together."
Applejack,"That is, uh, fascinatin'... Don't know that it's helpful, but it is fascinatin'..."
Granny Smith,"Pfft! 'Not helpful', my patootie! We're gonna build ourselves a raft out of these here jalopy parts and keep it held together with sugar pine sap!"
Applejack,"Hm, worth a shot!"
Pinkie Pie,Woo-hoo!
Applejack,"Could be worse, I guess. Now remember, this time we're only packin' the necessities."
Pinkie Pie,Wait a second!
Pinkie Pie,This one is for the scrapbook!
Applejack,"Pinkie Pie, when did you have time to make this?"
Pinkie Pie,"Applejack, when you're family, you make the time."
Applejack,Woo-hoo! We did it!
Pinkie Pie,Say 'soaked'!
Pinkie Pie,"So what you're saying is, if I have the courage to jump, the parachute will open."
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Pie,Whoa! That is deep!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,"Uh-oh... All right, y'all. Please tell me that the map didn' get wet. 'Cuz it looks like I'm gonna need it right about now."
Apple Bloom,"Found it! Who's got the map? I got the map! M to the A to the yeah, that's right, P Ain't no other pony found a map like me I'm Applel<U+0097>"
Others,Uh-oh.
Applejack,"[through gritted teeth] All you had to do was bring it to me. No singin', no dancin', no games. Just walk it over!"
Big McIntosh,[through gritted teeth] Eeyup.
Pinkie Pie,Say 'best siblings ever'!
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, that's another keeper!"
Granny Smith,"It's okay, y'all! I travelled down this river as a filly and I know it like the back of my hoof!"
Applejack,Are you sure you know which way to go?
Granny Smith,Does a June bug like to hide in a tree?
Applejack,Uh... I don't know.
Granny Smith,"Well, I do know! And I also know we wanna head southeast! Now step aside, young'un!"
Applejack,"Um, Granny?"
Granny Smith,Myuh-huh?
Applejack,Are we supposed to go through a cave?
Granny Smith,"Ah, don't worry, child! The scariest cave in Equestria was down that other way!"
Apple Bloom,The scariest cave in Equestria?
Granny Smith,"Oh, it's a fright all right! Filled with creatures that'll eat ya soon as look at ya!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, sounds scary. Tell us more!"
Granny Smith,Ponies go in... but they never come out!
Applejack,And you're sure it's not that cave? The one we're headin' straight for?
Granny Smith,"Now, Applejack, I taught you better than to question your elder ponies!"
Applejack,Heh... you sure did.
Granny Smith,Alrighty then. Now everypony just sit on back an' leave the steerin' to your old Granny Smith.
Granny Smith,See now? Told ya th--
Pinkie Pie,Got it! Best scary unidentifiable creature ever! Say 'terrified'!
Granny Smith,"Guess that was the scariest cave in Equestria. Uh, of course I meant to take us through it! Unexpected adventure is good for the soul!"
Pinkie Pie,Best granny wisdom ever!
Applejack,"Uh-huh. Why don't you just scooch on over there, Granny? Think I'll take it from here on out."
Granny Smith,Huh! Is that how I taught you to treat your elder ponies?
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! Ooh! Is it?
Applejack,You taught me to trust my common sense. And my common sense says we should get to Goldie Delicious's cabin in one piece.
Granny Smith,And that is exactly what I'm gonna do!
Applejack,"That is mighty generous of you, but I think you've done enough for one day."
Granny Smith,And how exactly are you gonna know which way to go?
Pinkie Pie,Hmmmmmmm?
Applejack,It would be easier if the map hadn't gone overboard!
Apple Bloom,Hey! There wouldn't have been an overboard if Big Mac hadn't overpacked the jalopy!
Big McIntosh,Eeyu- hey!
Applejack,"Exactly! So I think we can all agree that from here on out, I should be in charge of everythin'."
Pinkie Pie,"I just wanna say... that I think you're all super duper, and I can't wait to make a page in my scrapbook about the amazing waterfall we went down!"
Pinkie Pie,Wheeeee!
Granny Smith,Huh! Told you that sugar pine sap would hold this thing together.
Applejack,"Uh, Pinkie Pie? Maybe you could read that one out loud?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, right, sorry! I haven't even read it yet. I was just looking at how pretty the paper is. Okay, it says that she ran off to run some errands but will be home soon! Oh, that's perfect!"
Apple Bloom,Why is that perfect?
Pinkie Pie,Because it'll give me enough time to get more scrapbook paper! See ya!
Apple Bloom,Worst family road trip. Ever.
Big McIntosh,[sadly] Eeyup.
Applejack,I can't believe she witnessed our family fallin' apart like this. [sighs] I can't believe I was arguin' with you so much that I tore the wheel right off the raft. It's like I wasn't myself at all.
Granny Smith,"Aw, that wasn't your fault. My stubborn streak got a hold of me somethin' fierce. Should've let you take the wheel long a'fore that."
Apple Bloom,It was my fault the map got all wet...
Big McIntosh,I was the pony who<U+0097>
Granny Smith,"Now, now, Big Mac, you gotta know we forgive you for packin' the jalopy so much that it collapsed. You was just as eager to please Pinkie Pie like the rest of us."
Applejack,"Everypony, I think we have to let Pinkie Pie know that even if she does discover that she's an Apple, she does not have to feel obliged to consider herself one."
Granny Smith,Sure as applesauce.
Pinkie Pie,Are you kidding me?! You guys are the best family ever!
Applejack,"How can you say that? We started out as one big unit, and now look at us."
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! Now look at you! You're all here still in one big unit, loving each other and owning up to what went wrong! You never gave up, even when things got tough!"
Apple Bloom,She does make a pretty good point.
Pinkie Pie,"You aren't just family, you're best friends! And I wanna be an Apple more than ever!"
Apple Bloom,And we want you to be one too!
Goldie Delicious,Now that's how you run an errand.
Pinkie Pie,Hello!
Goldie Delicious,Hello yourself!
Applejack,You must be Goldie Delicious. So nice to meet you.
Goldie Delicious,Uh-huh. And who exactly are you?
Pinkie Pie,We're Apples!
Applejack,"Well, we think we're all Apples. But we need your help finding out if Pinkie Pie here is our fourth cousin twice removed."
Goldie Delicious,"Well why didn't you say so? If anypony can help solve this genealogy mystery, it's me!"
Goldie Delicious,"Gotta... get some oil... for the hinges... Alrighty then, just have to move a few things out of the way of the door. Ooh! Ah! Get off of that, Mr. Fluffy... Come on, Pooples... Come here, sweetheart... Come on in! Sorry about the mess!"
Applejack,Whoa!
Goldie Delicious,"Oh, careful now. Those belonged to your great-great-great-great uncle Apple Tart!"
Apple Bloom,"Well, whose was this?"
Goldie Delicious,"Well, that was my lunch. A couple of weeks ago."
Goldie Delicious,"[blows dust away] [straining] This here is a complete record of, of our family tree! It's not here, or here, or, or here, or it certainly isn't here, is it...? Oh, here it is! ...Oh, dear."
Granny Smith,"'Oh, dear'? What is it?"
Pinkie Pie,Am I not an Apple after all?
Goldie Delicious,"Well, that's just it. I don't know. The page is all smudged. I sure am sorry, but I don't think I can help you out after all."
Pinkie Pie,"Don't be sorry, it's okay. I'm just a little disappointed that I'll never know for sure if I'm a part of this family."
Applejack,"Well, I know for sure!"
Pinkie Pie,What do you mean? You can't know!
Applejack,"I can know for sure that it doesn't matter what the book says or doesn't say. After all you've been through with us and all you've put up with, it's obvious you're an Apple to the core!"
Granny Smith,Darn tootin'!
Apple Bloom,Yes siree!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! Say 'best family hug ever'!
Apple family,Best family hug ever!
Applejack,"Thanks again for the wagon, Goldie! We'll see you soon!"
Goldie Delicious,Y'all sure you don't want to take any of these Apple family heirlooms home with you?
Big McIntosh,Nnope.
All,"We're Apples forever, Apples together We're family, but so much more No matter what comes, we will face the weather We're Apples to the core!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Applejack,Twilight agreed this was definitely an experience worth puttin' in the journal. Think I'll write about how bein' a good family isn't about bein' perfect as much as it is about bein' able to get through the rough patches together. About bein' able to forgive each other for mistakes.
Apple Bloom,Don't forget to mention how really good friends can also feel like your family.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,You know what? Maybe I should write it. I'm good at makin' things sound excitin'.
Granny Smith,I have a history of excellent storytellin'. I should probably do it<U+0097> Hey! Where in the haystack do you think you're goin' with that there pen?!
Rainbow Dash,"Alright, ponies, listen up!"
Fluttershy,"We're all ears. Right, Bulk Biceps?"
Bulk Biceps,[kissing noises] [grunts] Nuh-uh! I'm all muscles! Yeah!
Rainbow Dash,"I like your attitude, Bulk Biceps, but it's gonna take more than muscles and Yeah!s to get us to the Equestria Games! We are the Aerial Relay team, and it's up to the three of us to make sure that we qualify at the tryouts. And do I need to remind you how much I - I mean, Ponyville, heh <U+0096> wants to qualify and make it to the Games?"
Fluttershy,"I remember. I really, really, really want to qualify for you and Ponyville."
Bulk Biceps,Bring it on!
Pinkie Pie,Gimme a 'P' for 'Ponyville'!
Pinkie Pie,"[through megaphone] P, Ponyville!"
Bulk Biceps,P!
Rainbow Dash,Just make sure you have one ready for when we qualify for the Aerial Relay.
Bulk Biceps,"And after that, for when we win gold medals in the Equestria Games!"
Applejack,"Not so fast! If you're gonna be good, you're gonna be better with some of my apple brown bettys in ya. They're perfect."
Pinkie Pie,'P' is for 'perfect'!
Rainbow Dash,"Alright, team! Show me what you got! Put some bend into those knees! Flap those wings! And I want to see all four hooves off the ground on the count of three! [beat] [quickly] One two three!"
Rainbow Dash,Don't forget to breathe while you're up there!
Pinkie Pie,"'P' is for, uhh... 'pain'?"
Helia,"Good luck, Rainbow Dash! Sorry we couldn't fly with you on the Aerial Relay, but the air sprinters needed us too."
Thunderlane,"Too bad we can only compete in one event. [sighs] But, rules are rules."
Twilight Sparkle,Good luck! [to Rainbow Dash] It was nice of you to be part of the team that doesn't have... uh... the strongest flyers.
Rainbow Dash,"Nothing nice about it. I know that I can pick up the slack for anypony. With me on the team, we'll qualify. I'm sure of it."
Twilight Sparkle,Ponyville is very lucky to have you.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I'm pretty awesome."
Fluttershy,"[straining] [gasping] I am so proud to be representing Ponyville. [straining] Oh, it's such an honor to even try out for the Games. I just hope I don't let anypony down."
Bulk Biceps,We'll make them proud!
Pinkie Pie,'P' is for 'proud'! We're gonna be the best fans anypony has ever seen!
Rarity,"Ooh. Can't wait to see what everypony else is wearing, even though I am absolutely sure they won't be better than the Ponyville uniforms I'm designing for the Equestria Games."
Applejack,And we will make it to the Games once everypony carbo-loads on my apple brown bettys.
Pinkie Pie,I can't wait!
Mane Moon,There's Rainbow Dash! She's an awesome flyer!
Orange Swirl,"I heard that she's flying the last third of the relay, which means everypony else is gonna have to be way ahead to beat her!"
Mane Moon,"Oh, the Wonderbolts!"
Sprinkle Medley,I hear they're flying for Cloudsdale.
Orange Swirl,Then Cloudsdale will definitely qualify. They're the best flyers ever.
Spitfire,And the game is on!
Soarin,"Hah, nice to see there's some real competition here!"
Fleetfoot,"Two more days of practice, then we'll see you in the air, Rainbow Dash! If you're lucky."
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] The Wonderbolts know a winner when they see one, and we'll be winners just as soon as we practice! Right team?"
Fluttershy,Right.
Bulk Biceps,Yeah!
Twilight Sparkle,"And, um, I'm with her! Hooray!"
Cloudsdale cheerleaders,Give us some clouds! Give us some dale! And what do you get? Cloudsdale! Woo-hoo!
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Where can I get pompoms like those?!
Rainbow Dash,"So, do I need to remind you of what our goal is here?"
Bulk Biceps,"Uh, maybe?"
Rainbow Dash,"We want to qualify! We need to be one of the first four teams to cross the finish line! Bulk Biceps, you're the first flyer, so let me see you flap it!"
Rainbow Dash,What the?
Applejack,"Sorry! Got the idea from them, but..."
Rainbowshine and Sprinkle Medley,Hooves down! Cakes up!
Applejack,...It looks like they got better aim.
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, the passing of the baton needs to be seamless. You shouldn't miss a wing beat or drop a hair in altitude! And whatever you do, don't let go of it!"
Fluttershy,"Are you really, really, really sure you're ready? I mean, I don't want to take it if you're not super sure."
Bulk Biceps,Ready!
Rarity,Ponyville could do so much better. I'll be back with a freshly painted one in no time!
Rainbow Dash,We were using that! And it's not like anypony else has color-coordinated horseshoes or anything!
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I guess some ponies do.
Twilight Sparkle,Some ponies do what?
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Have a better chance of qualifying and going to the Equestria Games than others.
Rainbow Dash,"Watch and learn. The Cloudsdales are Wonderbolts, and Wonderbolts are the best flyers there are. And my personal heroes. So, maybe you can learn something."
Rainbow Dash,Please learn something?
Fleetfoot,"C'mon, Soarin, pick up the pace! You can do better than that!"
Spitfire,I sure hope so.
Cloudsdale cheerleaders,"Practice, practice, yay, practice!"
Soarin,Whoa!
Soarin,Whooaaaa!
Soarin,Aaaaah! Help!
Rainbow Dash,Gotcha!
Fleetfoot,Awe-some!
Spitfire,As good as any Wonderbolt!
Fluttershy,"Oh, Rainbow Dash, I'm just so proud of you. You scooped Soarin out of the sky and brought him down to the ground and now, now he's okay. At least, I hope he's okay. [to Soarin] Are you okay?"
Soarin,"Uh, my wing hurts, but I-I'm sure it'll be okay by the competition."
Rainbow Dash,"Ah, it was nothin'. But, if you feel like talking about how great I am, don't let me stop you!"
Bulk Biceps,'P' is for Rainbow Dash!
Fluttershy,"[whispering] Um, 'Rainbow Dash' actually starts with an 'R'."
Bulk Biceps,Never mind!
Rainbow Dash,Tough break to lose a teammate right before the tryouts.
Fleetfoot,"You know, you grew up in Cloudsdale."
Spitfire,So that means you could fly with us.
Rainbow Dash,Fly?
Fleetfoot,"Uh, we mean practice. You could practice with us until Soarin's better."
Spitfire,What do you say? Wanna be our third?
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, I don't know. My team really needs me to be at my best in order to qualify. Don't wanna be too worn out by the time the race comes around."
Spitfire,We put you through some pretty intense workouts at the Wonderbolt Academy and you handled those just fine.
Rainbow Dash,"Heh, I did kick some major tail at the Academy... but I don't know how my teammates will feel about me practicing with the competition."
Fleetfoot,"Who says they need to know? Think about it, Rainbow Dash! This is your chance to fly with the winners!"
Rainbow Dash,"Alright, I'll do it."
Spitfire,"[chuckles] Wise decision, Rainbow Dash."
Fleetfoot,Awesome!
Cloudsdale cheerleaders,"Whinny, ponies, whinny! Fly on, fly on, fly on!"
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Bulk Biceps, you can do it!"
Fluttershy,"Um... I'm ready to take the horseshoe, if you want me to."
Rainbow Dash,Nnnngh...
Fluttershy,[yelps] Oof!
Rainbow Dash,"You, uh, keep doing your wing-ups. I'm just gonna get some, uh, water."
Bulk Biceps,[laughs] Yeah!
Rarity,Too much?
Twilight Sparkle,"It's not easy practicing with two teams, is it?"
Rainbow Dash,[spit-take] You... know? Does anypony else?
Twilight Sparkle,No. They're too busy practicing to wonder why you keep disappearing.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I've seen the other teams practicing and we're still gonna qualify. I can fly fast enough to make up the distance."
Twilight Sparkle,It just seems like one of the teams you're practicing with needs a little more help than the other one.
Rainbow Dash,"But it's so much more fun working out with the winners than... um... the non-winners. Besides, Ponyville will still qualify."
Spitfire,"Rainbow Dash, you got a minute?"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, sure."
Fleetfoot,"You could really be an asset to our team, so... we want you to join the Cloudsdale team. Permanently."
Spitfire,It looks like Soarin's wing won't heal in time for the trials. We want you to fly with us.
Fleetfoot,"Of course, this means you won't be able to fly for Ponyville, but let's face it. Even with you on their team, their chances of qualifying for the Games-"
Bulk Biceps,Ow!
Fleetfoot,-are pretty slim.
Spitfire,"So, what's it gonna be?"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I..."
Spitfire,Take some time to think about it.
Rainbow Dash,They want me to fly with them! It's like a dream come true!
Twilight Sparkle,"If you fly for Cloudsdale, Pinkie Pie won't have anypony to cheer for. Rarity's uniforms will never be seen. And Applejack will have slaved over those apple brown bettys for nothing."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, but I really wanna fly with the best team! What would you do?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I think this is a decision you have to make on your own. The race is tomorrow, so you'd better make it soon."
Rainbow Dash,[exaggerated groaning] Woe is me! Oooh!
Fluttershy,What's happened?
Rainbow Dash,"Urgh, I've hurt my hoof..."
Spitfire,All of them?
Rainbow Dash,"I, uh, tripped on a-a foam hoof and landed on a... [mumbles, near unintelligible] pokey stick coming out of the ground..."
Pinkie Pie,"[growls] If I get my hooves on that [matching unintelligible gibberish], it'll be in big trouble!"
Rainbow Dash,There is no way I can fly now.
Fluttershy,Do you think you'll be better by tryouts?
Rainbow Dash,[exaggerated groaning] I'll be lucky if I ever fly again! [sighs] I just need a little rest.
Fluttershy,"Oh, don't worry, Rainbow Dash. We'll take care of you... or, at least, somepony will. Like, a medic or-or a doctor, or a nurse."
Twilight Sparkle,"So, the medic pony isn't sure what's wrong with you."
Rainbow Dash,Everything! Absolutely everything!
Applejack,This'll cure everythin' that ails ya!
Rainbow Dash,[with mouth full] Thank you. I couldn't have done that on my own.
Rarity,Nothing says 'get better' like a little medical pizazz! Silk slings and a glitter bandage?
Rainbow Dash,That might help.
Fluttershy,And how is our patient doing?
Rainbow Dash,I've been better.
Fluttershy,"We just wanted to let you know that we're so sorry you're hurt, but you shouldn't worry a bit about not being able to be in the tryouts. We'll be alright. We even have a replacement. We're so, so sorry that you can't compete. We all know how much you love to fly. And we promise-"
Bulk Biceps,Cross our hearts!
Fluttershy,"...That if we qualify and make it to the Equestria Games and all win gold medals, you can have ours, because we know how much a gold medal means to you."
Rainbow Dash,Thanks...
Twilight Sparkle,[clears throat] I think Rainbow Dash might need to rest some more.
Applejack,Don't forget your bettys!
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, choosing not to choose isn't really a decision."
Soarin,"You sure have nice friends. Nopony's been by to visit me. Eh, too busy practicing, I guess."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, hopefully your wing will be better soon."
Soarin,"Oh, it's fine. I-I'm just keeping it warm in case my team wants me back."
Rainbow Dash,"What do you mean, 'wants you back'? Spitfire and Fleetfoot told me that you were still too injured to fly!"
Soarin,"And they told me that they were worried I wouldn't be one hundred percent by the tryouts, so they were going with somepony else!"
Rainbow Dash,"That somepony else was me! Until, uh, well, until I got hurt, that is."
Soarin,"So, [sighs] I guess we're all out of luck. Cloudsdale won't qualify without three fliers, and Ponyville won't qualify without you. Too bad..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Even with Rainbow Dash's replacement, I don't think we're gonna qualify. No offense."
Pinkie Pie,Gah! What am I gonna do with all these now?!
Applejack,"Uh, what were you gonna do with them before?"
Rarity,"[sighs] Maybe my Equestria Games uniforms will still be in style next year. I mean, I am pretty fashion-forward."
Twilight Sparkle,Is that Rainbow Dash... walking?
Fleetfoot,Does... this mean you're feeling better?
Rainbow Dash,"I-I feel great, because... I was never hurt in the first place."
Rainbow Dash,"I faked my injury so that I wouldn't have to choose between flying for Ponyville or Cloudsdale. I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to choose us. I know you love to win, and you should go with the team that surely will."
Rainbow Dash,I know now who I should've been loyal to.
Spitfire,Good choice. Always stick with the winners.
Rainbow Dash,"Ponyville. Because it's not just where I live, but it's where my friends are. The ponies who really care about me, whether I can help them win a race or not."
Spitfire,Are you sure that's the right decision?
Rainbow Dash,"You lied to me about Soarin's wing just so you could get a better flyer! You may be a winning team, but you're still not the kind of team I wanna be a part of."
Spitfire,"Huh. Rainbow Dash, you are something. Saw it at the Academy, seeing it again here. We could learn a lot from a competitor like you."
Fleetfoot,Think we already have.
Spitfire,Ready to fly?
Soarin,Really?
Spitfire,Never should've lied and tried to replace you to begin with.
Soarin,"[gasps] Go, Cloudsdale!"
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Ponyville relay team! We've got a race to get ready for!"
Bulk Biceps,Yeah!
Soarin,"Come on, Ponyville! You can do it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Go, Fluttershy! Woo-hoo!"
Cloudsdale cheerleaders,"Qualify, Ponyville! Qualify, Ponyville!"
Pinkie Pie,"Woo-hoo! Go, Rainbow Dash!"
Official,Ponyville qualifies!
Bulk Biceps,Yeah!
Main cast sans Rainbow Dash,Yeah!
Pinkie Pie,Woo-hoo!
Twilight Sparkle,"Equestria Games, here we come!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, I can't deny it. I love to win! But if I ever gotta choose between winning and being loyal to my friends, I'm always gonna choose my friends. 'Cause as much as I love winning, I love them waaaaay more."
Spike,Mail's here!
Twilight Sparkle,"Please be a yes, please be a yes, please be a yes... Yes! She can make it, she can make it!"
Spike,"Going out on a limb here, but I'm guessing that Princess Cadance said she can come this weekend!"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm finally gonna get to spend some quality time with my sister-in-law! This is the best news ever!
Fluttershy,"Um, so sorry for barging in like this... but I'm so excited, I just couldn't wait to tell somepony! The Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures have given me permission to observe the rarest, tiniest, most adorable magical creatures in all of Equestria <U+0096> the Breezies!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Fluttershy, that's fantastic!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, it's not just fantastic; it just might be the best news ever!"
Pinkie Pie,I just got the most incredible mail anypony's ever received in all of recorded pony postal history! It's a flyer about a one-day sale on used patio furniture! Aah! Could this day get any better? Woo-hoo!
Rarity,"Here's a wrap, in case it gets cold."
Applejack,And I packed you a basket of nice fresh apples in case you get hungry.
Twilight Sparkle,Have a great time!
Fluttershy,"Oh, I will. And I hope you have fun with Cadance."
Conductor,All aboard!
Fluttershy,"Goodbye! Goodbye, everypony!"
Pinkie Pie,"Fluttershy! I'll never forget youuuuuuu! [beat] Ooh, something floaty! La-la-la-la-la!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I'm a bit nervous about Cadance's visit!"
Applejack,"What could you be nervous about, Twilight? Cadance just loves you to pieces!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I know, but I really want her visit to go without a hitch!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, why wouldn't it?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, the last three times we've seen each other haven't exactly been worry-free."
Rarity,The fate of Equestria has hung in the balance during most of your visits with her.
Twilight Sparkle,Exactly. Cadance and I haven't really had a chance to just enjoy being friends again. Which is why it is so important that this visit be about the two of us having some real quality time together.
Applejack,I'm guessin' you've got a plan that'll keep it that way.
Twilight Sparkle,"The timing couldn't be more perfect. For one day only, right here in Ponyville, the Star Swirl the Bearded Traveling Museum! Cadance and I can spend the whole day looking at Star Swirl the Bearded artifacts!"
Rarity,Sounds like a perfect drama-free way to spend the day with Cadance.
Twilight Sparkle,Not counting the drama surrounding which of the bells from his cloak they've chosen to put on display. Spoiler alert: it's this one!
Rainbow Dash,"[hacks] Uh, sorry. Something in my throat... like a big ball of 'lame'!"
Rarity,I think it sounds delightful.
Applejack,"Yup, definitely sounds like you two will have some real quality time together."
Twilight Sparkle,Exactly. Just quiet time.
Princess Cadance,Your Highness.
Twilight Sparkle,Your Highness.
Princess Cadance,"I'm teasing, Twilight. We're sisters-in-law. We don't have to be so formal."
Princess Cadance,"Knowing you, you've made some plans."
Twilight Sparkle,"Boy, have I. Hang on just one second. [to rest of main cast] You guys-"
Rarity,"Now, now, don't you worry about a thing! We will make sure that nothing <U+0096> but nothing <U+0096> interferes with your visit."
Applejack,"Go on, have a hootenanny with your kinfolk."
Twilight Sparkle,"You really are the best friends a pony could ever have. Coming, Cadance!"
Pinkie Pie,"[sighs] Two sisters-in-law bonding. Well, I for one am gonna make sure that nothing spoils their day!"
Applejack,What is that thing?
Rarity,Whatever it is... duuuck!!!
Pinkie Pie,"Rarity, that doesn't look anything like a duck!"
Rainbow Dash,What is that?
Discord,"[sniffing] No, not a ""what"", but a ""who"", dear."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, no... That sounds like..."
Discord,[sneezes] [sniffs] Oh...
Others,"Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Discord!"
Applejack,What in tarnation are you doin' here? And why the jumpin' June bugs are you blue?
Rarity,"More like a shade of cerulean, to be precise."
Rainbow Dash,Whatever color you are is the color of trouble!
Applejack,"What are you, sick or somethin'?"
Discord,"Well, of course I'm sick. The blue skin? These sneezes? Could somebody find me a fainting couch?"
Rarity,What?
Rainbow Dash,"If you're so 'sick', why have you come here instead of, y'know, staying home in bed and getting over your weird illness?"
Discord,"[sneezes] [blows nose] Because this condition has left me helpless, simply helpless! Why, I can barely lift a spoon."
Discord,"I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health. Where is that dear, sweet Fluttershy? I need attention! I need some care! I need-"
Rainbow Dash,You need to chill. Fluttershy's out.
Discord,"Oh, of course, her trip to see the Breezies. Ah, yes, I had forgotten that was today."
Applejack,How do you know about her trip?
Discord,"Well, she told me about it in her last letter."
Pinkie Pie,You and Fluttershy write each other letters?
Discord,"Well, of course we do! We're friends! It's just such a shame that today of all days is when I really need her. Oh, well, I know what to do."
Rainbow Dash,"Good thinking. Head on home, put your feet up. I'm sure eventually you'll have the strength to make yourself soup or something..."
Discord,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no! I mean, while she's gone, you ponies can take care of me! Isn't that what friends are for, taking care of each other? [laughs] Let the healing begin!"
Rainbow Dash,Not it!
Pinkie Pie,"Don't you worry, Discord! I'll give you cuddles, and read you stories, and tell you all about me! I was born on a Tuesday-"
Applejack and Rarity,We did?
Discord,"I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, as a matter of fact, I most certainly- Hey! Who keeps throwing away these perfectly good balloons?"
Applejack,"[hushed] That joker's up to something, and whatever it is, we're gonna keep it as far away from Twilight and Princess Cadance as possible."
Rarity,"[hushed] You're right. We promised we wouldn't let anything ruin their visit... although I do so wish that ""anything"" had turned out to be something else!"
Discord,Did I hear you two talking about Princess Cadance's visit with Princess Twilight?
Applejack,Maybe.
Discord,"Fluttershy had mentioned that those two were getting together today. Mm-hm. How wonderful for them both. It is so rare that those two get to see one another. I don't know about you, but I sometimes wonder how close they could actually be. All those years apart before being reunited?"
Applejack,They're plenty close.
Discord,"And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless..."
Rarity,Don't even think about it! They mustn't be disturbed!
Discord,Disturb them? I wouldn't dream of it. Not when I have two such dear friends of my own who have already offered to take care of me. And at such peril! This flu of mine is highly- [snorts] [sneezes] contagious.
Twilight Sparkle,A whole day to celebrate Star Swirl the Bearded. What could be better?
Princess Cadance,Absolutely nothing. [gasps] Is that the candlestick he used to light the way when he was exploring the caverns of Maretania?
Twilight Sparkle,It sure is!
Princess Cadance,"Oh, I can't believe I'm getting to see it in real life!"
Twilight Sparkle,Discord! What are you doing here?!
Discord,"Oh, dear, dear Princesses, I'm sorry to say that I'm sick. [hacks] Blue flu."
Princess Cadance,Blue flu?
Princess Cadance,Magic health bubble.
Twilight Sparkle,Good thinking.
Discord,"Indeed. How would Twilight nurse me back to health if she were sick too? You will be letting me stay at your place until I'm all better, won't you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Stay? With me?! Uh, now is not really the best time, though I'm sure you already knew that..."
Discord,"But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're not my friend."
Twilight Sparkle,"[through gritted teeth] No, that is not what I'm saying."
Discord,"Oh, how elated I am to hear that. Shall the three of us head back to your place? I don't want to get anypony else sick."
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Guess we don't have much choice.
Discord,Carry me?
Princess Cadance,It isn't far. I think you can manage.
Discord,"Oh, poo."
Twilight Sparkle,Need anything else?
Discord,"Just knowing that I have a good friend like you to take care of me has made me feel better already. I'll be fine here on my own. Oh, just before you go, just a little small request."
Princess Cadance,It's going to be fine. We'll just get him what he wants and be back to the exhibit in no time. What was it that you needed?
Discord,A little glass of water please A fresh pressed hanky if I sneeze Some tea with honey from the bees Whenever you can brew it
Princess Cadance,I'll get your tea.
Discord,And while I get a little rest A teeny tiny small request Some codfish oil for my chest Poured from a crystal cruet
Twilight Sparkle,A crystal cruet?
Discord,"[singing faster] My goodness, I'm a nincompoop Because I fear I've got the croup I need a vat of pumpkin soup And scarves made out of zinnias"
Others,Did I say zinnias? I meant silk Or something shiny of that ilk And then I'll need some nice warm milk And pastries from Abyssinia
Others,"And since my stomach's feeling crummy Why not give my aching tummy Something soothing, something yummy Piled up with noodles?"
Others,Add a slice of homemade rye With stacks of Swiss way up high Served with sides of sweet mince pie More basil; I need oodles!
Twilight Sparkle,Anything else?
Discord,I'll be grateful for your charity Until the bitter end Because I've heard that tenderness Is what you lend an ailing friend
Others,"Tenderness, isn't that right, friend?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Right, but<U+0097>"
Discord,"So, who's ready for my big reprise?"
Others,"I'd like that glass of water please Some magic spell to cure disease A firm ""gesundhoof"" when I sneeze A fresh bouquet of roses"
Others,Some lozenges will soon appease My wheezing when I start to sneeze A wig to keep me from the breeze And blankets for my toes-es
Others,"Take tweezers out of my valise And then massage my knobby knees A bowl of peas, some extra cheese A cuddle with a Pekingese A singing harp who's named Louise A goat on skis, a new trapeze And more and more and more and more of these"
Others,And just because I oughta...
Others,"Make sure I'm drinking in the right Amount of fluids day and night I wish I may, I wish I might Have just one little thing Oh, would you please finally bring Me that tiny glass Of water?!!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Alright, this is ridiculous!"
Princess Cadance,How did you even catch this flu?
Discord,Inadequate hoof and claw washing?
Twilight Sparkle,There must be some way to just cure you! There has to be a spell or remedy in one of my books!
Discord,There is one way...
Princess Cadance,And you didn't think to mention it earlier?
Discord,"Slipped my mind. On a hill at the very edge of Equestria, there grows an exquisite magic flower. Pick the flower as it drops its petals at sunset. Then you can make a magical soothing elixir to cure the blue flu."
Twilight Sparkle,I suppose you have a good reason you didn't bother to get this flower as soon as you realized you were sick?
Discord,"Well, I couldn't travel that far in my condition. By the time I got there, I'd be too weak to even attempt to retrieve the flower."
Twilight Sparkle,So where exactly are Cadance and I headed?
Discord,"Well, [clears throat] you'll want to head north, turn left, th<U+0097> Oh... You know, it'd be much easier if I took you there myself."
Princess Cadance,I thought you were in no condition to travel.
Twilight Sparkle,Doing okay there?
Princess Cadance,"To be honest, I'm a little out of practice when it comes to flying."
Discord,"Well, then lucky for you. We're here."
Discord,It's just at the top of that hill.
Twilight Sparkle,I'm really sorry about this. All I wanted was to have some peaceful quality time together.
Princess Cadance,"I know, I was looking forward to it too."
Twilight Sparkle,"This is the top. But where is that flower? Oh. Come on, if we hurry, we can still have some time together."
Princess Cadance,One... last... pull!
Twilight Sparkle,"Phew! Let's get Discord and this flower back home, then all our problems are solved-"
Princess Cadance,What in Equestria?!
Princess Cadance,Twilight! Help!
Twilight Sparkle,Get your coils off my sister-in-law!
Princess Cadance,Let go of my sister-in-law!
Twilight Sparkle,Thanks!
Princess Cadance,Don't thank me yet!
Twilight Sparkle,Just... a little... more!
Princess Cadance,And for good measure...!
Twilight Sparkle,[panting] Are you okay?
Princess Cadance,[panting] Yes. Better than okay actually.
Twilight Sparkle,"Then let's get Discord back to Ponyville, make that elixir, and finally get a chance to spend some quality time together."
Twilight Sparkle,You... were... faking?!
Discord,I was! But I had a very good reason.
Twilight Sparkle,We're listening.
Discord,"Well, I was in my thinking tree <U+0096> that's where I do most of my really deep thinking <U+0096> I was there, and I said to myself, I said, ""Discord, your friend Twilight says that she's your pal, but she never writes and she never pops in for a visit."""
Twilight Sparkle,I don't even know where you li-
Discord,"""Now that she's a princess, maybe she's decided that she's too good for you."""
Twilight Sparkle,I have never considered myself t-
Discord,But how was I supposed to know for sure that I'm truly still friends with one of the most important ponies around?
Twilight Sparkle,I'm not more-
Discord,"By seeing if you would go to the ends of Equestria for me, of course. Which you did, literally. Congratulations, Twilight, you passed my friendship test!"
Discord,"Why the angry eyes? You love passing tests. It's not because my little exam put a damper on your visit with Princess Cadance, is it? Made it so that there was no time for you two to focus on your friendship?"
Princess Cadance,You didn't put a damper on our visit at all.
Princess Cadance,"Spending the day at the Star Swirl the Bearded exhibit would've been more relaxing, but to be honest, relaxation is the last thing I need."
Twilight Sparkle,It is?
Princess Cadance,"Don't get me wrong. Life in the Crystal Empire is wonderful, but it's become a little... predictable. I enjoy a little excitement now and then. Getting to face all these challenges today was just what I needed. And facing them with you just made me realize even more how lucky I am to have somepony like you as a friend. We may not see each other very often, but I know you'll always be there when I need you. Just like she was there for you, Discord."
Discord,"Yes, she's a real sweetheart. We're all so lucky to have her in our lives."
Discord,What in the world?!
Twilight Sparkle,"I think it's pretty clear that my visit with Cadance didn't go quite the way I expected. But in the end, I realized that when you're with a good friend, even the most chaotic day can end up being a great experience that brings you closer. Wouldn't you agree, Discord?"
Discord,"[snorts] Yes, Twilight."
Applejack,I don't wanna go sayin' you got what you deserved...
Rarity,"Well, I have no trouble saying it. You got what you deserved!"
Fluttershy,"Now, now, he's learned his lesson. Isn't that right, my little patient?"
Discord,"I'm so glad that you're back from your trip, Fluttershy. Just your presence here is making me feel so much better. I was just wondering, could I trouble you for just one more thing?"
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Discord,"What? I was simply going to ask for a teeny, tiny glass of water."
Cheese Sandwich,"Well, Boneless. Looks like our work here is done."
Cheese Sandwich,"Yep, those ponies never partied so hard. Thanks to me: Cheese. Cheese Sandwich."
Cheese Sandwich,"Woo-hoo-hoo! That was a doozy! Well, Boneless. Looks like our next party is gonna be in... Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie,"Every single day there's something new you can plan for Every single day there's something wonderful to do But nothing makes me happy like a day that I can say ""Today I planned a party, and it's just for you!"""
Vendor Pony,"How's it going today, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie,"Great, thanks! Got any streamers today?"
Vendor Pony,[chuckles] You betcha! Big party planned?
Pinkie Pie,Don't you know it!
Pinkie Pie,Don't have much time to gather all the things I need If I'm really gonna make this party fly For today's another day that all of Ponyville will say
Crowd,There goes the super party pony Pinkie Pie!
Others,[Mr. and Mrs. Cake] She planned our first foal shower where we played all sorts of games Having so much fun as we chose Pound and Pumpkin's names
Diamond Tiara,"She planned my cute-cea<f1>era my dad made me, I won't lie I demanded all the best, I suppose she passed the test Sure it was pretty good all thanks to Pinkie Pie"
Pinkie Pie,"Thanks, I guess?"
Art Vendor,What color paints do you need?
Pinkie Pie,I'm gonna need the full rainbow!
Art Vendor,A paintbrush too?
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, if you please!"
Peachy Pitt,And what from me?
Pinkie Pie,Your biggest banner! This party's gonna be the best!
Peachy Pitt,Haha I don't doubt it!
Crowd,"Every single day there's something new we can plan for Every single day there's something wonderful to try But nothing makes us happy like a day that we can say ""Today there'll be a party planned by Pinkie Pie!"""
Rarity,I don't know how she does it.
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, look at her go!"
Applejack,"Oh, boy! This is gonna be good!"
Fluttershy,"Go, Pinkie, go!"
Crowd,"There's no other pony like her, no pony that could be As great! (As great!) As fun! (As fun!) As our super party pony Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, I am so, so, SO excited because today I'm planning the birthday bash of... Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,Yeah!
Pinkie Pie,Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie,"You realize that, by enlisting me as your party planner, I guarantee that this is going to be the funnest, most fantabulous, superbial party in Ponyville?"
Rainbow Dash,Uh...yeah? I guess.
Pinkie Pie,No guesses! Parties are no picnic.
Fluttershy,"Oh, I like a nice picnic party."
Fluttershy,Oh!
Pinkie Pie,Parties. Are. Serious! And you have my certified Pinkie Party Promise that you will have the best birthday party ever!
Rainbow Dash,Okay.
Pinkie Pie,"Great! Now, who's ready to join this super duper party pony to plan this super duper pa-rty?"
Cheese Sandwich,I am.
Pinkie Pie,"Who are you, stranger?"
Cheese Sandwich,Name's Cheese Sandwich. I plan parties.
Pinkie Pie,"What an amazing coincidence! I'm Pinkie Pie, and I'm planning a party!"
Cheese Sandwich,"Oh, it's no coincidence, my little pony. My cheesy sense was a-tingling, telling me a party was in the works."
Pinkie Pie,A cheesy sense? Ah! Double amazing! I have a Pinkie Sense!
Cheese Sandwich,"Yes. I sensed you did. And I happen to be the premiere party planner in all of Equestria. If there's a party in need, there I'll be. Be it wingding, hoedown, hootenanny, or shindig, I'm your pony."
Pinkie Pie,A pair of party pony planners in Ponyville?! What can be more perfect?!
Rainbow Dash,I'll tell you what -- making this party epic! 'Cause this isn't just any birthday. It's also the anniversary of when I moved to Ponyville!
Rarity,"Good heavens, Rainbow Dash. It's your ""birth-iversary""!"
Rainbow Dash,"Exactly! So what do you say, party planners?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, I think we can do it!"
Cheese Sandwich,"Oh, I don't think so."
Cheese Sandwich,I know so! After all...
Cheese Sandwich,The super-duper party pony<U+0096>that pony is me I always knew that was the kind of pony I would be
Pinkie Pie,Me too!
Cheese Sandwich,"Come on, ponies! Who here likes to party? Ha-ha! You do! I can tell!"
Others,"When I was but a little colt, I just wanted to play"
Pinkie Pie,Like me!
Cheese Sandwich,"But everypony told me, ""Cheese, that fun just wastes the day"""
Pinkie Pie,As if!
Cheese Sandwich,But when I threw a party and I busted out some moves
Pinkie Pie,Uh-huh!
Cheese Sandwich,The ponies finally saw the light and got into the groove
Pinkie Pie,You know it!
Cheese Sandwich,The super-duper party pony<U+0096>that pony is me
Pinkie Pie,And me!
Cheese Sandwich,You'll never meet another party pony quite like Cheese!
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, Pinkie?"
Cheese Sandwich,"Hey, good-lookin', want some mayonnaise?"
Others,"My parties are all off the hook I never plan them by the book I start out fun, then whoopsie-daisy Everybody just gets crazy!"
Others,Bored of snacks made by your mom? How about a giant party bomb? Huge pi<f1>atas filled with cake Or dive into my fruit punch lake!
Goldengrape,Geronimo!
Cheese Sandwich,The super-duper party pony<U+0096>that pony is me You'll never meet another party pony quite like Cheese
Others,"C'mon, kid, take it for a spin!"
Colt,"Golly! Thanks, mister!"
Cheese Sandwich,"Oh, when I throw a Cheese party, be sure to not be lame And miss my pie fights, wacky kites, and streamers in your mane Fizzy drinks, Hawaiian shirts, and brie fondue delight You know that with Cheese Sandwich, you'll be partying all night!"
Rainbow Dash,"C'mon, everypony! Let's party down with Cheese!"
Fluttershy,You're really a certified party pony?
Cheese Sandwich,That's right! That's my guarantee!
Others,The super-duper party pony<U+0096>that pony is me-e-e-e-e
Pinkie Pie,But what about the super party pony named Pinkie...?
Cheese Sandwich,"[indistinct] Thanks buddy! You're gonna love this party! Hey kid, have a streamer, on me!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! Hah, now that's what I'm talking about! I'm so stoked you're here, Cheese Sandwich!"
Applejack,Yeah. You sure did come on the right day.
Rarity,[sighs] Your party sounds simply divine.
Twilight Sparkle,We're so lucky to have you here.
Cheese Sandwich,"Just doing my job, little fillies."
Rainbow Dash,"I mean, Pinkie Pie's parties are fun and sweet and all, but now this party's gonna be--"
Cheese Sandwich,Epic?
Rainbow Dash,"You said it! Oh, yeah!"
Cheese Sandwich,Feels gouda!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, heh, no offense, Pinkie."
Rainbow Dash,"My birth-iversary's already looking way cooler! You are my kind of party pony, Cheese Sandwich."
Cheese Sandwich,"[chuckles] You got that right, Rainbow Dash. All right, party ponies, I've got some planning to do!"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie! Aren't you gonna help Cheese Sandwich plan the party?
Pinkie Pie,That's okay. [chuckles nervously] He obviously has what it takes to do it all by himself. Heh.
Twilight Sparkle,Really?
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, indeedy! [chuckles nervously] After all, if Cheese really is the super duperiest partying-est pony of them all, maybe that means... I'm... not."
Pinkie Pie,"For all my life, all I've wanted to do Was make my friends want to smile true But maybe I was wrong And Pinkie Pie shouldn't plan parties at all"
Others,I'll try to get up on my hooves And try a different task I'll find something new to do There's gotta be more to me than planning a party or two
Others,"I put away my party cannon, I deflated all my balloons The bubbles all burst, now what is next for you? For you..."
Others,"Oh, my first party ever. My whole family was there. And that's Twilight's welcome-to-Ponyville party. She didn't even expect that one. [giggles] Oh, look at Gummy! He just looks so excited for this birthday party! Hmm. Shining Armor and Cadance's wedding sure was special, especially once I got a hold of the music."
Others,"Oh, look at those happy faces All the parties that I had thrown I made them laugh, had such a blast A smile that's all their own They loved seeing me, the real Pinkie Show them the time of their life like they've never known Like they've never kno-o-own"
Others,"I've got to get back out there, have to show them that I've tried For there's only one great party pony -- that is Pinkie Pie Won't let Cheese Sandwich beat me, won't let him get me down For I am Pinkie, the bestest party pony around!"
Applejack,"Well, they don't call him the super duper party planner for nothin'."
Pinkie Pie,That's it! This pony has gotta get her title back! And I know just what to do!
Rainbow Dash,Totally awesome!
Applejack,Huh. Best I've ever seen.
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe it!
Pinkie Pie,"Freeze, Cheese! I challenge you... to a goof off!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! Not a goof off!"
Applejack,[whispering] What's a goof off?
Fluttershy,"I have no idea, hehe."
Cheese Sandwich,"This Cheese has stood alone a long time, Pinkie Pie. You think you can out-goof me?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, I don't think so. I know so! And the stakes are high, Cheese Sandwich. Whoever wins will be dubbed the ultimate super duper party pony and headline the Rainbow Dash birth-iversary bash!"
Twilight Sparkle,And the loser?
Pinkie Pie,Doesn't!
Pinkie Pie,"So, are you in, Cheese? Or are you... boneless?"
Cheese Sandwich,"Nopony calls me boneless. Right, Boneless?"
Pinkie Pie,Then the goof off is on for high noon!
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, Pinkie? It's already 3 o'clock."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh. Oh, well then. Make it 3:10 to goof off!"
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, everypony. According to my official goof off rulebook..."
Rainbow Dash,She actually has a goof off rulebook?
Spike,Are you kidding? Twilight can find a rulebook for everything!
Matilda,Shhh.
Twilight Sparkle,"The two competitors have free range to goof about -- be it by singing, dancing, playing, prancing, joking, or performing -- to make the judge chortle, chuckle, giggle, guffaw, hoot and holler, whoop it up, and party down."
Twilight Sparkle,"The funnier, sillier, wilder, and goofier, the better. Rainbow Dash, since the winner will be headlining your party, you are the judge."
Rainbow Dash,Heh. Big tense competition on my birth-iversary. What could be better?
Twilight Sparkle,"Cheese Sandwich, Pinkie Pie, are you ready?"
Pinkie Pie,I was born ready!
Cheese Sandwich,I was ready before I was born!
Twilight Sparkle,Then... Let the goofing begin!
Pinkie Pie,"It's your birthday party, a very special day I've got a song, it won't take long, I just wanted to say Happy, happy, happy, happy Happy, happy, happy, happy Happy, happy, happy, happy birthday to you!"
Cheese Sandwich,"If you wanna be the life of the party But you're feeling just a little uptight Call the doctor, beg and plead ""Doctor, tell me what I need"" Try to put a little cheese in your knees!"
Pinkie Pie,"Bubbles and balloons, bubbles and balloons What's a birthday party without bubbles and balloons? Star-shaped or trapezoid, look what I can do Only Pinkie Pie can make a bubble shaped like you!"
Cheese Sandwich,"Just let yourself go floppy, for now this is your chance Pretend you have no bones and do the rubber chicken dance!"
Others,"Hit it, Boneless!"
Pinkie Pie,"Cooler than a rubber chicken and tastier than cake Come on, you, let's party down and do the Gummy shake!"
Others,"Hit it, Gummy! Uh-huh! You know it! Shake it!"
Cheese Sandwich,"'Cause I like to make you smile, smile, smile Yes I do It fills my heart with sunshine all the while Yes it does 'Cause all I really need's a smile, smile, smile From these happy friends of mine"
Pinkie Pie,That's my song!
Cheese Sandwich,What do you mean? I have no idea what you're talking about.
Pinkie Pie,THAT'S IT!
Pinkie Pie,Roll out the party cannon When you hear the party cannon song Ka-BOOM!
Cheese Sandwich,Why should you compromise? Try this one on for size 'Cause nothing quite says cheer like the ringing in your ear Of the cheese supreme cannonball surprise!
Pinkie Pie,"<U+00A1>Dale, dale, dale No pierdas el tino! Porque si lo pierdes <U+00A1>Pierdes el camino!"
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Rainbow's not having the best party ever! I... I broke the Pinkie Party Promise! Stop! The goof off is off!
Rainbow Dash,But I haven't named a winner.
Pinkie Pie,You don't have to. I forfeit. Which means... Cheese Sandwich wins.
Cheese Sandwich,[laughs] [sighs] ...I do?
Pinkie Pie,Yes. You get to headline Rainbow Dash's party.
Twilight Sparkle,"But, what about you, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie,I... [sniffles] I don't.
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie, wait! I'm sorry I got all swept away by Cheese Sandwich."
Twilight Sparkle,We all are.
Spike,"[sighs] Sorry, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,"No. I'm sorry I let my pride get in the way of you having the best birth-iversary ever. Cheese Sandwich really is a super duper party planner, and he'll be a terrific headliner. I should've been a big enough pony to admit that and let you have your day."
Rainbow Dash,"But don't you get it? You're both super duper party ponies. Sure, Cheese Sandwich is a great guest party pony, but you're Ponyville's permanent party pony. Nopony could ever take your place, and we could never have a party without you."
Cheese Sandwich,"Rainbow Dash is right. I never meant to take your place in Ponyville. I just wanted to show you what a great party pony I am, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,Why me?
Cheese Sandwich,Well...
Cheese Sandwich,"I fear I told a little fib about my pony past I hope that when you hear the truth, you will not be aghast I wasn't quite the super party pony like I claimed The fact is that I was so shy, nopony knew my name"
Others,"I stumbled into Ponyville one afternoon by chance And found the biggest ever celebration party dance Everything was perfect, cheer was filling up the place And I saw that everypony had a smile upon their face"
Others,"I vowed that day to change my life, the past I did set free For now Cheese Sandwich was a party pony full of glee A super duper party pony -- that's what I became I traveled all Equestria, and all did know my name"
Others,"But that never would have happened on my own, I'll tell you why For the one who threw that party, it was you, Pinkie Pie"
Pinkie Pie,Me?
Cheese Sandwich,Yes!
Pinkie Pie,"Hah, really?!"
Cheese Sandwich,Really!
Pinkie Pie,So I was the pony that threw the awesomely spectacular party that inspired you to become an awesome spectacular party thrower?
Cheese Sandwich,Swear on Camembert!
Rainbow Dash,"Enough with the warm fuzzy stuff, you two. It's my birth-iversary, and you gotta throw me a bash!"
Pinkie Pie,Yeah!
Cheese Sandwich,Let's go!
Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich,"Super duper party ponies -- that is me and you A party thrown by one is good, but not as great as two Come on and let's join forces, have twice the expertise Now let's all go to the party planned by Pinkie Pie and Cheese!"
Cheese Sandwich,"All right, everypony! We are here to celebrate the birthday..."
Pinkie Pie,...and anniversary...
Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich,...of Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, everypony! Who's ready to get their party on?! Hit it!"
Pinkie Pie,"Get your hooves up, party's starting out right now Everypony, everypony get down Time to make a wish, better make it right now It's been a year and today is your birthday party"
Others,"Make a wish, it's your birthday Make a wish, it's your birthday party Make a wish, it's your birthday Make a wish, it's your birthday party"
Rainbow Dash,"Cheese Sandwich! Oh, I gotta tell ya, you and Pinkie have totally made this the best birthday/anniversary super combo ever! Hah, it's totally--"
Cheese Sandwich,Epic?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, it is!"
Cheese Sandwich,"That's all I needed to hear, little filly. Just a little memento of my visit."
Pinkie Pie,You're giving me your special rubber chicken friend?
Cheese Sandwich,"Oh, he's not the only one. Well, Boneless Two, another job well done. But it's time we mosey along. Another town, another party."
Pinkie Pie,I never did get that pony's name.
Rest of main cast,Cheese Sandwich!
Pinkie Pie,"[giggles] Oh, yeah!"
Rainbow Dash,Wow! I can't believe how many ponies showed up!
Pinkie Pie,"I can! I mean, finding out who the Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies is is a pretty big deal!"
Twilight Sparkle,I didn't know Granny Smith was on the selection committee.
Applejack,"Of course she is. Ponyville Days celebrates the founding of Ponyville, and she was right there."
Pinkie Pie,I'm glad the committee didn't automatically pick me so everypony gets a chance to see how great being me actually is! Even though the festival's basically a party and the pony of ceremonies gets to organize the whole thing! So it'd totally make sense if they did pick me.
Ponies,Shhh!
Mayor Mare,"Citizens of Ponyville, this year's applicants were all exceptional, but there can only be one Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies. And that pony is..."
Mayor Mare,Rarity!
Applejack,"Whoo-ee! All right, Rarity!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Congratulations, Rarity! Do you know what you're gonna do?"
Rarity,"Oh, I might have a few ideas."
Pinkie Pie,"I'm so excited for the festival, I can hardly stand up straight!"
Twilight Sparkle,Me too. I'm glad Rarity was picked. I know she'll add a touch of elegance to the whole thing!
Applejack,Probably more than a touch!
Spike,"[clears throat] [reading] This year's Ponyville Days festival, designed by Rarity, will feature various high-class events such as... a silent cider auction and tasting."
Main cast sans Rarity,Ooooh!
Spike,A Ponyville gala in town square.
Main cast sans Rarity,Ahhhh!
Spike,"And, of course, a Ponyville fashion show."
Main cast sans Rarity,Ooooh!
Spike,This year's Ponyville Days festival pony of ceremonies creates shimmering couture of her own design.
Rarity,"And the theme is... ""Small Town Chic""!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Rarity. You really have put a lot of effort into this."
Applejack,I'll say.
Fluttershy,"Oh, I think it's going to be magical."
Rarity,[gasps] Do you really think so?
Pinkie Pie,Are you kidding? I can't wait!
Rarity,"Oh, that's such a relief. But of course, I couldn't possibly do it all on my own. The festival is in three days!"
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie Pie and I can hang lights and decorations in the town square!
Applejack,And I can get Sweet Apple Acres all ready for the cider tastin'.
Rarity,"Oh, that's just perfect! And now, Twilight, if you and Fluttershy wouldn't mind helping with the fashion show..."
Twilight Sparkle,Of course!
Fluttershy,I'd be honored.
Rarity,I can focus on the thing I'm worried about most of all.
Main cast sans Rarity,What?
Rarity,Creating a Ponyville Days festival fantastic enough to impress... Trenderhoof!
Applejack,"Uh, who's Trenderhoof?"
Twilight Sparkle,Sounds like somepony has a little bit of a crush.
Rarity,"Thank you ever so much for joining me, Twilight. I don't think I could have met Trenderhoof on my own!"
Twilight Sparkle,"It's no problem, but you shouldn't be nervous about meeting him."
Rarity,"Is that him? Is he here? Twilight, is he there?"
Twilight Sparkle,Uhh... I'm not sure.
Rarity,"You don't suppose he's decided not to come? Twilight, I don't see him! What if he doesn't arrive? The whole festival will be a disaster! Twilight, where is he?!"
Rarity,[clears throat] Sorry.
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, you have to get a hold of yourself. I mean, you haven't even met him yet!"
Twilight Sparkle,What's wrong?
Rarity,"Shh! [hushed, quickly] It's him, it's him, is it him? Is it him? It's him, he's here, he's here!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, go up and talk to him!"
Trenderhoof,"Please, call me 'Trend'."
Rarity,"And over here will be the climax of the festival, the Ponyville Days gala! Music, dancing! [laughs nervously] And of course a locally sourced menu of delicious treats."
Trenderhoof,"Reminds me of the ""Spring Fling meets Manehattan Wedding"" I wrote about in Gallop & Prance."
Rarity,"Exactly! I, I can't even describe how much your work has influenced me!"
Rarity,"And finally, Sweet Apple Acres. Ponyville's core, heh-heh, so to speak, where our quaint little hamlet began."
Trenderhoof,"Oh, breathtaking! I've heard about it of course, but to see it in v<e9>rit<e9>, to stand on the soil of a working farm... You can really feel the authenticity."
Rarity,"Oh, yes, uh, they, they really do grow apples here."
Trenderhoof,"Thank you, Rarity. Thank you for bringing me here. This farm is truly something special."
Rarity,"Oh, I had planned to transform it into an elegant country inn for the festival... but now I see just how special it is au naturel."
Trenderhoof,Au naturel indeed.
Trenderhoof,Who... is... that?
Rarity,Who? Applejack? Ahem! Why are you staring at her like that?
Trenderhoof,"I've seen a lot in my travels, but I've never beheld such beauty. Applejack... The pony of my dreams..."
Spike,Rarity? Rarity! Hello?
Spike,I brought my cider-tasting cup. Are you ready to go try the samples?
Rarity,[sobbing throughout] What's the point?!
Spike,"Rarity, what's wrong?"
Rarity,Nothing!
Spike,Is it something I said?
Rarity,He doesn't like me.
Spike,What?
Rarity,He doesn't like me.
Spike,"Rarity, I can't hear what you're<U+0097>"
Rarity,"He doesn't like me because he has a crush on Applejack, even though I've had a crush on him ever since the beginning of time, and it's not fair!"
Spike,Trenderhoof doesn't like you? That's ridiculous!
Rarity,"Oh, Spike, how could you ever know what it's like to be totally obsessed with a pony only to find out they're obsessed with somepony else?"
Rarity,"I mean, what could Applejack possibly have that I don't?!"
Spike,I 'unno.
Rarity,Hmm...
Trenderhoof,"You know, I have such respect for the work ethic of Earth ponies."
Applejack,"Uh, gee, thanks. Granny Smith always said, ""Pick an apple a day and keep trouble away."""
Trenderhoof,How many varieties of apples do you think there are?
Applejack,"Uh, on the farm or in all of Equestria? 'Cause<U+0097>"
Applejack,Is that a fact?
Trenderhoof,"That's my thing. I take the mundane, the simple, the unappreciated, and I make it relatable."
Applejack,"Well, I hope you can relate to Ponyville."
Trenderhoof,Me too. But enough about me. I wanna know about you! What do apples mean to Applejack?
Applejack,"Look, I'm glad you're interested in Ponyville 'n' all, but I'm kinda busy with my chores. And if I can't get 'em done, there won't be a Ponyville Days festival for you to write about."
Rarity,"Well, that will never do!"
Applejack,"Rarity, what are you wearin'?"
Rarity,"What, this old thing?"
Applejack,Aren't you too busy plannin' the festival to keep makin' new outfits for it?
Rarity,"I am. But the thought of hauling apples inspired me, and I just couldn't stop myself!"
Applejack,Really?
Rarity,"If there's one thing I love, it's hauling apples!"
Trenderhoof,[dreamily] I'm growing fond of it myself.
Applejack,[under her breath] Maybe you two should try it sometime.
Trenderhoof,"I'm feeling a tad inspired. Without farm life, there'd be such disparity These thoughts I think with great clarity Apples high to the sky She's the one of my eye That fruit-hauling pony named... Applejack!"
Spike,"Rarity, why do you want to plow a field?"
Rarity,"Is it me, or could this use a splash of color? And maybe a wash!"
Spike,Don't we need to check on the gala decorations?
Rarity,"Yes, yes, of course, but Trend obviously has a thing for farm life. If I can't convince him that I'm just as much of a farm hoof as Applejack, I'll never get him interested in the festival."
Spike,The festival. Right.
Rarity,"And I do appreciate your help ever so much. I couldn't do a thing without you, Spikey-poo."
Spike,"Well, that's what friends are for!"
Rarity,"Right, so. [whips reins] Come on! [grunts] Farm... thing! [sighs] Oh, how does Applejack do it?"
Applejack,"Well, it would help if the harness was on right! What are you doin'?"
Rarity,"I am simply lending a hoof with the chores, which I love doing ever so much."
Applejack,"Well if you're still interested after the festival I can teach you all about it. But right now, I need to get the plowin' done, if you don't mind."
Rarity,Not at all. Ugh! Oh!
Spike,She makes it look so easy.
Trenderhoof,[dreamily] I know. Isn't she fantastic?
Rarity,I really don't see what the fuss is all about.
Applejack,"Now, Rarity, you be careful. If you don't get the buckin' just right, you could sprain a hoof."
Rarity,"I am perfectly familiar with the apple-bucking process, thank you very much. But while you seem to rely on raw power, I believe a certain amount of style is required. It's really more of a dance, if you ask me. [happy 'hm'ing noises] Et voil<e0>!"
Applejack,"Well, your way is definitely long on style."
Rarity,Thank you.
Applejack,"Now, if you'll all excuse me, I have some more chores to do. Inside!"
Trenderhoof,"Rarity, can I ask you something?"
Rarity,"Oh, why, Trend, you can ask me anything."
Trenderhoof,"I've been meaning to ask for a while, and frankly I'm sort of embarrassed. Rarity... do you think... Applejack would be my date for the festival?"
Rarity,Why don't you go ask her yourself?! Hmph!
Applejack,"Whew! Well, that was close."
Rarity,"If you've come to apologize, there's really no need."
Applejack,What are you talkin' about?
Rarity,"Let's dispense with the charade, shall we?"
Applejack,"Listen, I know you really want Trend to like you<U+0097>"
Rarity,And he does! Despite somepony's best efforts!
Applejack,I swear I don't know why he's payin' so much attention to me. And I don't know anypony who's that interested in farmin'. Not even me!
Rarity,"Well, maybe it's time Trend met a real country pony."
Applejack,Shouldn't you be workin' on the festival instead of comin' up with new ways to impress Trend?
Rarity,"Oh, I'm sure you'd love that. Well, I have a new vision for the festival, [in country accent] and it's gonna be more country than the whole Apple family put together!"
Fluttershy,"Um, isn't it a little late to be changing the theme?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, what's going on?"
Applejack,I'm too scared to guess.
Rarity,"[country accent] Firstly, I just want to thank you all for comin', and second, I know y'all will all adore my new festival theme!"
Rarity,"[country accent] ""Simple Ways""!"
Rarity,[country accent throughout] Well? What's so funny?
Applejack,"Rarity, that is the silliest getup I have ever seen!"
Fluttershy,It is a little funny.
Rarity,Fun-nay?
Twilight Sparkle,"[laughing] Rarity, you aren't serious, are you?"
Rarity,[normal voice] Well of course I'm serious<U+0096> [clears throat] [back in country accent] Why wouldn't I be?
Applejack,Because you would never dress like that. You like fashion and high society and fancy things.
Rarity,And I can like plowin' fields and haulin' apples just as much.
Applejack,But you don't!
Rarity,How do you know what I like?
Applejack,Because I know you.
Rarity,"Wail, maybe you don't know me as well as you thank."
Applejack,"And I suppose it's just a coincidence that Trenderhoof seemed so interested in country life, too?"
Rarity,I don't know what you're gittin' at!
Applejack,"Well then, I guess I'll just have to show you!"
Rarity,"Be my guest! Now, if you all will excuse me, I have a hootenanny of a festival to put on."
Rarity,"[country accent throughout] Now, to be a model in the Simple Ways fashion show, you might think ""simple"" means ""less is more"". Well, that just ain't so. If you want to be real simple, more is more. Now, y'all go off and make yourselves look just like that. [to Spike] Who's our next model for the fashion show?"
Spike,Um... Apple... Jewel?
Rarity,Who the hay is that?
Rarity,Is this some kind of joke?
Applejack,"[upper-class accent throughout] Why, Rarity, whatever would make you think I was joking?"
Rarity,[normal voice] Because you would never wear an ensemble like that. You like plowing fields and hauling apples<U+0097>
Applejack,And I can like fashion just as much.
Rarity,[back in country accent] But you don't!
Applejack,"Well, maybe you do not know me as well as you think."
Rarity,"Fine. But I got a whole festival to plan, so if you're goin' to start modelin', just get on with it!"
Applejack,"Life is a festival, and you should celebrate it by looking just like me! Because I'm a trend-setting fashionista!"
Applejack,"Oh, is that so?"
Rarity,"Yes, indeedy-doodle!"
Applejack,[gasp] Not me! My mane needs to be perfectly coiffed at all times.
Rarity,"Well, my mane is full of dust and split ends."
Applejack,"My hooves are so polished, you can see your reflection in them."
Rarity,My hooves are cracked and dry from working in the fields!
Applejack,I'm so fashion-forward.
Rarity,I wear droopy drawers!
Applejack,I smell like rosebuds.
Rarity,I love being covered in mud!
Rarity,"[normal voice] Goodness! Your couture! Ooh, it's bad. Will somepony bring me a towel to wipe this repulsive filth from my hooves?!"
Applejack,[normal voice] There's the Rarity I know!
Rarity,"Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry I said all those things. You're a true friend who probably knows me better than I know myself. I don't know what I was thinking wearing this ridiculous outfit."
Applejack,I kinda know how you feel.
Rarity,"Oh, but you were just trying to help me see how silly I was being. And you were right. [sighs] Besides, that gown looks just gorgeous on you. I wish I hadn't ruined it."
Applejack,"Thanks! It's nice, ain't it?"
Rarity,It's magnificent! Wherever did you get it?
Applejack,"Oh, it's, uh, one of yours."
Rarity,"I'll need three gallons of boiling water and one ounce of detergent, stat!"
Trenderhoof,"[clears throat] I'm moving to Ponyville! Being the most interesting pony in Equestria is exhausting. I want to leave my exotic, exciting life behind and live on a farm!"
Applejack and Rarity,What?!
Applejack,"Well, that's real nice, but I sure hope you weren't thinkin' of Sweet Apple Acres."
Trenderhoof,Oh.
Applejack,"Uh, look, you're a fine pony, but, uh, well, I'm, uh..."
Rarity,"I think what Applejack is trying to say is that there's something unappealing about a pony who'd change themselves so much just to impress somepony else. If somepony doesn't like you for who you are, it's their loss."
Trenderhoof,"Well, this is awkward."
Rarity,"Not at all. In fact, I think I know just how you feel."
Applejack,"What do you think, Rarity? Is it too late to go back to ""Small Town Chic""?"
Rarity,Not if I can help it!
Rarity,"Organizing the Ponyville Day celebration was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I learned an important lesson. Real friends will like you for who you are, and changing yourself to impress them is no way to make new ones. And when you're as fabulous as I am, it's practically a crime!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, good morning, little friends. Your singing is oh-so pretty."
Fluttershy,"Yes, it is a very beautiful day today. Certainly something worth singing about."
Fluttershy,"Oh, thank you so much. [giggles] You're too kind."
Pinkie Pie,Wow!
Fluttershy,Oh... You... um... you didn't hear me... um...
Pinkie Pie,Singing in the most beautiful voice ever?!?
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, yeah, we did!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, I've never heard you sing a solo like that before!"
Applejack,It was like a little slice of heaven.
Pinkie Pie,With ice cream on top!
Rarity,"Fluttershy, I cannot believe your spectacular voice isn't part of the Pony Tones quartet!"
Fluttershy,"Um, well, I<U+0097>"
Rarity,Especially since you're having us perform for your Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser tomorrow night!
Fluttershy,"Well, you see, I<U+0097>"
Rarity,This simply must be rectified. You must share that stunning voice at the event!
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! It'll be so amazing! You'll be there on stage, basking in the hooflights! The center of attention! A shining star! Everypony staring at you, judging you, jealously noting how they could be way better than you! Why wasn't it them? Why wasn't it them? And then, when you choke, they'll turn on you, becoming a seething, angry mob, and you'll be horribly humiliated, never able to show your face in Ponyville again!"
Rarity,Pinkie Pie!
Rarity,Don't be ridiculous!
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, but I'm so good at it!"
Rarity,"[sighs] Come, Fluttershy, you will join the group, making the Pony Tones quartet the Pony Tones quintet!"
Fluttershy,No.
Rarity,Pardon me?
Fluttershy,"I love the Pony Tones, I'm one of their biggest fans, but I do not want to perform with them."
Twilight Sparkle,"Why not, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy,"Well, you see... I... I have... um... I... I have..."
Rainbow Dash,Spit it out!
Fluttershy,I have... stage fright.
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Is it contagious?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Stage fright isn't a disease, Pinkie. It just means that Fluttershy is scared to perform in front of everypony."
Fluttershy,"I'm very thankful the Pony Tones are singing at the Pet Center fundraiser, and I'm really looking forward to the performance, but I'll be watching safely from the audience."
Rarity,"[sighs] Well... I think it's a terrible waste of an exquisite talent, but I understand that you're not comfortable."
Fluttershy,Thank you. Oh! Angel's right. We'd better get going. There's a lot of work to do before tomorrow's event.
Big McIntosh,"Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah"
The Pony Tones,"Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah) Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah)"
Big McIntosh,Everypony's sayin' you should learn to express your voice But if talk doesn't seem like it's the answer
The Pony Tones,"Luckily you have a choice When you find you've got the music ( Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music) Got the music in you (Rarity: Oh, you) Find you've got the music (Rarity: Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music) Got the music in you"
Spike,"Woo-hoo, yeah! Rarity, you were awesome!"
Rarity,"Uh, thank you, Spike, but this is an ensemble."
Spike,"Eh, the rest of you were pretty good too."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I thought you were all amazing, Pony Tones!"
Torch Song,"Thanks, Fluttershy!"
Rarity,"Now, Pony Tones, I want you all to rest your voices for the remainder of the day. We'll do a final run-through tomorrow before the big event, alright?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Torch Song,Sounds great!
Fluttershy,"Oh, Rarity, the Pony Tones are really gonna make the Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser so special. Thank you so much for helping me help the animals."
Rarity,"Oh, yes. It is wonderful when a plan comes together without any sort of drama, isn't it?"
Torch Song,"Morning, Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy,"Good morning, Pony Tones!"
Rarity,"Actually, we're the Pony Tones minus one tone. Big Mac is inconveniently late."
Rarity,Big Mac? Can you please start the song?
Big McIntosh,[croaking] Nope.
Rarity,Big Mac! Did you lose your voice?
Big McIntosh,[gulps] [croaking] Eeyup.
Rarity,Whatever did you do to cause this?
Big McIntosh,[croaking] Well...
Applejack,"[through microphone] Howdy, everypony, and welcome to the twelfth annual Ponyville turkey call!"
Applejack,Who will take the title this year? Will it be somepony new? Or will the turkey call champion of six years defend his title to make it lucky number seven?
Granny Smith,We'll find out if you stop your gabbin' and get on with the gobblin'!
Applejack,"Alright, everypony! Let's talk turkey! Big Mac, you're up!"
Rarity,A...a...a turkey call? You lost your voice doing a... a turkey call?!
Rarity,Now we can't perform tonight!
Fluttershy,"Wait, what? No! You have to perform! Otherwise, the fundraiser will be a disaster!"
Rarity,"Well, we cannot perform tonight with only three voices."
Fluttershy,Why not?
Rarity,"It would take rearranging all the music, and we just don't have time. I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I have no remedy for this situation."
Fluttershy,[gasps] Of course! A remedy! Follow me!
Zecora,Hmmm.
Big McIntosh,[croaking] Ahhhh.
Zecora,Hmmm.
Big McIntosh,[croaking] Ahhh<U+0097>
Zecora,"I can cure this pony that is hoarse, but it will take a longer course."
Rarity,"Uh, come again?"
Zecora,"Mm. I can mix a brew that can work just right, but it cannot heal him by tonight."
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! Ah! Where are we ever going to find a deep voice to replace Big Mac's?"
Rarity,"Pardon me, Zecora, but this is no laughing matter! We need a bass voice for the harmonies to work! Without it, the performance will be ruined!"
Zecora,"Please, forgive my strange elation, but I was not laughing at your situation."
Rarity,Then what?
Zecora,"Remember when you pony folk stumbled into poison joke? Miss Fluttershy had an unusual change, deepening her vocal range."
Fluttershy,"[from Bridle Gossip, deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it."
Rarity,"Yes, yes! Your voice became really low, making it sound like..."
Fluttershy,[gasps] Flutterguy!
Zecora,"With these leaves I can mix a brew, creating the same effect on you."
Rarity,"Zecora, that's fantastic!"
Fluttershy,Yes! I'll do it! I'd do anything for the animals!
Rarity,"Why, you'd even appear on stage!"
Fluttershy,Oh. Except that. I just can't bring myself to sing on stage in front of everypony.
Rarity,What if you sang not in front of everypony?
Fluttershy,Huh?
Rarity,"What if Big Mac was onstage, moving his lips while you're behind the curtains singing his part? It would be just like singing in your house! Nopony would know it was you!"
Fluttershy,"Even still, I just don't think I could sing in front of..."
Rarity,You must! For the animals!
Fluttershy,Oh... Okay then... [gulps] Mix it up!
Rarity,"[hushed] Now, do it just like we practiced!"
Rarity,"Good evening, citizens of Ponyville! I want to thank you all for coming out tonight and generously supporting the Ponyville Pet Center! Thanks to your kindness, pets are finding loving homes, and we're sure to meet our fundraising goal!"
Twilight Sparkle,Where's Fluttershy?
Applejack,Probably hidin'. You know how much that pony hates the spotlight.
Rarity,"So, with no further ado, please welcome the Pony Tones!"
Others,"[Fluttershy (male voice)] Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah"
The Pony Tones,"Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah) Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah) Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah) Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah)"
Others,[Fluttershy (male voice)] Trot outside and you see the sunshine Something's in the air today Sky is clear and you're feelin' so fine Everything's gonna be a-okay
Others,[Toe-Tapper and Torch Song] If you listen carefully On every corner there's a rhythm playing
Others,[Toe-Tapper and Rarity] Then it happens suddenly The music takes you over and you'll
The Pony Tones,"Find you've got the music ( Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music) Got the music in you (Rarity: Oh, you) Find you've got the music (Rarity: Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music) Got the music in you"
Others,"[Fluttershy (male voice)] Oh, o-o-oh Everypony's sayin' you should learn to express your voice But if talk doesn't seem like it's the answer"
The Pony Tones,"Luckily you have a choice When you find you've got the music ( Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music) Got the music in you (Rarity: Oh, you) Find you've got the music (Rarity: Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music) Got the music in you"
Others,"Got the music, got the music in you!"
Crowd,[cheering] Pony Tones! Pony Tones!
Twilight Sparkle,Pony Tones! That was truly amazing!
Applejack,"And you sounded better than ever, big brother!"
Pinkie Pie,"Fluttershy, you were on the wrong side of the curtain! You totally missed the show!"
Rarity,"Uh, just like a true professional, Fluttershy was backstage making sure everything ran smoothly! [hushed, to Fluttershy] And it was perfect."
Nightjar,"That was fantastic, Pony Tones!"
Zipporwhill,My new puppy and I thought it was super-duper crazy good!
Rarity,"Why, thank you!"
Nightjar,And we were wondering if you would consider performing at my daughter Zipporwhill's cute-cea<f1>era.
Zipporwhill,Will you? Will you?
Rarity,We'd love to! When is it? Next week? Next month?
Nightjar and Zipporwhill,Tomorrow!
Rarity,"Oh, gracious, I'm terribly sorry, but that's much too last minute."
Zipporwhill,"Oh, no..."
Nightjar,Well... I understand.
Fluttershy,"[deep male voice] Oh, Rarity, we can't disappoint that sweet little filly."
Rarity,[hushed] Are you sure you're up for it?
The Pony Tones,When you find you've got the music Got the music in you Find you've got the music Got the music in you
Others,"Got the music, got the music in you!"
Zipporwhill,"Whoo, yeah, alright! We got the Pony Tones, we got the Pony Tones!"
Mayor Mare,"Amazing, Pony Tones! And it would be even more amazing if you could perform at my ribbon-cutting ceremony tomorrow!"
Rarity,"Oh, Mayor, we would love to, but... [clears throat] Would you excuse us for a second, Mayor?"
Mayor Mare,Certainly.
Rarity,"[hushed] Don't worry, Fluttershy, you don't have to perform again."
Fluttershy,[deep male voice] But we wouldn't want to disappoint the Mayor.
Rarity,"Well, then... Mayor? The Pony Tones will happily perform at your ceremony!"
Others,[Fluttershy (male voice)] Trot outside and see the sunshine Something's in the air today Sky is clear and you're feelin' so fine Everything's gonna be a-okay
Fluttershy,[deep male voice] We wouldn't want to disappoint the spa patrons.
The Pony Tones,If you listen carefully On every corner there's a rhythm playing Then it happens suddenly The music takes you over and you'll
Fluttershy,[deep male voice] We wouldn't want to disappoint the schoolponies.
The Pony Tones,"Find you've got the music Find it in your heart, you can Find it, oh yeah Got the music in you now"
Others,"Got the music, got the music in you!"
Rarity,"Fluttershy, we must talk to you. Big Mac's voice is all better!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Rarity,Now you can bathe in the poison joke antidote and sound like your lovely self again.
Fluttershy,[deep male voice] It's just... I didn't know that last performance was my last performance.
Rarity,"Fluttershy, stop! Ohhh... [to Big McIntosh] Would it be okay if Fluttershy sang for you one last time?"
Big McIntosh,Hmm. Eeyup.
Others,"[Fluttershy (male voice)] Hey, find it, oh why, you can find it In your heart, yeah, find the music, yeah It's in you right now! Oh, yeah! You can find the music!"
Others,"[Fluttershy (male voice)] Yeah, yeah, I love the music, ye<U+0097>"
Rest of main cast,Fluttershy?!
Applejack,"Big Mac, you got some 'splainin' to do! [beat] Turkey call?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,Trash your voice?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,Zecora remedy?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,Not quick enough?
Big McIntosh,Nnope.
Applejack,Needed a deep voice?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,Poison joke?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,Flutterguy?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,Better now?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,And that shy filly was livin' her dream in the shadows because she couldn't bring herself to come into the spotlight?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,"Well, for corn's sake! Let's go!"
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy? You in here?
Fluttershy,[normal voice] Yes... I'm here.
Pinkie Pie,"That was totally unbelievable! I mean, the curtain came up and there you were, singing in front of everypony! And you know, I don't think anypony was jealous, 'cause there certainly wasn't an angry mob! But it must have been horrible standing there on stage, all eyes glued directly on you! It's like you were living your own personal worst nightmare!"
Fluttershy,[crying] It was.
Pinkie Pie,What? Too much?
Twilight Sparkle,What Pinkie meant to say is that you were really great!
Pinkie Pie,Wait! Didn't I say that?
Rarity,Hardly!
Pinkie Pie,Whoops. You were great!
Rainbow Dash,You totally blew my mind!
Applejack,Incredible!
Pinkie Pie,"Though, no offense... you kind of sounded like a dude."
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, a great-sounding dude!"
Fluttershy,"Well, thank you all. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Because I'm never going to sing in front of anypony ever again."
Pinkie Pie,Are you kidding me?!
Rarity,Can we please stop running?
Rarity,"I just don't understand why, Fluttershy. After all, you're the one that wanted the Pony Tones to sing for every silly thing that was requested of us."
Fluttershy,"You mean, you knew I really wanted to perform?"
Rarity,Of course I knew!
Fluttershy,Oh...
Rarity,"And, for all her babbling, Pinkie Pie was right about one thing."
Pinkie Pie,Only one?!
Rarity,"When that curtain fell, and everypony saw you singing, you lived your worst nightmare! Was it really that bad?"
Fluttershy,Yes!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, what was so bad about it?"
Rainbow Dash,The thunderous applause?
Applejack,The praise for your fantastic singin'?
Pinkie Pie,The screaming fans?!
Fluttershy,There's music in the treetops And there's music in the vale And all around the music fills the sky There's music by the river And there's music in the grass And the music makes your heart soar in reply
The Pony Tones,When you find you've got the music
Fluttershy,You've got to look inside and find
The Pony Tones,Find you've got the music
Fluttershy,The music deep inside you
The Pony Tones,Find you've got the music
Fluttershy,"'Cause when you look inside, you'll see it"
The Pony Tones,Find you've got the music
Fluttershy,"You're gonna find it, gonna find"
The Pony Tones,"You've got the music Got the music, got the music Got the music in you!"
Rainbow Dash,"You did it, Fluttershy!"
Applejack,See? That wasn't so bad.
Pinkie Pie,And you didn't look completely petrified by the fact that we're all staring at you at all!
Twilight Sparkle,How do you feel?
Fluttershy,Surprisingly... okay!
Rarity,"Fantastic, because the Pony Tones have been booked for the Apple Family Zap Apple Jam Extraordinaire!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, no... I couldn't do that!"
Applejack,How come?
Fluttershy,"I'll get there someday. But for now... baby steps, everypony. Baby steps."
Fluttershy,"Sometimes, being afraid can stop you from doing something that you love, but hiding behind these fears means you're only hiding from your true self. It's much better to face those fears so you can shine and be the best pony you can possibly be."
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, Sweetie Belle, maybe we should run through the steps another few times before you try it on your own."
Sweetie Belle,Nope. Ready to give it a shot!
Twilight Sparkle,Okay then!
Sweetie Belle,[straining] Can't... seem... to...! [straining] [neck clicks] Ugh! Think I threw my neck out...
Scootaloo,"Aw, you're okay."
Apple Bloom,A little more magic practice and liftin' brooms'll be a cinch!
Sweetie Belle,I doubt it. That thing weighs a ton.
Sweetie Belle,Hmph. I'll never get my cutie mark for this...
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe not. But I'm happy to keep helping you learn just for the fun of it as long as you like.
Spike,"Hey, who's gonna clean up this mess?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Scootaloo, I already told you I won't show you how, but I'll help you find the instructions so you can figure it out yourself."
Scootaloo,"Ugh, I hate research!"
Twilight Sparkle,"To your left, third shelf from the bottom. You'll find it in no time."
Apple Bloom,"Thanks so much for helpin' us all learn these new skills, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,Always glad to pass on my love of learning for learning's sake.
Apple Bloom,Only I'm afraid I'll never get the hang of this potion-makin'.
Twilight Sparkle,Did you follow the magic plant-growing formula I gave you?
Apple Bloom,Well... uh... more or less.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, let's try it out on this apple seedling and see how we do."
Apple Bloom,Oh... I hope this works.
Apple Bloom,"Layin' it on a little thick there, aren't we, pal?"
Diamond Tiara,Yoo-hoo! Gather 'round! It's time!
Diamond Tiara,"As you all know, I had promised to put on an amazing, first-time-ever acrobatic display for you all today!"
Diamond Tiara,"I know, it's so exciting. But I'm tired."
Foals,Awww...
Diamond Tiara,"But I did not wish to disappoint you all, so I brought my butler Randolph to do them for me."
Silver Spoon,"That was amazing, Diamond Tiara."
Diamond Tiara,I know. I don't know how I do it.
Apple Bloom,I can't believe she gets so much attention without even really doing anything!
Scootaloo,"She's using somepony else to build herself up, and without even putting any effort to learn her own skills like we do!"
Sweetie Belle,"Hey, come to think of it, if we get really good at the stuff Twilight's teaching us, we could be the big shots around here for a change! Hmm..."
Scootaloo,Check this out!
Apple Bloom,And check this out!
Sweetie Belle,Now check this out!
Diamond Tiara,"[yelping] Hey, put me down!"
Diamond Tiara,"Hey, can you hear me?"
Sweetie Belle,Huh? Huh? What? What?
Diamond Tiara,I was asking if your sister Rarity will be taking you to Manehattan anytime soon.
Silver Spoon,"Because if she is, maybe you can meet up with us while we hang out with a bunch of famous celebrities."
Scootaloo,Cool!
Apple Bloom,"Wow, that's... pretty nice of you guys."
Sweetie Belle,"Actually, my sister hasn't offered to take me to Manehattan anytime soon."
Diamond Tiara,"Yeah, we figured."
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, yeah?! Well, I don't have to go all the way to Manehattan to hang out with the famous and super-cool ponies! Me and my friends hang out with Princess Twilight all the time!"
Diamond Tiara,D-did you say Princess Twilight?! You hang out with her all the time? For real?
Apple Bloom,More like just once a week.
Scootaloo,She helps us learn cool new stuff to do! That we actually do ourselves!
Diamond Tiara,You must bring me along next time you go!
Silver Spoon,Bring us along!
Diamond Tiara,"I mean, we used to see her around town all the time, and I thought, ""whatever""..."
Silver Spoon,Me too. I thought that.
Diamond Tiara,"But now she's a princess, which makes her totally awesome!"
Silver Spoon,"Plus, she has wings."
Diamond Tiara,And she's an Alicorn. So can I<U+0096>
Silver Spoon,We!
Diamond Tiara,<U+0096>go?
Apple Bloom,I don't think we should<U+0096>
Sweetie Belle,Would you two excuse us for a moment? We should totally say yes! This is a golden opportunity!
Apple Bloom,Are you kiddin'? I don't want them laughing at us while I'm mixin' potions and accidentally sendin' plants into chokin' fits!
Sweetie Belle,But don't you get it? They'll have to learn something too!
Scootaloo,And they won't be able to laugh at us when they're so busy trying to learn stuff of their own.
Apple Bloom,I must admit it's kinda fun to see them workin' hard to get on our good side for a change.
Diamond Tiara,"Oh, my gosh! A princess lives in there! And I'm about to go inside and see her! I can't even tell you how excited I am!"
Silver Spoon,I can't either!
Sweetie Belle,"Now remember, Twilight takes this time out with us so we can learn stuff."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey there, guys! Come on in!"
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon,[squealing] Princess Twilight!
Diamond Tiara,"Oh, it's really her!"
Silver Spoon,"Oh, my gosh, I don't believe it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, and, uh, you brought guests. Great!"
Diamond Tiara,"Princess Twilight, it is such a thrill and honor to be here! You have no idea. Oh my gosh, who dyes your tail?"
Silver Spoon,I so have to get that done.
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, it's not dyed. I've always<U+0096>"
Diamond Tiara,[gasp] Are those books in there? What a bold design choice!
Silver Spoon,"You should so do that, Di!"
Diamond Tiara,"I know, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Listen, I'm all for helping as many ponies as I can, but maybe we should keep these weekly visits just between us, hm? Okay, which one of you wants to practice first?"
Sweetie Belle,Shouldn't they go first?
Twilight Sparkle,"No, silly! I set up Twilight Time especially for you. Apple Bloom, go ahead. Let's see how your plant potions are coming."
Apple Bloom,I can't believe I let you talk us into bringin' guests yesterday.
Scootaloo,"I didn't hear them laugh at us once, Apple Bloom."
Apple Bloom,'Cause they laughed on the inside.
Sweetie Belle,Don't worry. We won't make that same mistake again.
Apple Bloom,"Aw, great. Look who showed up to make fun of us."
Scootaloo,So much for learning skills to be big shots.
Diamond Tiara,"Hey, guess what! I told everyone about your special Twilight Time!"
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, no, here it comes..."
Diamond Tiara,And they all want in!
Diamond Tiara,"Thanks to me, you three are now the hottest thing around. You're welcome."
Sweetie Belle,Uh-oh...
Sweetie Belle,Wow! All these ponies really wanna meet Twilight that badly?
Pipsqueak,"We love you, Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Diamond Tiara,"Now, now, everypony! Demanding time with the princess as an unruly mob simply won't do. Might I suggest you get organized through us, the Cutie Mark Crusaders' nearest and dearest friends?"
Silver Spoon,"Everypony get in line! No pushing, no pushing!"
Apple Bloom,What a mess.
Sweetie Belle,Of awesome! Don't you see? We're really and truly and certifiably the biggest of the big shots in school right now!
Scootaloo,Huh?
Sweetie Belle,"They all think we're the greatest, because we're their ticket to get time with Ponyville's newest and biggest celebrity, Princess Twilight!"
Apple Bloom,We just said like two seconds ago that invitin' two ponies to Twilight Time was a big mistake! And now we're supposed to bring the whole class?
Sweetie Belle,Relax. I got this.
Apple Bloom,"I don't like this, Sweetie Belle..."
Sweetie Belle,You said not to invite them to Twilight Time and I didn't. So what's the problem?
Scootaloo,This feels like a trick.
Sweetie Belle,What's tricky about inviting Twilight out for a meal thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us? Seems like the least we can do for the princess!
Pipsqueak,"Did someone say ""princess""?"
Sweetie Belle,"When I told you when you could come eyeball the princess at one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or three of you, tops!"
Foals,Oops...
Scootaloo,She's coming!
Sweetie Belle,Okay! But stay out of sight!
Diamond Tiara,"As you wish, Sweetie Belle."
Sweetie Belle,"Yes, as I wish."
Twilight Sparkle,"[messy eating noises] Mmm! Mmmm, mm! [with mouth full] I didn't realize how hungry I was! I'm so glad you asked me to join you here today... [swallows] I'm so honored! Mm!"
Sweetie Belle,You are?
Twilight Sparkle,"When you first asked me to help you develop new skills, I thought, 'Working with young students so devoted to the joy of learning purely for its own sake? What could be better?' You all remind me of myself when I was your age!"
Sweetie Belle,"Yes, well... we feel the same way."
Apple Bloom,That's why we invited you here.
Scootaloo,All because of our love of learning!
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight! Haven't seen you here in, like, forever and a half!"
Twilight Sparkle,I know. I've been so busy I forgot how delicious everything is here!
Pinkie Pie,"Totally! Hey, what's going on out there? Oh, never mind, they're gone. They're back! Never mind, they're gone. La la-la la-la..."
Apple Bloom,[through gritted teeth] Knock it off!
Apple Bloom,What was all this? And this?
Scootaloo,"I couldn't help it! When I don't smile in a picture, I look sad."
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, we're gonna look sad all right..."
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] [long pause] Uh, can I... help you?"
Diamond Tiara,Get my picture with her!
Pipsqueak,Me first!
Silver Spoon,Hey! Get out of the shot!
Sweetie Belle,This is bad.
Scootaloo,Twilight's gonna be so ticked at us.
Apple Bloom,I told ya this was a terrible idea.
Twilight Sparkle,"You seriously all want my autograph? Okay, I'll sign just a couple more for you, but then I really must get back to my little friends. Oh, there you are!"
Pipsqueak,"Wow, to think I've been to the Hay Burger so many times, never knowing it's a regular hangout for a princess!"
Twilight Sparkle,This isn't my regular hangout. I'm only here to be with them.
Pipsqueak,"You mean, Princess Twilight decides where it's cool to go based on where they go?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks, guys, this was fun! See ya around!"
Pipsqueak,I'm opening a new lemonade stand! Won't you come to the grand opening? I'll give you free lemonade for a week!
Sweetie Belle,Relax. I know exactly how to handle this.
Pipsqueak,More lemonade?
Sweetie Belle,Don't mind if I do!
Classmate Pony 2,Done shining your hooves! It's an honor to do you the favor!
Scootaloo,"Whoa, so bright I can see myself!"
Apple Bloom,And so can I! Nice job bedazzlin' my bow! What do I owe you?
Classmate Pony 3,Your gratitude is thanks enough.
Diamond Tiara,You three must come to my pool party. It'll be much cooler than this.
Sweetie Belle,Look who's inviting who to her fancy house!
Apple Bloom,"I believe we have arrived, Cutie Mark Crusaders."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Yeah!
Sweetie Belle,"Wow, this is nice, but there's no one else here. Why is this party cooler, exactly?"
Diamond Tiara,Because of all the ponies we're keeping out.
Sweetie Belle,"This has been great, but we have to go. It's Twilight Time."
Diamond Tiara,"So, we're coming too, right?"
Sweetie Belle,"Um... a-actually, no. We didn't have a chance to ask Twilight, so<U+0096>"
Diamond Tiara,Really? After all the favors we did for you? After all the favors they did for you?
Sweetie Belle,"Okay, I know exactly how to handle this. Run!"
Sweetie Belle,"Go, go, go!"
Scootaloo,We gotta beat them to Twilight's so we can explain!
Sweetie Belle,This way! I know a shortcut!
Apple Bloom,"Then we run, like the wind!"
Foals,Twilight Time! Twilight Time!
Sweetie Belle,[gasps] [out of breath] We... made... it... Quick! Knock on<U+0096>
Sweetie Belle,"Twilight, we can explain."
Apple Bloom,We know you said we should just keep Twilight Time to us!
Scootaloo,We didn't mean for so many other ponies to be here! Honest!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, don't be silly. I only meant that for your benefit so you could get the most out of our time together. But if you want to share your time with others, that's fine."
Scootaloo,So you're not mad?
Twilight Sparkle,"Of course not! Come on in, everypony! Spike made nachos!"
Twilight Sparkle,Turns out we'll need some more than that.
Twilight Sparkle,"Before we start, we should maybe get a bit more organized? Ponies interested in magic in this corner. Ponies who want to learn potions over here. Bookworm ponies over there."
Apple Bloom,Incredible. Looks like everything's workin' out just fine.
Scootaloo,And I was so afraid Twilight would be disappointed in us.
Sweetie Belle,Told you I knew exactly how to handle all this!
Twilight Sparkle,Thanks to all of you for taking time out to come learn new things.
Diamond Tiara,"Thank you, princess!"
Silver Spoon,"We love you, princess!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, okay, let's settle down. If you want to thank anypony, thank the Cutie Mark Crusaders for so generously sharing this time."
Sweetie Belle,"It was nothing, really. We just felt it was the right thing to do."
Diamond Tiara,Hmph! What a laugh.
Twilight Sparkle,"Let's begin over here. And what would you like to learn, little one?"
Pipsqueak,I want to learn how to become a Cutie Mark Crusader!
Twilight Sparkle,"And why do you want to become a Cutie Mark Crusader so badly, hm?"
Pipsqueak,Because then I could get all my classmates to do me favors and stuff because I'm friends with a famous princess!
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, boy."
Twilight Sparkle,Is this true?
Sweetie Belle,We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you and learn new things. Really and truly!
Twilight Sparkle,Prove it.
Sweetie Belle,Huh?!
Twilight Sparkle,"If it's true, then I'm sure you've all been practicing your skills over the past week. Show me how much better you got."
Apple Bloom,"Uh, well, uh... we... can't."
Scootaloo,We kinda rushed over and forgot to bring our stuff.
Twilight Sparkle,"Hm, I see."
Sweetie Belle,"No, wait! Hey, everypony, you're in luck! You came to learn, but instead you're getting dinner and a show! Get ready, 'cause we, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, are about to lay on you the amazing skills we learned in Twilight Time!"
Sweetie Belle,"Unfortunately, since we don't have Scootaloo's unicycle parts, she'll take apart and put back together one of the scooters from outside."
Pipsqueak,Hey! That's my scooter!
Scootaloo,"You got us into this mess, kid. Might wanna roll with us."
Pipsqueak,Huh?
Sweetie Belle,"Apple Bloom doesn't have her apple seed with her, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen. And I will begin by using my magic to lift this broom!"
Scootaloo,Ta-da!
Apple Bloom,Become a tree!
Sweetie Belle,Rise!
Sweetie Belle,That didn't turn out quite how I had hoped.
Twilight Sparkle,Looks like Twilight Time is over.
Diamond Tiara,And look who's not the princess's entourage anymore.
Foals,Oooh!
Silver Spoon,Guess they didn't come here to learn after all.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, neither did any of you."
Foals,Awww...
Sweetie Belle,"We're really sorry, Twilight. We made a huge mistake."
Apple Bloom,And we really and truly did enjoy learning new skills with you.
Scootaloo,"Guess we'll have to just keep on doing it without you now. Thanks, Twilight."
Apple Bloom,Thanks...
Sweetie Belle,Thanks...
Twilight Sparkle,Sweetie Belle? Remember a moment ago when you asked me to give you a chance?
Spike,"[straining] Aw, come on!"
Sweetie Belle,"I guess Twilight must not be so super-upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do. Boy, did we get our priorities messed up. We started acting special because we were friends with someone special. We almost forgot the real reason she's special <U+0096> because she's our friend. But she forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new! That's the kind of magic I really want to get good at, now that I'm getting so good at the other kind."
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, all three of you have made so much progress! I'm really proud of you. See you next time!"
Sweetie Belle,We're just glad Twilight Time is back to normal. Well... almost back to normal. I just hope no one sees us.
Apple Bloom,'Cause we're tryin' to keep Twilight Time a secret now?
Scootaloo,Or because we look ridiculous?
Sweetie Belle,"A little of both, actually."
Fluttershy,"Okay, everypony. As you know, the adorable fairy creatures known as Breezies are about to come through Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie,"Yes! Ooh, it's so exciting! Ah! I can't wait for Rainbow Dash to make the breeze for them so I can see how cute they are up close!"
Rainbow Dash,"I've never done it before, not that I won't be totally awesome at it, because I totally will!"
Fluttershy,"And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny-tiny little things, so they have the confidence to ride that breeze to their native land. Did I mention how tiny they are? So tiny! I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer!"
Pinkie Pie,I love cheers!
Fluttershy,"But these cheers should be quiet cheers. We don't want to startle them. They need to be able to concentrate. Why don't we try it? You can do it, Breezies."
Rest of main cast,"[shouting] You can do it, Breezies!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, my."
Applejack,"Heh, sorry, Fluttershy. I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly."
Fluttershy,"Oh, it's okay. Quiet doesn't come naturally for everypony. Let's try it again."
Rest of main cast,"[quieter but still loudly] You can do it, Breezies!"
Fluttershy,Perhaps just a little bit quieter.
Rest of main cast,"[quieter] You can do it, Breezies!"
Fluttershy,Just a little quieter.
Rest of main cast,"[practically whispering] You can do it, Breezies!"
Fluttershy,"[loudly] Perfect! Oh, um, I mean... yay."
Rainbow Dash,That's too strong! We gotta slow this breeze down or we're gonna blow those Breezies apart!
Mr. Cake,Mr. What I don't understand is why they need the Pegasi to make a breeze for them.
Fluttershy,"Well, you see, it's the breeze that activates the Breezies' magic, and that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed."
Mr. Cake,"Mr. So, no breeze means no magic means the pollen goes bad?"
Fluttershy,That's right! And they only have two days to get that pollen back before the portal to their home closes. That's why it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through Ponyville safely.
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. We certainly wouldn't want to scare them and divert them from their path!
Fluttershy,Now you understand.
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Hm, you certainly know a lot about them."
Fluttershy,"Oh, thank you. I went to see them gathering their pollen in Western Equestria. Um, Rarity? I, uh, hate to weigh in with you when it comes to fashion, but..."
Rarity,"Oh, there's too much purple on this, isn't there? I knew it! But Twilight refused to admit it."
Twilight Sparkle,What?! I-
Fluttershy,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no. It's the perfect amount of purple. It's just that there's an awful lot of sequins on your jacket."
Fluttershy,"You can if they reflect the sun, and the light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes, and blinds them long enough to get them off their course so they never get home!"
Rarity,I stand corrected! I suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins. I'll just take off my jacket. I suppose this won't do either?
Twilight Sparkle,"[whispering] Everypony, it's time. Please welcome... the Breezies!"
Applejack,They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born.
Rarity,And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in?
Seabreeze,Lun! Arshen aifok!
Pinkie Pie,So... cute! Can't... take... it!
Spike,"[grunts] [hushed] Pinkie Pie, can I hop on you so I can see the Breezies?"
Pinkie Pie,"[hushed, straining] May explode!"
Spike,"Oh, no!"
Rainbow Dash,Slow down the breeze for the other group to catch up!
Cloud Chaser,They're too far back! We can't connect the breeze to both sets of Breezies!
Rainbow Dash,What if we speed it up?
Flitter,"Then the first group'll be going too fast, and they'll get separated from each other!"
Seabreeze,Tanagretu nik mir! Maisegu de piripa!
Seabreeze,Mekenar stuf!
Fluttershy,He's right! You must all gather as close as you possibly can!
Seabreeze,Mugudi saikendus?
Fluttershy,"Oh, I understand the language of all kinds of creatures!"
Seabreeze,You must be so proud.
Fluttershy,And you speak my language too?
Seabreeze,"I can. This lot can only understand you. Clearly, they're not the brightest bunch around."
Pinkie Pie,That was amazing!
Rainbow Dash,I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others.
Fluttershy,"Oh, it's not your fault."
Twilight Sparkle,"I, for one, am very proud of you, Fluttershy. Leaping into action like that."
Rarity,I feel like I should design you a special hero's gown! Heh... Or a sash. At least a sash.
Spike,"Okay, okay, okay! I know what you're all thinking! Why don't you just say it?! [crying] I'm sorry! This is all my fault! I'm so, so sorry!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, Spike, it's okay! It could have happened to any one of us."
Spike,Okay... Thank you!
Spike,Uh... I'm... just... gonna stay over here.
Rainbow Dash,"So, Fluttershy, you want us to get the breeze going again so these little guys can get a move on?"
Fluttershy,Maybe we should wait just a moment or so. They've been through so much...
Rainbow Dash,Just gimme the word when you think they're ready.
Fluttershy,"Oh, my, Twirly, you look like you need a blanket."
Twirly,Sanken
Fluttershy,"Oh, no problem."
Breezie,Malenki?
Fluttershy,"Oh, did you need some more water?"
Fluttershy,"Now, who else needed a hoof-knitted sweater?"
Applejack,Hey there! Can we come in?
Fluttershy,"Oh, of course! But watch your step!"
Applejack,"Oop, sorry about that, little one."
Twilight Sparkle,We just wanted to see if you thought the Breezies were ready to give it another try.
Fluttershy,"Has it been an hour already? Oh, my goodness! Time flies when you're making sure little creatures don't feel that you're abandoning them to the cruel world."
Twilight Sparkle,"But they're not going to a cruel world, right? They're going home."
Fluttershy,"Oh, yes, that's right!"
Fluttershy,"On second thought, I don't think they're quite ready."
Seabreeze,Supa laipas data kurpa! Mise neku ersken laika maur! Siripat sulat!
Applejack,Uh... what did he say?
Fluttershy,I'd... rather not say.
Applejack,"Okay, well, I'm sure you know what you're doin'. No one knows rare magical creatures like you do."
Twilight Sparkle,We'll just wait for your word.
Fluttershy,Thank you. I'll be in touch very soon.
Seabreeze,"We need to go now, or we will never get home! I wish we did not need that stupid breeze to activate our magic, or I would just force you all to fly home right now! Why do we have to need magic to keep our pollen safe?"
Fluttershy,"Um, now, Seabreeze-"
Seabreeze,"Why are you giving in to these wimps?! If they had not been so scared in the first place, this never would have happened!"
Fluttershy,"But that is just not true, Seabreeze. It was because of a leaf, and you know that!"
Seabreeze,"Oh, please! They have no idea what they're doing out there! Like you said, we need as much time as we can get because they are so incompetent!"
Fluttershy,"Well, I didn't say that exactly now, did I?"
Seabreeze,Hmph!
Fluttershy,"Oh, well, maybe a snack will lighten the mood."
Breezie,[burp] Mi fargen.
Fluttershy,"You're excused. Well, my Breezies, I think we can all agree that now that you've eaten and you have a little energy going in your breezy bodies, you're strong enough to face the breeze! I've loved having you here, and I hope I've made you all feel loved and special. But you have to go. Nopony here will deny that-"
Fluttershy,"Okay, well, a confusing pep-talk, but nonetheless. I do know that if you don't leave soon, you may never make it back, and that would be terrible!"
Breezie,[sneezes] Merte marshken farde.
Twirly,[coughs] Merki marshken plumatu.
Fluttershy,I had no idea you all have colds! Really? All of you?
Fluttershy,"Oh, dear. I can't let you go out there sick! What kind of a friend would I be if I made you go now?"
Seabreeze,D'oh! Irde turten manes pudenhel! Nievo ut! Parde tarmen!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Fluttershy, just wondering if the Breezies are ready to go yet. Clock's kinda ticking for them to make it back before the door closes on their home."
Fluttershy,"Oh, yes. I mean, not quite. Um, maybe just a few more minutes?"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, alright."
Flitter,"We wait too much longer, we'll have to create such a strong breeze, it may be more than they can handle."
Rainbow Dash,We just have to trust Fluttershy. She must know what she's doing.
Breezies,Aww!
Seabreeze,Why are you spending your time on this?! I will never get home!
Fluttershy,"Breezies, I must say, Seabreeze has a point. I think it's time for me to get Rainbow Dash and her friends so they can create the breeze for you to get home."
Fluttershy,"Ooh... You're all awfully anxious... Oh, I don't want you to feel abandoned, or that I wasn't the most kind host I could possibly be..."
Twirly,Adoshen papan gorn.
Fluttershy,"Oh, yes, that does make sense... Seabreeze, do you think you could wait just a couple more hou- Seabreeze? Seabreeze? Has anypony seen Seabreeze? [gasps] Where's he going? There's no way he can handle being out there on his own!"
Seabreeze,Ah! Ah! Ah! Blusken! Ah! Ah! Arge nusen! Uf! Osemi! Ah! Narsken! Noi serenda! Ah!
Seabreeze,Ah! Gah! Ah! Kesino! Uu! Tu ge! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Miuse konda!
Seabreeze,Vaior uskren! Yavaya...
Seabreeze,"Ibeku-u-u! Ah, sa-sabada!"
Fluttershy,"Excuse me, bees? Can you please back off my Breezie friend? He didn't mean any harm. It was just an accident. I'm working on a bee-type dance and was hoping you could help me? Does this bring to mind any images for you? Perhaps a bee? Excuse me! I have done nothing but be kind, but I guess that is not working! You bees know better than to hurt a helpless Breezie! I demand that you go away now, or you'll have to answer to me!"
Seabreeze,Menkyulen. Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you for coming after me!
Fluttershy,Of course. You could've gotten seriously hurt out there. Ponyville is much too dangerous for you. One tiny acorn is a threat!
Seabreeze,"Yeah, I know! That is one reason why I have been trying to get us to go from the beginning!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness. I was just trying not to hurt any creature's feelings, but my displays of kindness may have cost you everything... [gasps] Time is running out, and you may never make it home!"
Seabreeze,That is exactly what I have been telling all of them! But they do not listen to me! Nobreezie ever listens to me!
Fluttershy,"Seabreeze, I understand your feelings are hurt, but it's hard for them to hear you when you're shouting and being mean. The message doesn't get across."
Seabreeze,"But what about those bees? You were not nice to them, and that was the only way they listened!"
Fluttershy,"Yes, but they had to go, and they wouldn't listen to me any other way. We need to go, now!"
Fluttershy,"My dear Breezies, I had to rescue Seabreeze from serious harm, and now I know more than ever that you must leave before it's too late! You would never survive in Ponyville."
Breezies,Erski parli polin!
Rainbow Dash,It's too strong!
Flitter,I can't do it any lighter!
Cloud Chaser,Neither can I!
Rainbow Dash,"Fly back! I'm gonna try and see if I can slow it down. Now it's too light! Oh, this will never get them home!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, my. Maybe it's because there are too few of them. When they started their journey, there was more of them to face the breeze together."
Twilight Sparkle,"I've been studying an old spell book from the Castle of the Two Sisters. There's a spell that I think could help us! This is probably gonna feel a little funny at first, but you're gonna have to trust me."
Pinkie Pie,I love new ideas that make me feel funny at first!
Fluttershy,"Maifo flai batendud! [high-pitched] Um, I mean, let's go!"
Breezette,Marskin farskin.
Breezie,Metar.
Seabreeze,"You can do this! I am sorry for how I treated you before! It was not right that I called you names! I did not even really believe those things I said! I was worried we would never get back to our home, and I lashed out... I know you can do this! I believe in you! Hold on to me, let us join the group!"
Rainbow Dash,[high-pitched] Holy mini-sized paradise!
Rarity,[high-pitched] This is simply beautiful! So much inspiration. Where's my sketchpad when I need it?
Pinkie Pie,[high-pitched] So...stinkin'...cute!
Applejack,"[high-pitched] You okay, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy,[high-pitched] I'm just so very happy they got to be reunited with their family!
Rarity,"[high-pitched] We'd better get going before the entrance- well, exit for us, closes."
Fluttershy,"[high-pitched] Goodbye, Breezies. I must go now."
Seabreeze,To remember us by.
Fluttershy,"[high-pitched] Thank you! I'll miss you. I'll miss all of you! [voiceover, normal] My experiences with the Breezies have helped me to see that kindness can take many forms, and sometimes being too kind can actually keep a friend from doing what they need to do. Pushing them away may seem cruel, but it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do."
Rainbow Dash,[high-pitched] Whoa! That was a close one!
Twilight Sparkle,"[high-pitched] Okay, gather round."
Rainbow Dash,"So, uh, I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to be a griffon."
Twilight Sparkle,Not a chance.
Rainbow Dash,You sure? What about a dragon? No? It doesn't have to shoot fire!
Scootaloo,"Whatever they decide, Apple Bloom, we'll be here for you."
Sweetie Belle,"Totally. Even though it could change everything for you, forever and ever!"
Granny Smith,"So, we here have decided... that you're old enough to stay home alone and take care of the chores yourself for the afternoon!"
Apple Bloom,I accept your decision.
Apple Bloom,"Stayin' home alone, by myself, on my own! I can't believe I'm really doin' it!"
Applejack,"Now, hey there, filly. I know you're excited, but bein' the only pony here to take care of the day's chores is a big responsibility."
Apple Bloom,I know it! And it means everythin' to me that y'all think I'm grown up enough to handle it. I won't let you down.
Granny Smith,"Well, if'n I'm gonna make my train, I best to be off. When Great Aunt Pine Apple says a pony's gots to ride by a certain time, you better be there! You be sure and take care now, Apple Bloom. Y'all take care as well. I don't know which of your delivery routes is tougher. you're each headed to a mighty hard-to-reach town."
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,"We know, Granny. That's the only reason I agreed to let Apple Bloom stay behind alone."
Apple Bloom,It is?
Applejack,"Oh, I didn't mean it like that, sugarcube. It's just, I take my job as your big sister real serious, which is why I spent all night makin' this."
Apple Bloom,What is it?
Applejack,Just a little list of helpful reminders.
Apple Bloom,"[reading] ""There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator. Be sure not to heat it up too much. If it's hot, blow on it to cool it off. And take little sips <U+0097> if you gulp, you could get hiccups."" You don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself and the chores! I'm ready for this."
Applejack,[sighs] I guess you are. I'm just not so sure I am.
Apple Bloom,"But you trust me and believe I'm grown up enough to handle this, right?"
Applejack,"[sighs] Right. Okay then. Good luck, little sis<U+0097> whoa!"
Apple Bloom,[quickly] Okaygreatseeyousoonbye!
Big McIntosh,Eyuu-up!
Apple Bloom,Woo-hoo! I'm alone! At home! I'm home alone! This is gonna be so awesome!
Applejack,"Eheheh... Sorry, Big Mac. I was just frettin' a bit about Apple Bloom. You think she's gonna be okay on her own?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,"I just keep on thinkin' of things I forgot to put on her list. Like, I didn't write down that if she wants to get a spoon out of the drawer, she needs to open the drawer first. [sighs] I know, I'm probably just bein' silly."
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,"But I know I'd feel a heap better if I could just check on Apple Bloom one last time. You go on ahead and make your delivery. I'm just gonna take a quick peek, and then I'll make mine."
Apple Bloom,"Okay, number one seventy two: ""Make sure to pump the bellows to keep the stove warm."""
Apple Bloom,"Check! ""Make sure the hats and bows closet is fully stocked."" Check! [spits] That's everything on Applejack's list! And now that my chores are done, since there's no one else here, I get to make all the decisions! If I wanna listen to music, I can! If I wanna read a book, I can! If I wanna just stand here in the kitchen talkin' to myself, I can!"
Applejack,Apple Bloom!
Apple Bloom,Whoa!
Apple Bloom,Ugh... Applejack?
Applejack,"I came back to check on you, and I'm so glad I did! I never thought about how dangerous things are around here!"
Apple Bloom,"Thanks, but I'm really gonna be okay."
Applejack,You are now! Because I'm here and I'm stayin'! No way am I leavin' my little baby sister home alone all by herself!
Apple Bloom,I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself! And what about those pies you're supposed to deliver?
Applejack,Pies? Ha! Family's way more important than pies!
Apple Bloom,But I'm fine! And actually... this was kind of your fault.
Applejack,I know. I should never have left you alone.
Apple Bloom,"But I don't need you lookin' after me. I'm perfectly capable of stayin' home alone. Really! Just look! ""There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator."""
Applejack,What was that?
Apple Bloom,Watch me!
Apple Bloom,Whoa! Ugh!
Applejack,"Oh, no! This is worse than I thought! Well, don't worry, Apple Bloom, I'm here now and I'm not leavin' you home alone ever again. I'm stickin' right by your side, always!"
Applejack,Apple Bloom? Apple Bloom!
Apple Bloom,Applejack's just overreactin' a bit. I'm sure she'll snap out of it. Whoa!
Applejack,You need somethin'? I'm right here!
Apple Bloom,"I know you mean well, but I don't need you watchin' over me! I can take care of things myself!"
Apple Bloom,Look! Huh? Hey! Who put pillows on this rake?
Applejack,"[chuckles] Oh, I don't know. Maybe someone who really loves her little sister and doesn't want her to get an owie?"
Apple Bloom,Hm? Hm.
Apple Bloom,"Oh, for the love of...! [sighs] You've gone and baby-proofed everythin'!"
Applejack,"Heh, yup! Your big sister let you down once, but I promise it won't ever happen again."
Apple Bloom,"But really, I'm fine! I can take care of myself. I don't need you watchin' over me!"
Applejack,"Aw, that's sweet. I appreciate you tryin' to make me feel better, but don't worry. I'll always be here for you. Always!"
Apple Bloom,[sighs] And that's the reason I asked y'all to come over quick.
Applejack,"Hey, Apple Bloom! You need anything? A snack? A hoof massage? Maybe a snack while havin' a hoof massage?"
Sweetie Belle,"Why, that sounds delightful!"
Apple Bloom,[through gritted teeth] No thank you!
Applejack,"O-kay, well you can count on me bein' close by if'n you need anythin'!"
Apple Bloom,"[sighs] You see what I mean? If this keeps up, I'm never gonna be able to do anythin' without Applejack hoverin' over me!"
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,Mm-hm.
Scootaloo,So what can we do? Hmm.
Sweetie Belle,Uh...
Scootaloo,Um...
Apple Bloom,Hang on a sec! I got it!
Sweetie Belle,What?
Apple Bloom,"The pies! I'll sneak out and deliver them! Granny said that they were goin' to some incredibly hard-to-reach town. If I can do it alone, that'll show Applejack I don't need somepony watchin' over me!"
Scootaloo,Just one problem. Your sister's gonna come back and check on you any minute!
Sweetie Belle,Which means you need an escape plan.
Scootaloo,"Ooh, and I got an idea for one! [mocks snoring] See? It'll look just like you're sleeping in bed. Sweetie and I can take turns! That way, when one of us gets tired, the other can take over. Brilliant, huh?"
Sweetie Belle,Mm-hm!
Apple Bloom,You know what? It is! I got a feelin' this just might work! We're gonna make my sister see I don't need her watchin' over me<U+0097>
Scootaloo,Stop! No time for a song! Applejack's coming!
Sweetie Belle,"If you're gonna go, we've gotta get you out of here now!"
Apple Bloom,"Cutie Mark Crusaders, let's do it!"
Apple Bloom,Whoa!
Applejack,"[muffled] Everythin' okay in there, sugarcube?"
Scootaloo,"Quick, get in while I hide! Sweetie, no! You gotta sleep like Apple Bloom!"
Sweetie Belle,How does she sleep?
Scootaloo,Like she does everything! With sass!
Applejack,"Huh. I guess you must've been so tuckered out, you sent your friends home and went to bed. Then again, you are a delicate flower. [sighs] Sleep tight, Apple Bloom. I'll check on you again in a bit."
Applejack,Just checkin' in on you again!
Applejack,Need anythin' now?
Applejack,How 'bout now?
Applejack,Need another blanket?
Applejack,Did I hear a cough?
Applejack,Want a glass of water?
Applejack,"[yawning] Just... checkin' in on you again. [sighs] Look at you, dozin' so peaceful-like. Here I am, checkin' up on you every five seconds, and you're totally fine. Maybe you don't need me frettin' over you all the time."
Scootaloo,"[gasps] [muffled] Wow, Apple Bloom will be so glad to hear that!"
Applejack,Huh? Scootaloo?
Scootaloo,"Uh, um, n-no."
Applejack,"Sweetie Belle? But... where's Apple Bloom? She's not here! She could be anywhere! She could be lost, cold, hungry, itchy, stuffed up, needin' to go to the bathroom!"
Sweetie Belle,"Don't worry, we know exactly where she is."
Scootaloo,"Yeah, she's making your pie delivery."
Applejack,What?! No! Didn't she hear how difficult and dangerous it was?! [gasp] I may never see my little sister again!
Applejack,"Okay, Rarity's on her way here to look after you two. Now tell me, did Apple Bloom at least bring flameproof boots? A lion tamer's chair? A snake charmin' flute?! A hunk of ricotta?! [gasps] [teeth chattering] Okay, maybe there's still time to catch her before she gets there. When did she leave?"
Sweetie Belle,It must've been hours ago.
Applejack,"Oh, no!"
Apple Bloom,"Well, now at least I can see."
Chimera's tiger head,Chimera' I'd stay where you are. This is the only safe spot around here.
Apple Bloom,[nervous whimpering] It don't look so safe to me.
Chimera's tiger head,"Chimera' Oh, we just mean from the flames."
Chimera's goat head,"Chimera' Yeah, not from us."
Chimera's snake head,"Chimera' What was that? Ah, can you guysss ssspeak up?"
Chimera's tiger head,Chimera' I was about to tell our guest how we haven't eaten in days.
Chimera's goat head,Chimera' My sisters and I can never agree on what to eat.
Chimera's snake head,Chimera' [hisses] Excccept... pie.
Apple Bloom,"Well, unfortunately, I gotta get these pies to a town on the other side of the swamp, so, uh..."
Chimera's tiger head,"Chimera' Oh, you don't have to worry about that."
Chimera's goat head,"Chimera' Yeah, you don't have to worry about anything anymore."
Chimera's snake head,Chimera' Because we're going to have our apple pie with a ssside of filly filet.
Chimera's tiger head,"Chimera' Now, sisters, on three! One!"
Chimera's goat head,Chimera' Two!
Chimera's snake head,Chimera' [hisses] Three!
Apple Bloom,No!
Chimera's tiger head,Chimera' Where are the pies?!
Chimera's snake head,Chimera' They're not back here.
Chimera's goat head,Chimera' This is your fault! You think you've always got to be in charge!
Chimera's tiger head,"Chimera' [sighs] You're lucky, you know? You've got no idea what it's like to have a sister constantly looking over your shoulder!"
Apple Bloom,"Uh, actually..."
Chimera's goat head,"Chimera' Let's try listening to me for a change! And I say, if there are no pies, let's settle for the filly filet!"
Chimera's snake head,Chimera' [hisses] Any lassst wordsss?
Apple Bloom,I really wish my sister were here!
Applejack,"Hang on, Apple Bloom! I'm a-comin'!"
Chimera's tiger head and goat head,Chimera' Get her!
Chimera's goat head,Chimera' Hey! I thought I was in charge now!
Applejack,Howdy!
Chimera's goat head,"Chimera' [growls] [bleats] Mm, ricotta!"
Applejack,Let's go!
Applejack,[panting] Are you okay?
Apple Bloom,Thanks to you.
Applejack,"I told you you need your big sister lookin' after you! I'm just glad this wasn't a whole lot worse. I mean, sure we lost the cart and all the pies, but at least you're<U+0097> Huh, the cart! And all the pies! You actually got them all the way up here? In the dark? Through the Flame Geyser Swamp? Past that monster? ...By yourself?"
Apple Bloom,Well... yeah.
Applejack,"Huh, wow. That's mighty impressive! Anypony who can do that on her own, well, she don't need somepony like me babyin' her."
Others,"""Duce Switchell"": Mm-hm! Andouille! This pie's even tastier than my momma's swamp water casserole!"
Others,"""Duce Switchell"": Aw, now, momma, don't be like that."
Applejack,"Just remember, you fellas wouldn't be enjoyin' these pies if it weren't for my sister."
Apple Bloom,And my sister!
Applejack,But this don't change the fact that tryin' to make this delivery on your own was a plumb crazy thing to do!
Apple Bloom,I know...
Applejack,"[scoffs] I bet Granny Smith grounds you for a month for sneakin' out! And if Big Mac, Granny Smith 'n I ever have to be away for the day again... I would totally trust you to stay home and take care of things on your own. I guess I did get a little carried away watchin' over you, and if you hadn't snuck out like you did, maybe I wouldn't have figured that out."
Apple Bloom,Yes! Now that is the kind of 'looking after me' that I can definitely appreciate! So... we're good?
Applejack,"Little sister, we're always good."
Applejack,Has anypony heard from Pinkie Pie since yesterday?
Rest of main cast,Nuh-uh.
Rainbow Dash,[yawns] I don't see what's so important we had to meet her here this early. Celestia hasn't even raised the sun yet!
Pinkie Pie,Thank goodness you're all here! There's no time to lose!
Rarity,Whoa!
Fluttershy,Ooh...
Rainbow Dash,Ugh! Hey- whoa!
Pinkie Pie,Careful!
Twilight Sparkle,What is all this?
Pinkie Pie,"My sister Maud's gonna be here soon, and I need your help taste-testing my rock candy recipes!"
Applejack,"Uh, we're happy to help you, Pinkie Pie, but this seems like an awful lot of candy."
Rarity,Even for you.
Pinkie Pie,Everypony ready for more?
Rainbow Dash,Ugh. My teeth hurt.
Applejack,I think we've had plenty. And shouldn't you be on your way to pick up Maud from the train station?
Twilight Sparkle,Maud is your sister. I'm sure she'll love your rock candy. And I'm pretty sure you've made enough. She's only staying for the week.
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, it's not just for Maud, silly. I'm making candy for all of us!"
Applejack,"Aw, what a great tradition."
Rainbow Dash,Hold on. The secret ingredient is rocks?
Pinkie Pie,Yeah. But these are a special kind of rock that Maud discovered.
Fluttershy,"Oh, what kind of a rock are they?"
Pinkie Pie,"Can't tell ya that, silly! [whispering] It's a secret! [speaking normally] Now that Maud is heading out to get her rocktorate in rock science, this may be our last chance to trade them for a really long time. I can't wait for you all to meet her. I just know that my best Ponyville friends and my best sister friend are gonna become bestest friends! We can make bestest-est friend rock candy necklaces together! She expresses herself through fashion just like Rarity, and she's really smart and loves reading just like Twilight! And she's honest, and loves forest things, and is good at games, and... Well, oh, she's awesome!"
Rarity,"[strained] She sounds amazing, but won't she start worrying if you aren't at the train station when she gets here?"
Pinkie Pie,She sure will. [gasp] I gotta get out of here!
Fluttershy,I sure hope Maud has an appetite.
Applejack,Never met a pony or critter who didn't love Granny Smith's apple spiced muffins!
Rarity,"Oh, it's no use! I simply cannot find anything suitable to wear!"
Rainbow Dash,"I doubt she'll notice what anypony's wearing, so what's the big deal?"
Rarity,The big deal is that it will be very difficult to show Maud what a strong fashion presence we have in Ponyville if the most fashion-forward pony here can't keep her hat from falling apart!
Twilight Sparkle,"I think we're all a little nervous about Maud's visit. She's Pinkie Pie's sister, and it's obvious Pinkie really wants us to hit it off. Being able to make those rock candy necklaces together is really important to her. I'm sure everything will be fine<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,We're heeeere!
Twilight Sparkle,Where's Maud?
Pinkie Pie,She's coming!
Rainbow Dash,Uh... you sure?
Pinkie Pie,She's not quite as fast as me. I asked Gummy to stay with her in case she got lost!
Rainbow Dash,[whispering] Is she even moving?
Pinkie Pie,"We're over here, Maud!"
Maud Pie,[sniffs] [deadpan] Hm. Sedimentary.
Rainbow Dash,Huh?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] This is a sedimentary rock.
Twilight Sparkle,"That's... really fascinating, isn't it, girls? We're just so thrilled you could come for a visit before your big trip. Pinkie Pie has told us so much about you. I'm Twilight, and this is Applejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity."
Fluttershy,We're ever so glad to meet you.
Applejack,We're just gonna have the best time!
Rarity,Pinkie Pie tells me you share my love for fashion.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'm really into expressing myself through my wardrobe.
Rarity,A-and what is the delightful frock you're wearing now saying?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] It doesn't talk. It's a dress.
Applejack,"Uh, so this here's Winona. That's Owlowiscious, Tank, Opal, and Angel. Pinkie Pie told us you have a pet, too."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] He's in my pocket.
Fluttershy,"Oh, you have a pocket pet? Like a tiny mouse? Or a baby bird? Or a trained butterfly?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] It's a rock. His name is Boulder.
Pinkie Pie,"This is going to be the best, most awesome, funnest week ever! I can't wait for us all to become bestest friends!"
Applejack,Maud? Would you like to try one of Granny Smith's famous apple spiced muffins?
Applejack,"Oh, uh, heh, that's not<U+0096> Um..."
Maud Pie,[chews] [with mouth full] [deadpan] It's crunchy.
Pinkie Pie,[chews] [with mouth full] Maud's right! They are crunchy! Yum!
Rainbow Dash,"So, uh, Pinkie Pie tells us you like games."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Boulder and I sometimes play a game called 'Camouflage'. It's kind of like hide and seek but way more intense.
Rainbow Dash,Awesome?
Twilight Sparkle,Any luck?
Fluttershy,"I truly wish I'd spent more time with Boulder, because I'm having a very hard time remembering what he looks like."
Applejack,It's like looking for a pebble in a haystack.
Rarity,More like in a pile of pebbles.
Applejack,"Well, you don't have to make it even harder."
Rarity,Ugh! I give up! this is impossible!
Twilight Sparkle,"It'll hurt Maud's feelings if we all stop playing. Besides, look how much fun Pinkie Pie's having."
Pinkie Pie,Is this him? Is this him? Is this him? Is this him?
Twilight Sparkle,"Just a little longer, okay?"
Applejack,"Uh, alright, fine..."
Rainbow Dash,[simultaneously] Really?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Found him.
Pinkie Pie,Oh! Where was he?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] He was hiding in my pocket.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, come on!"
Fluttershy,"I don't mean to interrupt, but we really should get these little critters home. It's getting awfully late, and they've had a very busy day."
Pinkie Pie,"Maud and I had better get going too. I want her to taste the rock candy we're gonna use for our best friends necklaces! Aw, yeah!"
Applejack,She sure is... different from what I expected.
Rainbow Dash,"We spent all day digging in the dirt, and he was in her pocket the whole time?!"
Fluttershy,"On the bright side, Boulder seemed really sweet."
Rainbow Dash,He's a rock!
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, girls. I'm sure Maud was just nervous about meeting all of us."
Applejack,Maybe she was just acting a little 'off' because she was shy or somethin'.
Twilight Sparkle,"Exactly. It must be awfully intimidating to meet all of us at once, especially since we're already such good friends."
Twilight Sparkle,"Maybe if we spend some time with her one-on-one to try to get to know her better, I'm sure we'll be making those best friend rock candy necklaces in no time."
Rarity,Where shall we start? I've chosen a few fabrics that I think will be stunning with y<U+0096>
Pinkie Pie,"Choices, choices, choices!"
Rarity,"...Of course, if you don't see anything that speaks to you, I would be happy to suggest<U+0096>"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I like this one.
Rarity,[laughs] Pinkie Pie didn't tell us you were so funny!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] What do you mean?
Rarity,"Oh, well, it's just... I believe that is a dishtowel. [beat] B-b-but it does go very well with your complexion. I'm sure I could work my magic and turn it into something fabulous."
Pinkie Pie,Rarity and my sister working together to design something amazing! This is the best day ever!
Rarity,Perhaps I could sew all of these together and make you something you'd like.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] No thanks. One is enough.
Pinkie Pie,Doesn't Maud make the coolest scarves?
Rarity,Quite...
Fluttershy,"Hello there, Hummingway. I'm ever so happy to see you."
Pinkie Pie,What's he saying?
Fluttershy,"He says hello, and he's happy to see us too."
Pinkie Pie,"I wish I could speak hummingbird. Humm! Hum-m-m-m-m, hum!"
Fluttershy,"[to Maud] These spiders only live in Ponyville, and even though they may look a teeny bit scary, they're actually very sweet and help keep other, more dangerous insects away!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I was looking at the rock.
Fluttershy,Oh.
Pinkie Pie,"Thanks again, Fluttershy! Start thinking about which flavors you want to put on your best friend rock candy necklace!"
Fluttershy,Oh gosh. I'm not sure we're even friends yet.
Pinkie Pie,Maud is a total bookworm. She loves poetry!
Twilight Sparkle,I've got lots of poetry. Do you read anything by Quilland Ink? Or Flourish Prose?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I prefer to read my own poetry.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I'd love to hear some of it!"
Maud Pie,[clears throat] [deadpan] Rock. You are a rock. Gray. You are gray. Like a rock. Which you are. Rock.
Others,I've written thousands.
Pinkie Pie,She's so prolific!
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] This next one is about rocks. They're all about rocks. Rocks; these are my rocks. Sediments: make me sedimental. Smooth and round, asleep in the ground. Shades of brown and gray..."
Applejack,"You 'bout done peelin' them apples for the cider, Maud?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I think this one is done.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Should I peel another?
Applejack,"No! I mean, nah. I'm sure there's plenty apples in it already."
Pinkie Pie,[sniffs] Can we taste it now?
Applejack,"Sure, why not?"
Pinkie Pie,[glugs] Wow! That's the best apple cider I've ever had!
Applejack,"What do you think, Maud?"
Maud Pie,[sips] [deadpan] It tastes like apples.
Pinkie Pie,"Told you she was super honest, just like you!"
Applejack,"[nervously] We're practically twins, heh."
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! Let's see you beat that! Whooaa!
Pinkie Pie,That was amazing!
Rainbow Dash,Whoa. How'd you do that?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I threw it.
Rainbow Dash,"I guess you won this one, Maud."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'm not really into... 'winning'.
Pinkie Pie,"Great, you're all here! Maud is out looking for rocks, so this is the perfect time for us to set up everything we'll need to make our best friend rock candy necklaces!"
Pinkie Pie,What's wrong?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'm not sure it's the best time to make best friend rock candy necklaces."
Pinkie Pie,Why not?
Twilight Sparkle,Uh...
Rarity,"Well, darling, you see..."
Fluttershy,"You're ever so thoughtful to share your special bonding ritual with us, but, uh..."
Pinkie Pie,But what?
Applejack,"[sighs] The truth is, we've all been tryin' real hard to get closer to Maud, but, well... maybe some ponies just don't click the way others do."
Applejack,"We just wouldn't feel right makin' somethin' that means we're best friends if, well, we aren't."
Pinkie Pie,"[mane deflates] Oh. Okay. If anypony needs me, I'll be in here trying to figure out what to do with two hundred pounds of rock candy."
Rarity,I feel awful! Just awful...
Fluttershy,Maybe we should have just pretended we were friends with Maud.
Twilight Sparkle,"If we didn't tell Pinkie Pie that we hadn't all become the best of friends, I think Maud would have."
Rainbow Dash,"Maybe, but who really knows? That pony is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an igneous."
Rarity,"Don't you mean ""inside an enigma""?"
Rainbow Dash,Nope. I mean igneous. It's a kind of rock. Ask me how I know that.
Pinkie Pie,I've come up with just the thing to bring everypony closer together!
Rainbow Dash,Huh?
Pinkie Pie,It combines everypony's interests into one giant activity that we can all enjoy together and that will totally bring all of my bestest friends together as bestestest friends! You'll need these.
Rainbow Dash,Like I said: Huh?
Pinkie Pie,"Probably better for me to show you. Watch this! Applesauce tunnel for Applejack, pretty shiny stuff for Rarity, reading material for Twilight, critter time for Fluttershy..."
Pinkie Pie,Cupcakes for yours truly... [chomps] and it's a race for Rainbow Dash!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, what is that?!"
Pinkie Pie,"A rock slide, of course! For Maud! First you climb, then you slide!"
Applejack,I've got a bad feeling about this...
Fluttershy,"Oh, goodness!"
Applejack,Watch out!
Rainbow Dash,What<U+0096> how<U+0096> what?!
Maud Pie,"Pinkie Pie, what were you thinking?"
Pinkie Pie,I guess I wasn't.
Maud Pie,"I know how important it is to you that your friends become my friends, but I just don't think it's going to happen. I think it would be best if I just go back to the rock farm and spend the rest of the week there. It was nice to meet you all. Makes me happy knowing Pinkie Pie has such good friends."
Pinkie Pie,"But... we never even got to make our rock candy necklaces... Wait, Maud! I'll come with you!"
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe Maud cut her trip short.
Rarity,I can't believe we nearly lost Pinkie Pie to that ridiculous obstacle course.
Fluttershy,Thank goodness Maud was able to reach her in time.
Rainbow Dash,Did you see how fast Maud moved?
Rarity,And the way she smashed that huge rock into dust? How in Equestria did she do that?
Fluttershy,Pinkie Pie was in trouble! Maud would move mountains for her if she had to.
Twilight Sparkle,That's it! I think I finally realized what we all have in common with Maud! Something that just might be worthy of a very important super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share!
Maud Pie,Thank you for coming with me. I don't know how long I'll be gone on my rock research trip. I'm glad I still get to spend some time with you before I go.
Pinkie Pie,Me too. I'm sorry I put so much pressure on everypony to bond. I only wanted my friends to get to know my amazing older sister.
Pinkie Pie,What are you doing here?
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, we're so sorry we hurt your feelings by not bonding with Maud right away. And Maud, we're sorry that you felt the only way to spare Pinkie Pie's feelings was to leave Ponyville early."
Rest of main cast,Mm-hm.
Applejack,We've seen how much you care about Pinkie Pie firsthoof.
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie's happiness means as much to us as it does to you, and we're sorry we couldn't see it sooner. The thing that makes us click and creates a special bond between us is how much we all love Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, shucks!"
Twilight Sparkle,"That's a pretty great thing to have in common, if you ask me. What do you think, Maud?"
Maud Pie,Sure.
Pinkie Pie,What's wrong?
Rarity,"Sorry, darling. I think we all just thought she'd be a bit more excited about this."
Pinkie Pie,Are you kidding me? I've never seen her more excited in my entire life!
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't show my enthusiasm for things quite in the same way my sister does."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, we noticed. And we're totally cool with it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Maud, we'd like to give you something to take on your trip, so that you remember all your friends from Ponyville."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Thank you.
Twilight Sparkle,Are those all the necklaces Pinkie Pie sent you?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Mm-hm.
Twilight Sparkle,You haven't eaten any of them?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I don't really like candy. But I do love Pinkie Pie.
Pinkie Pie,[chewing] Mmm!
Sweetie Belle,"I have to leave for dress rehearsal soon, Rarity! Is it finished yet?"
Rarity,"Uh, not quite. I still feel it needs a certain je ne sais quoi. Perhaps it needs... appliqu<e9>s."
Sweetie Belle,Appliqu<e9>s?
Rarity,Or sequins.
Sweetie Belle,Sequins!
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle, I adore having you help me, truly I do, but..."
Sweetie Belle,Guess I got a little carried away. It's just that I know how important it is for you to finish this wardrobe in time for Sapphire Shores and her backup dancers.
Rarity,"This is without a doubt my most prestigious order ever. After all, Sapphire Shores is the pony of pop, and her Equestria-wide tour launches in Canterlot next week! Which means she must have these outfits by day after tomorrow at the latest!"
Sweetie Belle,But is there time?
Rarity,"Barely. But I work well under pressure. Hmm, as long as I stay calm, I'll be fine."
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, good! Then maybe you could check the stitching and finish the buttons on the dresses I made for me, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo? I really want them to look perfect, and... I think I need your expertise."
Rarity,"My, you've been so much help to me. How could I possibly say no? When do you need them?"
Sweetie Belle,Tomorrow night. For the opening night of our show!
Rarity,"But, Sweetie Belle, darling! I, I'm behind as it is!"
Sweetie Belle,I understand.
Rarity,"I suppose... if I got a few more ponies to help me, then maybe..."
Cheerilee,"My goodness, girls, it's time! And the audience is almost fully seated! Costumes!"
Scootaloo,I can't believe Rarity still isn't here with the costumes.
Sweetie Belle,She's been very busy lately!
Apple Bloom,"But how can she still not be here? She's known about this for weeks! Uh... she has known about this for weeks, right?"
Sweetie Belle,"I kept meaning to ask her, I really did, but I worked so hard on this play. I wrote it especially for the three of us! I directed it, I'm in it, I made the costumes... It's just that this is really my time to shine doing something completely myself, and I really wanted to keep it that way!"
Apple Bloom,But we wanted everything to be perfect! All our friends came out to see it tonight!
Cheerilee,Places!
Rarity,"Oh, I'm here, I'm here!"
Sweetie Belle,[gasps] You made it!
Rarity,"Oh, I beg your pardon for cutting it so close, but I made some improvements to your original design, and I had a terrible time with these froofy sleeves. It is for the first play you ever wrote, after all, so I made quite certain it came out just so."
Cheerilee,Places! Hello?
Sweetie Belle,"Forsooth and anon, I cometh forthwith and posthaste with glad tidings, miladies."
Apple Bloom,Wow! A standin' ovation!
Scootaloo,I still have goosebumps!
Apple Bloom,"This must be like a dream come true for you, huh, Sweetie Belle?"
Scootaloo,"Ooh, can you imagine if this show was how you got your cutie mark?"
Apple Bloom,"Which do you think you'd get it for? Writing, directing, or acting?"
Sweetie Belle,[deep breath] Let's not get carried away. We've got a whole lobby full of friends waiting to shower us with adoration and praise. Try to be gracious.
Scootaloo,Modest.
Apple Bloom,Classy.
Sweetie Belle,"Here we are, the stars of the show!"
Apple Bloom,You may tell us how much you loved it now.
Scootaloo,Line forms here!
Spike,"Wow, you guys! I think your sisters would have loved it!"
Apple Bloom,Would have?
Spike,"They're sorry, but they had to go help Rarity get Sapphire Shores' wardrobe ready to take to Canterlot in the morning."
Scootaloo,Even Rainbow Dash?
Spike,Yeah. Rarity fell way behind.
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,Aww.
Spike,"Aw, cheer up, the show was great! I'll get you some punch."
Sweetie Belle,At least everypony else who was able to stay loved it.
Sweetie Belle,"What did you all like best? The writing, the directing, or the acting?"
Lemon Hearts,"Oh my, I- I loved the dresses."
Noteworthy,I liked some of those lines you said.
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, really? Which ones?"
Noteworthy,"Uh, I don't really remember, but you were wearing a pink taffeta dress with lots of chiffon when you said them! Whoo-ee, that outfit was a dazzler!"
Noteworthy,That was a nice one too!
Sweetie Belle,[growls] Isn't there anypony here who remembers anything about the play besides the dresses?!
Fluttershy,All of this is one headpiece?
Rarity,"Indeed. This marvelous extravagance is the cr<e8>me de la cr<e8>me of the entire wardrobe! But alas, without this key hidden stitch, it's just a... I'm trying to think of a nicer way to say 'big bummer'. [sighs] Now perhaps we can all at last take a moment to relax!"
Rarity,"Whatever's the matter, Sweetie Belle? Didn't the play go all right?"
Sweetie Belle,Not even close.
Rarity,"Oh, dear. Was something amiss with the dresses I made you?"
Sweetie Belle,"No, they were perfect, and that was the whole problem!"
Others,"Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Huh?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, um, I think maybe I'll go take that moment to relax now."
Rainbow Dash,"Heh, sure do feel like relaxing!"
Applejack,Right behind ya!
Sweetie Belle,"How could you?! ""Oh, what amazing dresses! Oh, how I love the dresses! Ooh, dresses, dresses, dresses, dresses!"""
Rarity,"Oh, so they did like them. [chuckles] You had me worried, you silly filly."
Sweetie Belle,There! I knew it! You did this on purpose! Stealing the spotlight like you always do! It's my fifth birthday party all over again!
Rarity,The... the what now?
Sweetie Belle,Don't act like you don't remember. Or are you trying to prove you're a better actress than me too?!
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle, if I did anything to upset you, then--"
Sweetie Belle,Admit you made those dresses too good on purpose!
Rarity,I thought they were supposed to be good.
Sweetie Belle,"Yes, good. Not jaw-dropping amazing!"
Rarity,I only tried to do what I thought you wanted.
Sweetie Belle,Ha!
Sweetie Belle,"Ugh, I don't believe it. After everything I put up with all week long! [imitating Rarity] ""Sweetie Belle, get me some red ribbon! No, that's not red, that's cherry! No, that's not red, that's cinnamon!"" [normal, muffled] For Pete's sake, it's all red!"
Rarity,"[to Opalescence] I should probably go talk to her, hm?"
Sweetie Belle,"[muffled] At least Sapphire Shores won't be all like ""Ooh, who fetched you that red ribbon? Because I don't care about anything else you made. All I care about is that amazing red ribbon!"""
Rarity,Perhaps waiting would be best.
Sweetie Belle,[gulping water] I wish there was a way I could take back all the work I did!
Sweetie Belle,[growls] Now what?
Eclair Cr<e8>me,"And the winner of the ""Best Writer, Director, Actor in an Awesome Play Put on by a Pony and Her Awesome Best Friends"" goes to..."
Others,"""Star Gazer"": Sweetie Belle!"
Sweetie Belle,Don't go!
Sweetie Belle,Stop! Why do you have to ruin everything?!
Princess Luna,Enough!
Sweetie Belle,Princess Luna! It's really you! Or am I dreaming?
Princess Luna,What do you think?
Sweetie Belle,"Let me see. You just rescued me from a maniacal laughing Rarity-cloud. Yeah, probably dreaming."
Princess Luna,"I understand what you're going through, Sweetie Belle. I too have a sister who often shines more brightly than me, and with this, I have struggled."
Sweetie Belle,"Wait, come back! Luna? Can you hear me? Thank you for what you did! Help, Luna! Luuuna!"
Sweetie Belle,"I remember this. This is my fifth birthday party! I decided to make a grand entrance. I made myself all beautiful, just like my big sister."
Sweetie Belle,"Finally, I was perfect, and then went to the stairs to enter like the belle of the ball. When I finally came out of my room, I found the party going on without me."
Sweetie Belle,"And I kept posing at the top of the stairs, waiting to be noticed, but all I heard was..."
Little Pony 2,Awesome! Where did you get these?
Rarity,"Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?"
Little Pony 2,"You're the greatest, Rarity!"
Others,"""Plum Star"": Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister?"
Sweetie Belle,That's when I learned 'never try to shine with my big sister around'.
Princess Luna,But perhaps you didn't have the whole story.
Sweetie Belle,I thought you said you understood? Luna?
Little Pony 2,Where's Sweetie Belle?
Rarity,I'm sure she'll be along in any moment.
Others,"""Titania"": [yawns] I'm tired of waiting. I say we get out of here before we all keel over from boredom. Who's with me? Poor Sweetie Belle. Nopony's gonna come to another one of her parties after this fiasco."
Rarity,"Don't go! You'll miss out on the, uh, party favors! I was going to save them 'til the end, but..."
Little Pony 2,Awesome? Where did you get these?
Rarity,"Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?"
Others,"""Plum Star"": Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister?"
Rarity,"Oh, no-no-no. All of these things were Sweetie Belle's idea. I just assisted with the execution."
Sweetie Belle,I guess Rarity wasn't trying to steal the spotlight. She was trying to save my party. Luna? Luna!
Rarity,"Should I hem the cloaks now or wait until I'm there? I could hem them now, but I might have to redo them..."
Sweetie Belle,When was this?
Rarity,"But if I wait until I'm in Canterlot to hem them, Sapphire Shores might not get the best first impression..."
Sweetie Belle,Wait. This must've happened earlier tonight!
Rarity,Ooh... Sapphire Shores is such a big star and such a stickler for details. What if everything's not perfect enough?
Sweetie Belle,"Funny, I thought I was the only one who got worried about stuff like that."
Rarity,"Oh, buck up, Rarity, stop this foolishness. You've done your best and left nothing to chance! All that's needed now is a good night's rest."
Sweetie Belle,[sighs] I hope everything goes alright for her tomorrow.
Princess Luna,Hm. How curious you should say that.
Princess Luna,"Go. Go see what the future holds if you fail to rein in your worst instincts, as I once did."
Rarity,And here it is! The cr<e8>me de la cr<e8>me--
Sweetie Belle,Noooo!
Rarity,The pi<e9>ce de resistance...
Rarity,The headdress!
Sapphire Shores,Looks like I made a mistake here.
Rarity,"But, but this is impossible! I, I, I checked and rechecked everything! This couldn't have happened!"
Sapphire Shores,"You sure about that, honey?"
Rarity,"Please, you must believe me!"
Sweetie Belle,Listen to my sister!
Sweetie Belle,[screams] I don't wanna see any more!
Rarity,Always check and recheck!
Sapphire Shores,Who all wants to hear a funny story about my ex-costume designer?
Rarity,"Check, recheck, recheck, then recheck!"
Sweetie Belle,"Make it stop! Princess Luna, can you hear me?!"
Fluttershy,"Make me a dress, Rarity, please?"
Rarity,Go away! You know I don't do that anymore!
Sweetie Belle,"Wake me up, Princess Luna, wake me up, wake me uuuup!"
Sweetie Belle,Rarity? [gasps] Oh no! The box is... gone? I'm too late! She left for Canterlot!
Sweetie Belle,The key is for you two to distract Rarity long enough for me to put the stitch back in without her noticing.
Scootaloo,If we're not too late already.
Apple Bloom,"Oh, my gosh! I can't believe we're goin' to see Sapphire Shores! I'm such a huge fan! I know all her songs!"
Scootaloo,'Get Your Pony On'!
Apple Bloom,"Ooh, that's one of my favorites!"
Sweetie Belle,This isn't a trip to see Sapphire Shores! It's a trip to save my sister from a horrible future!
Scootaloo,'Serves Her Right'!
Sweetie Belle,[gasps] How can you say that?! Rarity doesn't deserve that at all!
Scootaloo,"No, 'Serves Her Right' is another one of Sapphire Shores' songs!"
Apple Bloom,You seriously didn't know that? Don't you listen to her music?!
Sweetie Belle,...I prefer show tunes.
Scootaloo and Apple Bloom,Ugh.
Sapphire Shores,"Five, six, seven eight, ba-bam!"
Rarity,"Oh, bravo! Fabulous! Magnifique!"
Sapphire Shores,"One more time, from the top. Let's not embarrass me in front of my favorite designer this time? And a-one, two, three, four!"
Sweetie Belle,But you have to let us in! I'm Sapphire Shores' designer's sister! You have to believe us!
Security guard,"Kid, the only thing I have to do is make sure Sapphire Shores doesn't get interrupted all day by fans like you."
Sweetie Belle,But I'm not a fan!
Apple Bloom,I am!
Scootaloo,Me too!
Sweetie Belle,Not helping!
Sapphire Shores,"Now, that's how I like it! You rocked it, girls! Get some water and be back in ten. Rar-i-ty, come on up here and show me what you brought me. Sapphire wants to see it and love it!"
Scootaloo,[straining] Almost...
Scootaloo,Oof!
Sweetie Belle,"We've gotta get in there, now!"
Sapphire Shores,Okay then. Liking what I see so far. So is this the whole shebang?
Rarity,"Actually, I saved the best for last!"
Rarity,And here it is!
Sweetie Belle,You gotta see this with the cinnamon ribbon! You'll love it!
Rarity,Sweetie Belle?!
Sapphire Shores,You know her?
Rarity,Uh... [laughs nervously] Ahem. Just a moment!
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, good! This is just a dream!"
Princess Luna,"Actually, no. This is very much real."
Sweetie Belle,"[sighs] Oh, Luna... I wish none of this ever happened... What am I gonna do?"
Princess Luna,Let's begin with this. And I think I know how you can even improve it.
Rarity,"I would like to know what in the wide, wide realm of Equestria this stunt of yours is all about, and I want to know now! Do you have any idea how important this job is to me?"
Sweetie Belle,"Actually, I do. I was upset at you for stealing the spotlight from me at the play, so I pulled out the center stitch to the headpiece so it would fall apart."
Rarity,What?!
Sweetie Belle,"But then I realized I didn't want your future to be ruined forever and ever, so I came back to change it before it was too late! So... here it is. It's all fixed. Please forgive me."
Rarity,Wait... what is this?
Sweetie Belle,Trust me. Sapphire Shores is gonna love it.
Sapphire Shores,"Rarity, this isn't going to work out. You don't get to my level of success without learning to read the signs, and this situation has bad luck written all over it."
Rarity,I promise you'll absolutely adore the headdress as soon as you see it.
Sapphire Shores,"My, it is attractive, but..."
Sweetie Belle,"Look at the stitching, real close."
Sapphire Shores,"Well, I'll be. It's a dolphin! That's my lucky animal! They swim with me in my dreams."
Rarity,Wherever did you come up with the idea for a dolphin?
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, it just came to me... in a dream. I'm sorry I got jealous about those dresses. I know now that you were only trying to help."
Rarity,"Oh, Sweetie, I forgive you! But I never did get to see your play. Any chance I could catch an encore performance?"
Sweetie Belle,"Uh, I don't think the play went all that good. To be honest, the costumes were the best part."
Rarity,Awww!
Apple Bloom,Just one more time? Please?
Applejack,"Alright, but this is the last one."
Apple Bloom,Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Woooo!
Granny Smith,[spluttering] Who done that?!
Apple Bloom,"Sure wish you'd come swim with us, Granny."
Granny Smith,"Uh, sorry, dear. I just can't bring myself anywhere near that there swimmin' hole."
Apple Bloom,How come?
Granny Smith,"Well, I wasn't always this way..."
Granny Smith,"Time was, I was an aquapony all-star! In fact, I was the only Apple to ever come close to breaking the Equestria high-diving record! Falling six stories into a deep dish pie pan takes a toll on the hindquarters. Oh, I was so sore, took years before I could even look at the water again! Just the idea of swimmin' makes my whole body ache! Besides, these old legs can't even paddle fast enough to stay afloat."
Apple Bloom,"Boy, I sure would hate to be afraid of swimmin'. You think I'll ever be scared of the water?"
Apple Bloom,Aah!
Big McIntosh,Nope.
Apple Bloom,"Wow, Granny. I can't believe you were a high diver!"
Granny Smith,The best one in Ponyville!
Apple Bloom,Do you think I could be a high diver?
Big McIntosh,Nope.
Applejack,Absolutely not.
Apple Bloom,But<U+0096>
Granny Smith,"Now you hold your horsefeathers, little seed! I never said bein' a high diver was a smart decision! It's incredibly dangerous!"
Apple Bloom,"I know, but<U+0096>"
Granny Smith,"But nothin'! It is the riskiest, scariest, darn-fool thing I ever did do! That's not to say I didn't wish I was still young and spry and confident, but let's leave the flyin' through the air to the Pegasi."
Apple Bloom,"Wow, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound so fun."
Applejack,Wow. I wonder where everypony's headed.
Applejack,Now where in Ponyville do you two think you're goin'?
Granny Smith,"Aw, quit bein' such a worry-worm and follow your ears!"
Apple Bloom,"Come on, Applejack, aren't you curious?"
Flim,"Thank you, one and all, for your attendance, and we guarantee that your time here will not be spent in vain!"
Flam,"In fact, we think it will prove to be the most valuable time you've ever spent!"
Applejack,The Flim Flam Brothers! This should be interestin'.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Flim,"Welcome, one and all, to the demonstration of a lifetime!"
Flam,A demonstration of a better life!
Flim,"A demonstration of a better time! And if we haven't captured your interest just yet, by the time we've finished, an unfortunate phenomenon practically guarantees that we will!"
Flam,A phenomenon? What's that?
Flim,"It's a circumstance perceptible by the senses, but in this case, it's the simple fact that:"
Others,There's ailments all around us in everything we touch and see
Flam,A sickness that lies waiting there in every breath you breathe
Flim,Disease will up and grab you as it crawls from land and sea
Flam,It's amazing how infected that the natural world and all its things can be
Flim,Now I understand that some of you don't think you're sick.
Flam,But twisted hooves and aching joints don't heal all that quick.
Flim,Consider just how dangerous this world is! You might...
Flam,"Slip and fall, break or sprain something here tonight"
Flim and Flam,"But luckily for you, we've got the thing you need And it's easier when all you need's the cure The Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic Is just what the doctor ordered, I'm sure"
Flim,Now I know our claims seem fantastical.
Flam,Impractical.
Flim,Improbable.
Flam,Impossible.
Flim and Flam,And magical!
Flim,So we welcome every suffering pony to make their way up to the stage.
Flam,Now don't crowd.
Flim,And we'll prove our tonic's effectiveness before your very eyes.
Flam,"You there! Come up here, good sir."
Flim,"I'll wager you're tired of those crutches, my friend."
Flam,Try taking a sip of this!
Flim and Flam,"That's why you're so lucky we've got the thing for you Just come on up, we've always got some more Of the Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic"
Silver Shill,I won't need these crutches to dance out the door
Granny Smith,Now how do ya like that?
Applejack,I don't. There's somethin' funny about this whole thing.
Flim,"Now some of you may suffer from feelings of despair You're old, you're tired, your legs won't work, there's graying in your hair"
Flam,"Just listen and I'll tell you that you don't need to fear Your ears will work, your muscles tone, your eyes will see so clear"
Crowd,"Luckily for us, you've got the thing we need The answer to our problems in a jar The Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic Is the greatest ever miracle by far!"
in background,Tonic... tonic... tonic...
Flim,"It cures the reins, the spurs, and the Clydesdale fur blight."
Flam,Hooferia and horsentery cured in just a night.
Flim,You've got swollen hooves and hindquarters or terrible bridle-bit cleft.
Flam,Saunter sitz and gallop plop will give your tail some heft.
Flim,"Mane loss, hay fever, or terrible tonsillitis."
Flam,"You heard it here, folks -- this is the only place in all of Equestria you'll find it!"
Flim,"It can make you shorter, taller, or even grow old"
Flam,But who'd want that?
Flim,When with one drink
Flim and Flam,You can be young again<U+0096>
Granny Smith,SOLD!
Flim,"Congratulations, Granny Smith! You just made the purchase of a lifetime!"
Applejack,Are you as worried as I am?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"Boy, I just can't believe all the things that Flim Flam Tonic can do!"
Applejack,"When somepony says somethin's too good to be true, it usually is."
Apple Bloom,You mean Granny wasted her money?
Applejack,"Well, I don't know about that, but I don't think there's a tonic in Equestria that can make an old pony young again."
Granny Smith,Howdy!
Apple Bloom,Granny?!
Applejack,Hang on now! We'll get ya!
Apple Bloom,"Granny, I thought you were too afraid of the water to swim! And, and what about your hip?!"
Granny Smith,"Well, I reckon it might have been a problem before I had myself a dose of that there Flim Flam Tonic!"
Applejack,I'm not so sure that tonic really does anythin'.
Applejack,"I'm glad you're feelin' good, but how do you know it's from the tonic?"
Granny Smith,"I looked out at the water this mornin' and I felt the same terrifyin' aches and pains I always do. But one sip of that magic elixir and it all went away! Why, I might even get a head start on my chores! What do you say, Big Mac-a-doo? Up for a little afternoon applebuckin'?"
Big McIntosh,"Uh, no."
Granny Smith,"Oh, quit your bellyachin'!"
Apple Bloom,"Gee, it looks like that tonic works after all! I wonder what's in it."
Applejack,I think maybe it's time we found out.
Apple Bloom,So you're just gonna walk up and ask them how it works?
Applejack,"I guess. Though if it's a genuine cure, I don't suppose they'll be too keen on sharin' the recipe."
Silver Shill,<U+0096>out the door!
Apple Bloom,Wait a second! That's that same pony from before!
Applejack,Hey!
Applejack,"Now hold it right there, Mister...?"
Silver Shill,"Shill. Silver Shill. Ooh, what do you two want?"
Applejack,Our Granny took some tonic and we want to know how it works.
Apple Bloom,"Granny couldn't swim before, and now she can. Just like you couldn't walk and now you can. But what are you doin' back here? I mean, if the tonic cured you and all..."
Applejack,"...Because he's part of the act! It's time for you to tell the truth! You never needed crutches at all, did ya?"
Silver Shill,"I, uh..."
Applejack,Hey! Huh?
Flim,"Well, if it isn't our most favorite Apple!"
Flam,What brings you back to our humble abode?
Applejack,"You two charlatans sold my Granny a bottle of tonic, and now she's off actin' like a filly again."
Flim,What's so bad about that?
Applejack,"If she keeps gallavantin' around like a yearlin', she's apt to drop from exhaustion or worse! What's more, I know for a fact that your friend here is dressin' up as a different pony every night so he can pretend to be cured!"
Flam,"Well, well, well, that's quite an accusation."
Flim,But let's say that it's true...
Flam,Hypothetically...
Flim,Theoretically...
Flam,"As I understand, your Granny was a famous aquapony."
Flim,"The star of the show, once upon a time."
Flam,But hasn't set so much as a hoof in the water since.
Applejack,"Until today, that's right."
Flim,"Well, then even if our tonic were nothing more than a mixture of apple juice and beet leaves..."
Flam,Hypothetically...
Flim,Theoretically...
Flam,The fact is that Granny is happier now than before she tried it.
Applejack,I guess...
Flim,"So, the question is..."
Flam,Do you really want to be the pony who takes all that happiness away?
Applejack,I...
Apple Bloom,There you are! I've been lookin' all over! Did you find out what's in the tonic?
Applejack,"Honestly, Apple Bloom... as long as it works, I... don't suppose it really matters."
Apple Bloom,"Well, if it doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter to me either, sis."
Flim,That's the spirit!
Flam,Come back anytime!
Apple Bloom,"Hey, Granny! Think you can buck me over the water?"
Granny Smith,"I don't see why not! Come on, Big Mac, toss her this way!"
Applejack,"Granny, wait!"
Granny Smith,Woo-hoo-hoo!
Granny Smith,"Uh, what were you sayin', dear?"
Applejack,"Granny, don't you think you should take it kinda easy?"
Granny Smith,"I've been takin' it easy for too long! And now, thanks to that Flim Flam Tonic, I don't have to!"
Apple Bloom,"Granny, you think I could be an aquapony like you?"
Granny Smith,"Of course you can, sapling. There's nothin' to it but to do it!"
Apple Bloom,"Well, the Ponyville swim meet is comin' up. We could enter together! A legendary water pony like you? We'd be a cinch to win!"
Granny Smith,"Mm, ee, uh, I don't know... Bein' back in the water is one thing, but a competition is a pony of a different color."
Apple Bloom,Oh. Okay.
Applejack,"I don't know, Granny. A swim meet sounds pretty safe. And after all, if that tonic lets you swim in a river and a swimmin' hole, a pool should be no problem at all."
Granny Smith,"Well, I'll be a tart turnover, you are right! All we need now is more tonic!"
Flam,"Welcome, friends, and step right up! The next show starts in five minutes!"
Flim,But why not buy your tonic now and avoid the rush?
Flam,"Right this way, good sir!"
Granny Smith,We'll take the whole case!
Others,"""Jinx"": Are you saying this stuff actually works?"
Applejack,It seems to work for Granny.
Flim,"You heard it here first, folks! Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic is Granny Smith-tested and Applejack-approved!"
Others,"""Jinx"": If Applejack says it works, that's good enough for me!"
Apple Bloom and Granny Smith,"Hoo-ha, hee-hee, ha-hoo-ha!"
Applejack,"Just remember, you two. The most important thing is to be safe and have fun, right?"
Granny Smith,"Fiddlesticks! With the routine we've been workin' on, I'll be a plum puddin' if we don't win this thing!"
Applejack,"Uh... good luck, then!"
Granny Smith,"Luck? Pfft, who needs luck? We got tonic on our side!"
Flam,Flim Flam's Magical Curative Tonic!
Flim,Get your Applejack-approved tonic! Granny Smith drinks it <U+0096> why shouldn't you?
Applejack,[sighs] Right.
Granny Smith,"Now, if'n you'll excuse us, we got some swimmin' to do!"
Applejack,"Well, I'll be..."
Granny Smith,"Yeah, but mostly it's the tonic!"
Flim,"That's Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic, to be precise."
Flam,Buy it now while supplies last.
Applejack,What are you doin' here?
Silver Shill,"Oh, things are going so well, Flim and Flam gave me a promotion! Just made my first bit as a salespony. No more costumes for this pony. [beat] This is more of a uniform."
Applejack,If you say so.
Silver Shill,"I used to wonder if I was doing the right thing. You know, pretending to be cured, basically lying to folks about this tonic. But thanks to you, I realized that sometimes honesty isn't the best policy."
Applejack,Thanks to... me?
Apple Bloom,"With Flim Flam's magical Curative Tonic, my Granny can do anything! Just ask Applejack!"
Applejack,"No! This has gotta stop! If ponies keep believin' that tonic can do things it can't, who knows what'll happen?"
Silver Shill,Maybe something like that?
Applejack,[gasps] Granny! What in blazes does she think she's doin'?!
Apple Bloom,Granny's gonna break the Equestria high divin' record!
Applejack,Land sakes!
Granny Smith,[yelps] Now what in tarnation did you do that for?!
Applejack,That was the most fool-pony thing I've ever seen anypony do in all my life! You can't do a dive like that!
Granny Smith,"Oh, quit your fussin'! I had enough tonic to do a dive ten times as high!"
Flim,"Twenty times, by my count."
Flam,"Thirty, with a favorable breeze."
Applejack,"I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!"
Others,"""Jinx"": But you gave it your stamp of approval!"
Rainbowshine,Are you saying you lied?
Applejack,...I am.
Applejack,"I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope with time, I can win back everypony's trust."
Apple Bloom,"But if the tonic is a fake, then how come Granny can swim again, and what about all that aquabatics stuff we just did?"
Applejack,"I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're capable of, and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember that it was inside of you all along. But tellin' ponies your tonic can do things it can't is just wrong!"
Flim,But you just said it boosts confidence!
Flam,"And that's not all it does, folks<U+0096>"
Silver Shill,"Yes, it is! In fact, it's not a tonic at all! I know, 'cause I helped make it! Watching Applejack save Granny and then admit to lying, well, that made me realize I was making ponies believe in a thing that just wasn't so!"
Applejack,"Believin' in somethin' can help you do amazin' things. But if that belief is based on a lie, eventually it's gonna lead to real trouble."
Silver Shill,"Thank you, Applejack. I got this through dishonest means. That was a mistake I won't be making again! I'd like you to have it, as a reminder of how you helped me finally see the truth."
Applejack,I don't know...
Silver Shill,"Oh, don't worry. I'll track down the pony I sold that worthless tonic to and give him another bit to replace this one! Honest."
Applejack,"I'm sorry, Granny. I hope this doesn't mean you'll stop swimmin'."
Granny Smith,"Why in tarnation would I do that? I just can't believe those two salesponies had me believin' I could near fly! Hey, where'd they go?"
Applejack,"Bein' honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about. But I think believin' a lie can end up hurtin' even more. Maybe some ponies don't care about that <U+0096> but I sure ain't one of them. Now you take it easy there, Granny!"
Granny Smith,"Oh, I plan to! Hoo, ha, ha-whee!"
Twilight Sparkle,[reading] The magical properties of this spell will only have lasting effects if you focus on<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,No! Rainbow Dash! [grunts] How in Equestria does that pony expect to pass her history of the Wonderbolts exam tomorrow if she's wasting time flying?! I'm just gonna fly right up to her and tell her what I think about her lackadaisical approach to studying! Won't she be surprised!
Rainbow Dash,Surprise!
Twilight Sparkle,What? Huh? How did you<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"Puh-lease, Twilight. That was the worst sneak attack ever."
Twilight Sparkle,Wha? But<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,I saw you giving me the stink-eye from the ground and heard you flying towards me and muttering from a mile away.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, if you heard me ""muttering"", then you must know what I was ""muttering"" about."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, yeah, the Wonderbolts history test. No big deal."
Twilight Sparkle,"No. Big deal. Really big deal. It's a test! A test that will determine if you can join the newly-formed Wonderbolts Reserves, and being part of the Wonderbolts Reserves means you'll have the opportunity to live your dream as a Wonderbolt! This is the most important test of your life!"
Rainbow Dash,"Twilight, not everypony gets all freaked out about tests like you."
Twilight Sparkle,"I do not get ""all freaked out"" about tests!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, seriously? Your freakouts are so epic, you sing whole freakout arias about freaking out."
Twilight Sparkle,"Fine, I may tend to take my tests a little seriously, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be studying for yours! Oooh! And I know just the pony who can help you: me! This is gonna be so much fun!"
Rainbow Dash,Sure. Fun.
Rainbow Dash,[yelps] Wha<U+0096> huh?
Twilight Sparkle,This is the most complete<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,And ginormous!
Twilight Sparkle,<U+0097>book on the history of the Wonderbolts.
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, but how am I supposed to get what's in there into here?"
Twilight Sparkle,"With my handy-dandy study checklist, of course!"
Rainbow Dash,Of course.
Twilight Sparkle,"First up, reading and highlighting. Reading and highlighting is the foundation of any good study method. It allows the student to hone in and boil down on what's really important, separating the good from the bad, the wheat from the chaff, getting to the crux of things. Let's see what you've got so far!"
Rainbow Dash,Um...
Twilight Sparkle,"Huh? Hm, by highlighting everything, you don't really separate the wheat from the chaff... Or the good from the bad. Hey, I am not that tall!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Okay, Rainbow, clearly reading and highlighting is not your style of studying, so let's move on to the tried and true: History lecture! Yes, Rainbow?"
Rainbow Dash,Is it snack time?
Twilight Sparkle,No.
Rainbow Dash,Recess?
Twilight Sparkle,No.
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Can't we just watch the history of the Wonderbolts movie?!
Twilight Sparkle,"No! Now, just get comfortable, and experience the magic of learning. Ahem. Prior to the great Celestia/Luna rift, there was no need for the Earth, Unicorn, Pegasi, or E.U.P., Guard."
Twilight Sparkle,"But after Luna's banishment, the Protective Pony Platoons were formed. On the anniversary of the first Celestial year of peace, a celebration was held."
Twilight Sparkle,"Headed by General Firefly, an elite team of aerial performers were chosen to help celebrate this auspicious occasion. The first performance was so full of energy, so highly charged, that magical lightning showered down on the crowd. Everypony was so filled with amazement and wonder that General Firefly dubbed them ""the Wonderbolts""!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, can you repeat any of my lesson?"
Twilight Sparkle,"History lecture... nope. [sighs] Okay, Rainbow<U+0096> Rainbow? Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,Here!
Twilight Sparkle,Let's move on to my favorite style of learning: flashcards!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, does that mean I'll learn in a flash?"
Twilight Sparkle,"One can only hope. [inhales] Colonel Purple Dart, the leader of the Wonderbolts in the Fourth Celestial Era, was known for his<U+0096> wha?! Rainbow! Did you see what happened?"
Rainbow Dash,What? No! I was... riveted by your captivating cards!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hmm... After becoming the official flying squadron for Princess Celestia, she honored them with<U+0096> Gotcha!"
Rainbow Dash,Got what?
Twilight Sparkle,"The original Wonderbolts lightning bolt insignia was<U+0096> [yelps] Rainbow Dash, you could've hurt me!"
Rainbow Dash,With a spit wad? Really?
Twilight Sparkle,A spit wad to the eye would have been no laughing matter!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, if you can horse around like this, then you clearly must be ready for the test."
Rainbow Dash,Clearly.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well then, I guess you're also ready for a..."
Twilight Sparkle,Pop quiz!
Rainbow Dash,Bring it!
Twilight Sparkle,The initials E.U.P. stand for what?
Rainbow Dash,Ernie's undercooked pancakes.
Twilight Sparkle,The original aerial team performed for...?
Rainbow Dash,Celestia's cereal celebration.
Twilight Sparkle,The Wonderbolts were given their name by this famous Pegasus. Who is she? [to herself] Please don't say Colonel Waffle...
Rainbow Dash,"Hello? General Blazing Donut Glaze! [scoffs] So, did I ace it or what?"
Twilight Sparkle,Or what. You didn't get one answer correct.
Rainbow Dash,What? But<U+0096> but how?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know. I've never heard answers so wrong! And so breakfast-related!
Twilight Sparkle,If you had taken the official test today...
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] My dreams of being in the Wonderbolts Reserve would have been totally crushed! [gasps] What am I gonna do? I'm running out of time! I don't know any of this history! I'm gonna fail!
Rainbow Dash,"I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail! And it's all your fault!"
Twilight Sparkle,My fault?! I'm the one helping you!
Rainbow Dash,"Maybe your famous study methods aren't all they're cracked up to be, eh, teacher?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Excuse me, I've used them to study for many a test and passed!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, right."
Twilight Sparkle,Do you know the name of the premiere Wonderbolts choreographer?
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, well<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,Commander Easyglider. Do you know how many Pegasi flew in the original squad?
Rainbow Dash,Um<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,Seven! Do you know Princess Celestia's favorite flight pattern?! The Icaranian Sun Salutation! See? I could pass the test.
Rainbow Dash,"Fine! Rub it in, why don't ya? Besides, I don't see why I have to take this lousy test anyway. I've proven I'm one of the best flyers around."
Twilight Sparkle,Knowing their origin and being able to properly represent them for all of Equestria is just as important.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, right. Some history buff like you must have made that up to bring us flyers down."
Twilight Sparkle,"Knowing history actually is beneficial, Rainbow."
Rainbow Dash,[blows raspberry] Beneficial for eggheads!
Fluttershy,Girls.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, this egghead knows history and can fly. Maybe I should become a Wonderbolt."
Rainbow Dash,"Just 'cause you've got wings, doesn't mean you can fly!"
Fluttershy,Girls!
Rainbow Dash,You're barely able to just get off the ground!
Fluttershy,"Girls! Stop! Now, is that any way to talk to a friend?"
Twilight Sparkle,Sorry.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, sorry."
Fluttershy,Don't you have more important things to do? Like prepare Rainbow for her big test?
Twilight Sparkle,"I've tried everything, Fluttershy, but none of my study methods work for her."
Fluttershy,"Well, no offense to your teaching methods, Twilight, but I think I may have a way to help Rainbow."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, who's that, who's that?"
Fluttershy,"Celestia and Luna, back when they were happy."
Rainbow Dash,Uh... now what?
Fluttershy,"Gummy's an Earth pony, Winona's a unicorn, and Tank is a Pegasus."
Twilight Sparkle,"They're the E.U.P., helping to protect the Princess."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, how are you getting all this?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, no!"
Rainbow Dash,"Stop, stop, stop! That was aw<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"Awesome! I give it three woohoo's! Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo! And an extra ""woo"" for good measure! Woo!"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I give it a ""whoa, whoa, what?"" I'm totally confused and I just wanna go home... Whoa<U+0096> hey!"
Pinkie Pie,"Whoa your woes there, woeful. Some ponies learn through theatrical presentation, but other ponies learn through musical intervention."
Pinkie Pie,"[beatboxing, turntable scratching noises] Well, back in ancient times, there were the Wonderbolts of old A general named Firefly, amazing and so..."
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] Bold!"
Pinkie Pie,"She brought them all together, spreading unity..."
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] In flight!"
Pinkie Pie,Performing at their very best with wonder...
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] And with might!"
Pinkie Pie,There's Admiral Fairweather and the Colonel Purple...
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] Dart!"
Pinkie Pie,Gave Wonderbolts a bit of steel along with...
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] Lots of heart!"
Pinkie Pie,An admiral named Fairy Flight and general called...
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] Flash!"
Pinkie Pie,Helped the 'bolts fly super high...
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] With style and panache!"
Pinkie Pie,Commander Easyglider was the real cream of...
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] The crop!"
Pinkie Pie,"For with her wicked moves, the Wonderbolts..."
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] Soared to the top!"
Pinkie Pie,"Wonderbolts, yeah! Wonderbolts..."
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] Huh!"
Pinkie Pie,"Wonderbolts, yeah! Wonderbolts..."
Others,"[Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr. Hooves] Unh!"
Pinkie Pie,That is my rappin' history of the Wonderbolts!
Pinkie Pie,"So, d'you get it?"
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, Pinkie Pie! [poorly imitating rap-style sounds] General This and Colonel That, they're the Wonderbolts, something that rhymes with that!"
Pinkie Pie,That... was pretty terrible.
Rainbow Dash,What?! No... really? But I've gotta learn this stuff! Now!
Rarity,And I am just the pony to help!
Rainbow Dash,"Rarity, you look ridiculous."
Rarity,I am going to ignore that comment out of my desire to help you.
Rainbow Dash,Good luck.
Rarity,"Get ready, Rainbow Dash, for I am going to take you on an historical adventure in fashion! I am now modeling the rather unattractive, and frankly itchy, original Wonderbolts flying costume. Fortunately, thanks to the vision of Flair d'Mare, the Wonderbolts ensemble became more streamlined in a wonderfully breathable fabric. Of course, there were fashion hits... and misses. Just look at those dreadful bell-bottoms. What were ponies thinking?"
Pinkie Pie,I dunno. I bet General Flash rocked these thangs!
Rainbow Dash,"[yelps] Pinkie, you're real!"
Pinkie Pie,"Of course I'm real! I mean I'm not the real General Flash, the tenth leader of the Wonderbolts, but I, Pinkie, am really real."
Fluttershy,"And I'm Admiral Fairy Flight, from the seventh squadron."
Twilight Sparkle,And of course you recognize Commander Easyglider.
Applejack,And I'm sportin' some sort of getup worn by Colonel Purple Dart.
Rarity,Just look at us.
Twilight Sparkle,Look at us.
Pinkie Pie,Look at me!
Rainbow Dash,It's too much for my eyes!
Applejack,"Now, don't you fret, Rainbow. This fashion show nonsense wouldn't help me learn nothin', either."
Rainbow Dash,"Really? Well, what special study trick do you have, AJ?"
Applejack,"Who, me? Oh, I got nothing."
Applejack,"Why, I could tell you every little thing there is to know about the history of apples, but I picked all that up over years in the field as a labor of love. How much time you got?"
Rainbow Dash,Twelve hours.
Applejack,"Oh, then you are up a creek."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I think we should just go back to old-fashioned studying."
Fluttershy,What about our play?
Rarity,Just look at these costumes! Surely something resonates with your inner Wonderbolt!
Applejack,"And Granny Smith discovered the first granny smith in Fillydelphia, when she was just a filly!"
Pinkie Pie,Commander Easyglider was the real cream of the crop<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, stop rapping! That isn't gonna help Rainbow!"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, I suggest you put down your silly cards of flash, For I know that they cannot help our good friend Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,"Enough! No rapping, no cards, no costumes, no play, and no apples! I am never gonna pass this test, ever! Just forget it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[panting] Rainbow, I'm sorry about all that! We didn't mean to overwhelm you!"
Rainbow Dash,It's okay. You were just trying to help. It's just too bad I'm too dumb to learn anything.
Twilight Sparkle,You are not dumb! You just learn differently!
Rainbow Dash,"If by ""differently"" you mean ""not at all"", then you're totally right."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, that's totally wrong."
Rainbow Dash,See? Wrong again.
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know anypony that's read more Daring Do books than you.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, that's not going to get me into the Wonderbolts."
Twilight Sparkle,And your knowledge of jokes and pranks is only rivaled by Pinkie.
Rainbow Dash,Great. My years of being a class clown prevented me from actually learning how to learn!
Twilight Sparkle,"That's not what I meant. You're smart, creative, inventive, and<U+0096> ugh! Hey! I know you're upset, but you don't need to<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,Whoa... I almost slammed into that!
Rainbow Dash,I know. You were jabbering on so much you didn't even notice.
Twilight Sparkle,But how did you notice? You were listening and talking to me the whole time!
Rainbow Dash,"Ha-hah, you're such a rookie. An experienced flyer like me knows how to multitask."
Twilight Sparkle,While you fly?
Rainbow Dash,"It's essential! Yes, I was paying attention to you, but was also scanning the sky and the ground for any problems."
Twilight Sparkle,Really?
Rainbow Dash,Flying's not just flying!
Rainbow Dash,"In order to stay safe in the sky, I've got to hear and see everything down to the littlest details. For instance, I saw Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo come out of Sugarcube Corner, and from the looks of it, they had carrot cupcakes with sprinkles. And I'm thinking Big Mac sold a huge order of apples to Filthy Rich, 'cause I heard him give a very hearty<U+0097>"
Big McIntosh and Rainbow Dash,"""Eeyup""."
Rainbow Dash,I always make note of everything when I fly. No biggie.
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Oh, my gosh!"
Rainbow Dash,What?
Twilight Sparkle,Gotta go!
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks for meeting me, everypony."
Applejack,"What is it, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,We have to help Rainbow Dash.
Fluttershy,"Yes, but how?"
Rarity,"We've tried every kind of studying. My way, your way..."
Twilight Sparkle,But we haven't tried Rainbow Dash's way.
Pinkie Pie,"Hmm, I'm intrigued."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Rainbow. Wanna go for a fly?"
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Sure. Got nothing better to do. Didn't we just do this?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, but like you said, I'm such a newbie, I need all the practice I can get."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll become a great flyer in no time. After all, you're good at everything."
Twilight Sparkle,So... what's going on?
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, nothing. Just getting my dreams crushed."
Twilight Sparkle,Uh... read any good books lately?
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Just history books. I'd tell you what they were about, but my brain is as dry as a rock."
Rainbow Dash,Maybe I'll go work there as I have no other plans for the rest of my life.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, come on now, Rainbow. You can't give up on your dream!"
Rainbow Dash,"Seems my dream has given up on me. Maybe I'll learn to shine shoes, sell hats, dig ditches..."
Twilight Sparkle,Or maybe you'll be a Wonderbolt.
Rainbow Dash,"Twilight, give it up! I have."
Twilight Sparkle,"So, what do you remember about that flight?"
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Nothing important. Except after Luna was banished to the moon, Celestia needed protective forces, so Earth, unicorn, and Pegasi formed the E.U.P. Guard of the Protective Pony Platoons."
Twilight Sparkle,Yes...?
Rainbow Dash,"[getting happier] And, at the celebration of the first Celestial year of peace, an elite flying squadron performed, headed by General Firefly, who later named the group the Wonderbolts!"
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-huh...?
Rainbow Dash,Commander Easyglider established flight choreography that is still used by the Wonderbolts today!
Twilight Sparkle,Yes!
Rainbow Dash,I... I know the history! I know it all! But how in Equestria did that happen?
Twilight Sparkle,You learned it!
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I got that! But how?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, on our first flight, I discovered that you catalog everything that happens all around you when you're flying, without even thinking about it! Don't you see?"
Twilight Sparkle,I made use of your special skills by enlisting everypony to help you learn the history of the Wonderbolts!
Fluttershy,"I, Princess Celestia, banish you, Princess Luna, to the moon."
Rarity,Noooooo!
Apple Bloom,Earth!
Sweetie Belle,Unicorn!
Scootaloo,Pegasus!
Apple Bloom,E!
Sweetie Belle,U!
Scootaloo,P!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Fluttershy,Let us celebrate our first Celestial year of peace!
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, let's party! I'm General Firefly! Gee, my costume is itchy and unattractive, but I'm gonna assemble an awesome flying team!"
Pinkie Pie,I'll call them... the Wonderbolts!
Rarity,Streamlined style by Flair d'Mare!
Others,S04E21 Unnamed Pegasus Stallion # Admiral Fairweather!
Others,"""Downdraft"": Colonel Purple Dart!"
Sassaflash,Admiral Fairy Flight!
Others,S04E21 Unnamed Pegasus Stallion # General Flash!
Others,"""High Note"": Commander Easyglider!"
Fluttershy,The history of the Wonderbolts!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! Thank you! Thank you all so much!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You're welcome, but it all came from you. You learned without knowing you're learning. Your main focus is flying, but then your brain is also absorbing lots of other information! It's actually really brilliant!"
Rainbow Dash,"Ha, I always knew I was brilliant!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash finally learned the history of the Wonderbolts, but she's not the only pony that needed a lesson; I needed to learn something just as important. One way of learning isn't better than another. After all, every pony is unique and individual."
Rainbow Dash,Yeeeaah! Whoo!
Pinkie Pie,[squeals] Yes! Best day ever! We're all going to the Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange! And not just going <U+0096> we're accompanying a princess on an official royal duty!
Twilight Sparkle,"Please, it's not that big of a deal. There always has to be a princess at the Exchange. Last year was Princess Cadance, this year it's me. It's just a formality. I'm sure none of the other ponies will even notice I'm here."
Crowd Pony 1,"Wow, look over there, a princess!"
Crowd Pony 2,"Oh, this is amazing!"
Applejack,"Could be wrong, but I think they might've noticed."
Fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness!"
Rarity,You said it. The Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange is simply divine. You can get anything you want here!
Applejack,If'n you got the goods to trade for it.
Spike,"[grunts] Wha? Nooo! Thanks, Twilight. Whew. One ding, nick or dent, and this Power Ponies comic book wouldn't be in perfect mint condition anymore. And if you want to trade for a mint comic, you gotta have a mint comic."
Applejack,I guess a pony who's here on official princess business has to expect a little fussin'.
Rainbow Dash,"There's a pony here who's got a signed first edition of Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue, and I'm gonna get it! I've been able to get first editions of all of the Daring Do books, except this one! Nopony's ever put together a whole set, and I'm gonna be the first! If it hasn't been traded yet... It's the only one in all of Equestria!"
Fluttershy,"Oh no! I'd really hate to see you disappointed. I did want to trade this bear call I've got for a bird whistle, but getting that book seems so important to you, so if you need me to help you first..."
Rainbow Dash,"Normally I'd say I don't need any help, but you're right. This is really important. I've gotta get that book!"
Applejack,"Well, I'm off to take a gander at some of the vintage stalls."
Rarity,"Did you say vintage? Why, old and rare items are so in style right now! I'm hoping to get a vintage item as well. I just hope I brought enough to trade."
Applejack,"I know what you mean, Rarity. Hey! Why don't we pool our trade stashes?"
Rarity,Pool?
Applejack,"That way, if one of us finds somethin' real valuable she can't live without..."
Rarity,"[gasps] She'll definitely be able to get it! Who could say no to exchanging a single object for such a huge assortment of items? Oh, yes! That is absolutely brilliant! I'm so glad I have a friend like you, Applejack."
Applejack,I feel the same way.
Rarity,Then let's go shopping!
Pinkie Pie,"Um, shouldn't your princessness be headed to the royal box seats?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I may be the princess on duty, but I don't think that means I have to sit up there all alone doing nothing. Ever since I became a princess, Celestia's been sending me more books to read than ever. The library's overflowing, so I figured while we're here, I might as well trade away some books I don't need anymore."
Pinkie Pie,Mm-hm!
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps] There it is! The first edition of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue! It hasn't been traded yet! [to stallholder] Lucky for you, because I've brought my most valuable possession to trade for it: My lucky horseshoe!"
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": I don't want it."
Rainbow Dash,What?!
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": It's just a rusty old horseshoe. That's not worth anything to me."
Fluttershy,"But, but how is Rainbow Dash going to get the book she really wants?"
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": Well, she's not."
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": Unless... she can get me that."
Fluttershy,"Aww, an Orthros! How cute!"
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": The pony running the ancient beasts stall doesn't want anything I've got. But if you can get me the Orthros, I'll trade you the book for it."
Rainbow Dash,"You got it! [to Fluttershy] I don't know how, but somehow, we're gonna get that Orthros."
Rarity,"Oh, Applejack, I am so glad I found you."
Applejack,Me too! You're not gonna believe it!
Applejack and Rarity,"[simultaneously] I found a super valuable vintage item I just have to have, and all it's gonna cost is all our stuff! [beat] Uh-oh."
Rarity,"So, where is this valuable vintage item you want to trade everything we have for?"
Applejack,There!
Rarity,Where?
Applejack,Right there!
Rarity,But... that's a dented old pie tin.
Applejack,A dented vintage pie tin. The metal they used to fashion this one helps cook the pies up to five seconds faster! They don't make 'em like this anymore!
Rarity,"I'm so glad you showed that to me, darling..."
Rarity,"...because once you see what I've found, you won't want to waste our trade goods on that. [giggles] Just look at this gorgeous vintage brooch. It's one of a kind!"
Applejack,It looks exactly like the one you're already wearin'.
Rarity,"Well, yes, they may look the same, but I know it's older, and that's what makes it so much more divine!"
Applejack,"But that doesn't make a lick of sense! Why, I'd wager if I switched them up, you wouldn't even know the difference!"
Rarity,"Oh, don't be silly, of course I would!"
Applejack,So which is the vintage one?
Rarity,"That one, of course."
Applejack,"Hah, you're bluffin'!"
Rarity,Am I? How can you tell?
Applejack,"Well... because... [groans] I can't, 'cause the one you wanna waste our whole stash on is exactly the same as the one you already got! There's no way anypony would notice the difference!"
Rarity,I'd say it's a lot more likely they'd notice that than some dented tin that cooked a pie a whole two seconds faster!
Applejack,It's five seconds faster!
Fluttershy,"Yes, such a good two-headed boy. Yes, you are!"
Cratus,"Stop that! C'mon, don't you start now, too!"
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, I can see you're busy, so I'll give it to you straight. I need to trade this horseshoe for... that."
Cratus,Nope.
Rainbow Dash,Aww.
Cratus,"Down, boy! Watch out for the lamp!"
Cratus,"Well, I could use another lamp."
Rainbow Dash,A whole stand filled with Discord-shaped lamps? Seriously?!
Fluttershy,They really do have everything at the Traders Exchange.
Rainbow Dash,Will you trade a lamp for my horseshoe so I can trade it for an Orthros and get my book?
Stellar Eclipse,No. But I'd trade it for an antique chicken.
Rainbow Dash,Great! [beat] What's an antique chicken?
Others,"""Match Game"": Oh, I got all kinds of antique chicken statues. I got your blue hens, speckled grays, your-"
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, cool! So will you trade one for a horseshoe so I can trade it for a lamp and then trade it for an Orthros so I can get my book?"
Others,"""Match Game"": Well, lemme think... Uh, no."
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,Aww.
Others,"""Match Game"": But I'd gladly trade one of my chickens for a crystal chalice."
Rainbow Dash,[panting] Hold on a sec. [inhales] We need a crystal chalice to trade for a chicken to trade for a lamp to trade for an Orthros. So what are you willing to trade for it? I'm guessing it's gotta be some crazy thing way across the Exchange.
Others,"""Amethyst Gleam"": Actually, I could use a slightly rusty old horseshoe."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, like where am I gonna find<U+0096> wait, I've got one of those! Now that we've got the chalice, this is gonna be a cinch!"
Fluttershy,Do you really think so?
Rainbow Dash,All we gotta do is bring this thing to the chicken stand and we are<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,"You want me to trade all my books for a broken pen? Alright, fine. You got yourself a<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,Stop! What are you doing?!
Twilight Sparkle,I was trying to get rid of all the books I don't need anymore.
Pinkie Pie,For that? Do you reaaaaally want that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, not really, but I'm running out of library space, so<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"Ohmygosh, ohmygosh, ohmygosh! I can't believe that almost happened! But luckily, it didn't happen, thanks to me."
Twilight Sparkle,What are you talking about?
Twilight Sparkle,"Y'know, if you want to go check out the rest of the Exchange and trade whatever you brought..."
Pinkie Pie,"Nope, I just came to pony-watch! I'm not going anywhere. I won't let you make a mistake like that again! Hey, everypony, step right up! Do not walk! Gallop over here for your chance to trade for authentic, one-of-a-kind, official princess merchandise!"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, that took forever."
Fluttershy,I just hope it looks okay.
Others,"""Match Game"": This is perfect!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh no! The pony we're supposed to trade the chicken statue to didn't tell us what kind he wanted! Okay, look. I'm fast. I'll fly over to the lamp stand and find out what kind of chicken he wants. Just don't let anypony trade for any chicken while I'm gone, okay?"
Fluttershy,"Um, well, okay! Um, I can do that, I think. [to Crusoe Palm] Um, well, maybe you shouldn't get one of those? You know... unless you really want to..."
Rainbow Dash,[groans] Beat it! You go. I'll stay here.
Rarity,"Well, since we can't both get what we want, I will be the better friend. You take our trade goods and get what you want."
Applejack,"I'm an amazin' friend! So even though it's for somethin' that don't seem valuable at all, you take our stash."
Rarity,How dare you let me get what I want. What kind of friend do you think I am? You are going to get what you want!
Applejack,"No, you are!"
Rarity,"No, you are!"
Pinkie Pie,"These books made Twilight the princess she is. Before that, she was nothing <U+0096> a big, fat zero!"
Twilight Sparkle,Hey!
Pinkie Pie,"Then she read these books, and voila! Princess! So who wants to start the bidding?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, just a moment, please! Pinkie, I appreciate your help and all, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this. Nopony should trade for my books just because I'm a princess. I'm not better than anypony else!"
Pinkie Pie,"[hushed] I know you're not better than everypony! Just leave this to me! [to crowd, normal] Did I mention that Princess Twilight got these books from Princess Celestia?"
Fleur De Verre,"Whoa, wait, you don't mean<U+0096>"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, that's right! Double princess!"
Fluttershy,There he is!
Rainbow Dash,"Look, I know it's your break and all, but you've gotta open your stand so we can trade you for a lamp!"
Stellar Eclipse,"[stomach rumbles] Sorry, girls. Been trading all day. My belly's tellin' me it's time to eat an oatburger."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh come on, please?"
Fluttershy,Pretty pretty please?
Stellar Eclipse,"Sorry, belly says 'no'."
Rainbow Dash,But the Exchange ends at sundown!
Stellar Eclipse,No!
Rainbow Dash,I've got an idea. Next! Next! Next! Next! Next!
Rainbow Dash,We're home free!
Rainbow Dash,As long as this thing doesn't drown us in slobber.
Fluttershy,"Oh, he's just an affectionate little two-headed fellow. Aren't you, little boy?"
Applejack,"No, I insist. You go fetch what you want, 'cause that's the kind of tried and true friend I am."
Rarity,Well! I am way too generous to let you out-friend me like that!
Rainbow Dash,We gotta hurry! [gasps] We're never gonna get to the Daring Do stand through this crowd in time!
Rainbow Dash,Come on!
Fluttershy,My bear call!
Rainbow Dash,We gotta go!
Fluttershy,Of course. It's just a bear call. There's nothing I could have traded it for that's more valuable to me than you.
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Okay, the Exchange is almost over, but we did it. We traded a crystal chalice for an antique chicken..."
Fluttershy,And the chicken for a lamp...
Rainbow Dash,"And the lamp for an Orthros, just like you asked."
Rainbow Dash,So there you go! Now where's my book?
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": Yeah, you know, the thing is... I don't really want an Orthros anymore."
Fluttershy,But... what do we do now?
Fluttershy,"Oh goodness, oh goodness!"
Rainbow Dash,Argh! Ugh...
Fluttershy,Good boy!
Rainbow Dash,Hey! You said you wanted an Orthros!
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": I've been watching that thing over at the ancient beast booth! It's crazy! I don't want one in my house!"
Fluttershy,"There, there, that's a good Orthros. You just have to know how to train them. With a little patient training and a big slobber mop, they can be a wonderful household pet."
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": [laughing] All right, all right. I'll trade you."
Rainbow Dash,Yes!
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": If she comes and stays with us in Manehattan until it's trained!"
Fluttershy,"Gosh, training an Orthros takes a long time. I'll probably be gone from Ponyville for... I don't even know how many moons! But... if that is what you really want..."
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": So we got a fair deal?"
Rainbow Dash,"Of course it's a deal! Yeah-eah, whoo! [squeals] I did it, I did it! Fluttershy, can you believe it? Oh no. what did I do?!"
Pinkie Pie,"Who's got something valuable enough to trade for Princess Twilight's princess books that she got from Princess Celestia? Did I say ""princess""?"
Minuette,"Over here, over here!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, come on! These are the books the princess would sit up with all night, with nothing to read by but the light of her own horn! Ooh, now that looks fun<U+0096> but not fun enough! These are the books that made Twilight the princess she is! So who's got what it takes to trade for them?"
Crowd Pony 3,"Well, when you put it like that..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, yes, they are."
Pinkie Pie,But I thought you wanted to get rid of them!
Twilight Sparkle,"None of those ponies had anything valuable enough to trade for my books. Not because these books belong to a princess, but because they helped make me who I am. Just like you said. This was the one I was so absorbed in the day Spike decided he owed Applejack a life debt. And this one reminds me of the day I got it <U+0096> which was the day I met you. I may not ever need to read these again, but that doesn't mean they don't have value. I realize that now, thanks to you, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,I told you I'd take care of everything!
Rainbow Dash,Twilight! I need you to say a trade wasn't fair! Fast!
Twilight Sparkle,"I've heard what you both have to say, and I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, but my hooves are tied. You said it was a fair trade."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I said it, but I was wrong! I did want that book, a lot. I said I wanted it more than anything in all of Equestria. But there's no thing that's worth as much to me as a friend. I might have forgotten that for a little bit, but it's true. Which means there's no way this trade can be fair!"
Others,"""Teddie Safari"": Oh, come on, that's... the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Okay, the trade's off!"
Pinkie Pie,[in distance] Woo-hoo!
Rarity,"I know it's not the pie tin you were after, but I hope you like it. It's the rustiest piece of junk I could get."
Applejack,"Well, I took my half of our stash and got you this!"
Rarity,Ohhh!
Applejack,"And I know you're gonna love it, 'cause you already have a bunch of ones that look exactly the same sittin' in the drawer doin' nothin'. So that should settle it once and for all which of us is the better friend."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, come on! You both gave up what you wanted to get something for each other! That's the coolest thing a friend can do. Trust me, I know."
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, where's your double-doggie?"
Rainbow Dash,I traded it for something way better.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, what do you know? My copy of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue. It's just a beat up old paperback, not a one-of-a-kind first edition..."
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps] Even better, because I can read this one with all my friends!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hear ye, hear ye! The Ponyville Foal and Filly Fair is almost ready to begin!"
Rarity,"Just because the attendees are young, doesn't mean they don't deserve my very best creative work. Why, this puppet theater is going to be the talk of the Foal and Filly Fair!"
Spike,How could it not be? [dreamily] You're the one making it...
Rarity,Oh! But I couldn't have done it without the help of one of my dearest and most supportive friends! You are my favorite dragon.
Spike,"Your favorite dragon? Aw, gee..."
Rarity,"The hours have been long, the work taxing beyond compare, but it will all be worth it when we hear those three little words!"
Claude,This is awful!
Rarity,Awful?!
Claude,"And completely unusable. Hmmm... Ugh! It doesn't travel! Oh, there's no room for my puppets! It appears I won't have a traveling puppet theater to use after all."
Spike,I don't know what that guy was talking about. This thing is perfect!
Spike,So that puppeteer didn't like your exquisitely crafted best puppet theater in the history of puppet theaters puppet theater. [beat] You can just contribute something else to the Foal and Filly Fair.
Spike,"Argh, there's gotta be something in here somewhere."
Spike,"It's not ""who"", it's ""what""! Like, what can help Rarity make something in time for the fair? She really, really, really wants to make a creative contribution. She said I'm her favorite dragon, so it's up to me to come through for her in her time of need. There's gotta be some kind of spell that'll do the trick."
Spike,"Come on, help a dragon out!"
Spike,Ugh! It's not for me! It's for Rarity! The one who made you that bow tie you like so much?
Spike,"Okay, I get it."
Spike,You don't think we should use magic<U+0096> What is that?
Spike,"What? If I wasn't supposed to have it, it wouldn't be so easy to get. And it's covered in spikes, like me."
Spike,"""Inspiration Manifestation: Instantly brings ideas to life."""
Spike,I'm likin' the looks of this one. Hmmm.
Spike,Rarity!
Rarity,"Leave me be! Can't you see how distraught, disappointed, and downtrodden I still am?"
Spike,But I brought you something.
Rarity,"Unless it's another carton of vanilla oat swirl or word that the festival has been cancelled, I don't think I'm interested."
Spike,It's magic!
Rarity,"Spike, precious scales, I already have magic."
Spike,But not the kind that can help you create something in time for the fair. This can!
Rarity,"I suppose it's worth a try. ""From in the head to out in the world, every thought to action. Hold close this book and through its spell, you'll start a chain reaction. Projecting forth whatever beauty you see. Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free."""
Spike,Did it work?
Rarity,"Hm, there's only one way to find out."
Rarity,"[gasps] Oh, my! I thought about making this a much more beautiful spell book, and I have!"
Rarity,"Dear, dear Spike! Here I was about to give up, but like a true friend, you've come through with flying colors! Come! We must find the puppeteer right away, so that I may provide him with the most fabulous theater he's ever imagined! Or, should I say, that I've ever imagined."
Claude,"Ah, Miss Rarity, come to see the show, I presume? You'll notice I had to make do in light of your recent failure to produce a functioning theater."
Rarity,"Oh, but I think you'll find the new one I've created will be much more to your liking!"
Claude,"[mumbling] Ah, well, it is gorgeous, but that was never the problem now, was it? Oh, well, this one does seem to travel. Plenty of room for my puppets... I say, Miss Rarity, I don't know how you managed to do so in such a short amount of time, but you seem to have redeemed yourself. How did you manage to do so in such a short time?"
Spike,"As a matter of fact, she used a s<U+0096>"
Rarity,A good designer never reveals her tricks.
Rarity,"Thank you again, Spike, for being such a dear friend and finding this book for me!"
Spike,"My pleasure. Well, guess I can return it now that the fair's over."
Rarity,"Oh, yes, of course. I've made my creative contribution as I'd hoped to do, and all is well! Uh, then again, perhaps I should keep it just a skotch longer... You don't mind, do you, Spike?"
Spike,"Of course not! See you tomorrow! [to Owlowiscious] What? She'll keep it for a few more hours, no harm in that."
Spike,Rarity?
Spike,Whoa!
Rarity,"Spike, I'm so glad you're here!"
Spike,Whoa! Are... you okay?
Rarity,"Oh, I've never been better! This book you've given me is amazing! Why, I, I, I, I've been up all night just creating and creating and creating and creating! I've completed my fall line for the next fifteen seasons!"
Spike,Wow!
Rarity,"But then I started thinking, 'why stop there'? Oh, Spike, I've always thought this town of ours could use a few beautifying upgrades, and with this book, I can make that happen with such ease! You will support me in this endeavor by letting me keep the book just a little longer?"
Spike,Of course I will!
Spike,[panting] What do you say we get a little breakfast before we get started?
Rarity,No time for breakfast! I want to get started right away!
Spike,"Technically, we do have time, because with that book held close, you can just make things<U+0096> Rarity?"
Rarity,"Now, this is exactly what I'm talking about! Why, that cart hasn't an ounce of stylish flair!"
Granny Smith,My eyes playin' tricks on me again?
Applejack,What in rhubarb pie just happened?
Rarity,Isn't it gorgeous?
Spike,It's amazing! You should ask Applejack if she wants you to give all the Apple family carts a makeover!
Rarity,"Oh, I don't really think I need to ask permission, darling. Everyone loves surprises, especially when they're gorgeous ones!"
Spike,You're right! Everypony does love surprises.
Rarity,[hushed] We shouldn't even tell anypony that it's me who's behind all the fabulous changes I'll be making! [giggles] Won't that be a fun little secret for the three of us to share?
Spike,The... three of us?
Rarity,"You, me, and the book, of course. My marvelous, marvelous book!"
Spike,...Of course.
Rarity,Promise me you won't say a word to anypony?
Spike,[muffled] You got it!
Rarity,"I knew I could count on you, Spike. And I also know just what I want to do next!"
Rarity,"I've always thought Rainbow Dash could use a little more glamor, and now look at her! Cloud-busting with style! [short laugh] Moving on!"
Spike,"She'll be fine. It's just a dress. Uh, wait for your favorite dragon!"
Fluttershy,"La la-la la-la la-la la la... There you go, Mr. Robin!"
Fluttershy,Don't you look so content in your little house<U+0096>
Fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, my goodness!"
Fluttershy,"You're lost? No, not that way, that looks like it's the door to a... bedroom. Try that one over there. No, no, that leads to a..."
Fluttershy,"Shoe closet? Oh, dear. Maybe try the staircase? Oh, no-no-no, the other staircase."
Rarity,Isn't it gorgeous?
Spike,It's probably the most beautiful birdhouse ever created.
Rarity,Go on.
Spike,I'm just not sure how the bird feels about it.
Rarity,"Pfft, what does a bird know about architectural design? What matters is what you think, Spike. And you love it. Don't you?"
Spike,Of course I do. It's so... [beat] Rarity.
Rarity,"It is, isn't it? Ooh!"
Rarity,"Oh, adorable! But it could use a touch of class, don't you think?"
Spike,"Oh yeah, definitely."
Rarity,"This party doesn't even seem to have a proper theme. Let's do something about that, shall we?"
Spike,You've already made things look really really great. Maybe you should stop while you're ahead?
Rarity,"You're right, Spike! There's so much to do elsewhere!"
Spike,Right! Elsewhere...
Rarity,Just one more little thing before we go...
Rarity,"Why, this party is certain to make the society page now. Won't Pinkie Pie be pleased?"
Pinkie Pie,"Happy, happy day to<U+0096> huh?!"
Rarity,I am simply buzzing with ideas. Simply buzzing!
Spike,"That's great! But, uh, you've been at this for a while now. How 'bout you take a break? Give that brilliant mind of yours a rest?"
Rarity,"Don't be silly! I'm not going to stop now! Why, I won't stop until every inch of Ponyville has benefited from my creative vision! Starting with you, Spike!"
Rarity,You look fabulous!
Spike,"All because of you, heh..."
Rarity,"Anything for my favorite dragon and most supportive friend. Come, there's so much more to do!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Oh no, not you too!"
Spike,"What do you mean, not me too?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh. Judging by that outfit, I thought for sure you'd<U+0096>"
Spike,What? This? I just wanted to try out a new look.
Spike,You like?
Twilight Sparkle,"Hmm... Well, in that case, have you seen anypony suspicious around?"
Spike,"Uh, nope."
Mayor Mare,"Princess Twilight, the gazebo has been turned into solid crystal, and two ponies are now trapped inside its walls!"
Spike,No! I made a promise to Rarity to keep this to myself!
Spike,"[sighs] But you're right, Owlowiscious. I have to tell. And once I do, I can forget Rarity thinking of me as her most supportive friend... I can forget Rarity thinking of me as a friend at all..."
Spike,[sighs] I can't do it. I promised I'd keep all of this between the three of us!
Spike,"Of course it's weird she meant her, me and the spell book. But<U+0096> The spellbook! Of course! If I can get it away from her, I bet she won't be able to use its magic anymore! Oh, come on, it's the perfect plan! I... just have to figure out which way she went."
Stallion,I can't see!
Spike,I'm thinking she's headed this way.
Rarity,[giggling] What do you think you're doing?!
Spike,"Uh, me? I was just, uh... basking in your creative radiance."
Rarity,"Oh, Spike, you do say the nicest things."
Spike,Thanks.
Rarity,"Now, where was I? Oh yes! Gold-plated rooftops for everypony!"
Rarity,Spike!
Rarity,I have just had the most marvelous idea!
Spike,[gulps] [gasps] Of course you have. You're Rarity.
Rarity,My work here in Ponyville is nearly complete. Don't you think it's time the rest of Equestria benefited from my creative vision?
Spike,Absolutely!
Spike,"Oh, yeah, we should definitely go by<U+0096>"
Spike,Huh?! How... how did you... do that?
Rarity,"Why, whatever do you mean?"
Spike,The book! It's<U+0096> I mean<U+0096> you don't<U+0096> it's gone! The book is gone!
Spike,Why would I do anything with your book? We're friends! It... it was probably the owl!
Rarity,"But, wait... I don't seem to need it anymore, do I? Yes... yes...! I can feel its magic flowing within me now! I'm so excited! I'm so excited!"
Spike,[quietly] I'm so scared.
Rarity,"Oh, the places we'll go, Spike! Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Canterlot! And there you'll be by my side, just as you've always been here in Ponyville, your constant praise and adoration driving me to even greater heights, until there isn't an inch of Equestria that hasn't been utterly transformed by my creative genius!"
Spike,...No.
Rarity,What did you say?
Spike,"I said 'no'. You've been changing things, but you haven't been making them better. I should have told you the truth at the very beginning, but I didn't because I was trying to be a supportive friend. [sighs] But instead, I let you become something awful."
Rarity,Awful?
Rarity,Ugh... what happened?
Spike,Rarity! You're okay?
Rarity,"I... I think so... though by the looks of it, something quite terrifying has happened to Ponyville."
Spike,You happened.
Rarity,Me?
Spike,The last part of the spell!
Rarity,[flashback] Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free.
Spike,"The spell took over you, and you wanted to change everything in Equestria. I was afraid to tell you how I really felt about it, but then I... I told you the truth."
Rarity,"Dearest Spike, you should never be afraid to tell me the truth. We're friends, remember?"
Spike,Today I learned how important it is to be honest with your friends when they're doing something that you don't think is right. A true friend knows that you're speaking up because you care about them.
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike. Never, ever, ever, ever take another book out of the library at the castle without asking! Princess Cadance and Princess Luna have much better things to do than help me clean up Ponyville! Do you have any idea how hard it was to reverse that much dark magic?!"
Spike,[chuckles] You don't look so good.
Spike,What? I'm just being honest! It's what good friends do!
Rainbow Dash,This just got real!
Rainbow Dash,"Listen up, gang! We're almost there, so I've got a few things to say. First off, who here besides me thinks this is the best Equestria Games delegation in Ponyville history?"
Bulk Biceps,Yeah!
Rainbow Dash,"And no matter what your sport is, we gotta give it our best, because we've all got a genuine shot at Ponyville gold!"
Rainbow Dash,"...With the possible exception of Bulk Biceps, Fluttershy, and me. I mean, we're good and all, but we're up against the Wonderbolts in the aerial relay, so gold's kind of a stretch. Let's not kid ourselves."
Scootaloo,"Don't feel bad, Rainbow Dash! We have absolutely no shot at getting gold either!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, that's because you're carrying the flag for Ponyville in the opening ceremony. There are no winners."
Scootaloo,"Winners or not, we still have the chance to be awesome!"
Rainbow Dash,"That's the spirit! You hear that, everypony? Winners or not, we all still have the chance to be awesome!"
Rainbow Dash,"But, uh, let's still try to win lots and lots of stuff too, 'kay?"
Spike,"[straining] It's all in there, gang! Leave it to Spike, champion gear-carrier for all your gear-carrying needs."
Apple Bloom,And the Ponyville flag? You sure? And what about the flagpole?
Spike,In with the portable ramp! Whoa!
Scootaloo,"Give it a rest, Apple Bloom."
Spike,"Aw, she's just nervous, that's all. Perfectly understandable. Whenever I'm afraid I'll forget something or start to panic, I have a simple trick. I count to ten, and by the time I'm done, I've calmed myself enough to get the job done right every time. Easy-peasy, cider-squeezy!"
Spike,Hey! Put me down!
Scootaloo,What's going on?!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Are you all right?
Crystal Guard,"A thousand pardons, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious."
Spike,Huh? Who the what now?
Princess Cadance,"[to guards] Thanks for bringing Spike to us. [to Spike] It's okay, Spike. We'll have our hoofponies go back for your bags."
Spike,"Uh, can they hang back a second and tell me what's going on first?"
Spike,"[eating] Mm! So the ponies here think I'm some kind of hero, huh? [to Fleur De Verre] More of the green ones, please? I like the green ones."
Twilight Sparkle,"Last time you were here, you got the Crystal Heart to Princess Cadance in time to save this entire empire from destruction!"
Princess Cadance,"You are known throughout my empire as ""Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious""."
Twilight Sparkle,"Isn't that awesome? You're a big shot here, Spike! See that? That's you!"
Spike,"[a la Barbra Streisand] Hello, gawgeous!"
Princess Cadance,This is why we all hope you do us the honor of lighting the torch at the opening ceremony. You'd be the very first dragon in the history of the Equestria Games to do so.
Shining Armor,"Places for the procession, everypony! Two minutes!"
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. And you're quite certain you also understand exactly what you're supposed to do?
Spike,"I stand where you tell me until you give me the signal, and then I walk over and light the torch."
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. Mm. Couldn't be simpler.
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Mr. the Dragon, are you coming? [to herself] Honestly. [out loud] Would somepony help him walk?"
Shining Armor,"Now, please welcome the delegation from Ponyville!"
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Ponyville forever! Yay!
Rainbow Dash,Awesome!
Fluttershy,Yay.
Bulk Biceps,Yeah!
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. [stomps hoof] This is the signal! [stomps hoof] I'm giving you the signal now! Mr. the Dragon!
Spike,"[inhales] [coughing] Come on, Spike! Calm yourself! Count to ten. One... two... three... thousand... fourteen thousand... Twenty thousand...! Thirty thousand...!"
Princess Cadance,What's wrong?
Spike,[inhales] [weak breath] Tell me this isn't happening...
Twilight Sparkle,"Equestria, we have a problem."
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. Mr. the Dragon! Would you light the torch already?!
Spike,"I don't know what it is, but I just don't have the stuff today! Did you bring a match?"
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. You're a fire-breathing dragon.
Spike,"[coughs] [raspy] Then some cough drops, maybe?"
Princess Cadance,Somepony go down and help him!
Twilight Sparkle,Phew!
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. Oh! How did you do that?
Spike,I'm... not sure.
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Oh, well. Better late than never."
Shining Armor,Let the games begin!
Rarity,Oh! There are our little superstars! You were fabulous!
Applejack,Made me sit up proud like a cornstalk in August!
Rainbow Dash,"Ya done good, squirt!"
Twilight Sparkle,You three really were wonderful. But does anypony know what was going on with Spike?
Applejack,He sure seemed to be having a tough time of it out there.
Rarity,"He put things right in time, though."
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, it was me. I didn't want him to be embarrassed, so I cast a secret spell to light it for him."
Rarity,"Oh, dear. Have you told him?"
Twilight Sparkle,"No, but he might have figured it out on his own."
Applejack,"You gotta tell him, just in case."
Twilight Sparkle,I know. I'm just afraid of how he'll take it. I know what pride he takes in a job well done.
Rainbow Dash,"Psst, here he comes now! Act casual! [to Spike] 'Sup?"
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Is everything okay?
Spike,I guess. I don't know. The weirdest thing happened down there.
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, about that. I<U+0096>"
Spike,"I mean, there I was, trying to light the torch, with all of Equestria watching, and feeling like the hugest failure ever, and then the thing just lit! It was amazing!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, phew! I was afraid you'd be upset."
Spike,Upset? Are you kidding? Why would I be upset to discover I can light fire... with my mind?
Others,"Applejack, Rainbow Dash, What?!"
Bright Smile,"Look, look, it's the Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious!"
Elbow Grease,Can we get your autograph?
Spike,Sure!
Bright Smile,How you saved our Empire last time you were here was really amazing!
Twilight Sparkle,"[whispering] Spike, may I have a word with you a moment?"
Spike,"Hey, you'd better be careful with that! It might burst into flames later! Delayed reaction. Hey, Twi, what is it? Hold on, hold on, give me a second... If I can set fire to stuff with my mind, mind-reading must be just around the corner! And I predict that you are about to ask me... to set fire to something with my mind!"
Twilight Sparkle,"No, because you can't!"
Spike,"Oh, really? So how do you explain what happened down there in front of thousands and thousands of<U+0096>"
Twilight Sparkle,"I did it, Spike. I cast a spell to do it for you."
Spike,In front of... thousands and... thousands...?
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Spike. I just couldn't stand to see you stuck like that! You understand, don't you?"
Spike,I... I... I need to be alone right now.
Twilight Sparkle,Spike?
Others,"""Neighls Bohr"": O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious, can I get your autograph?"
Spike,Sorry. You should probably ask somebody special instead.
Shining Armor,"Our next event... [amplified, some distance away] ...the aerial relay!"
Applejack,That's Dash and Fluttershy!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, no! We can't be late for that!"
Security Guard,"Miss? Step right over here. Unicorns will no longer be admitted without a disabling spell, to prevent cheating. And make sure you don't even try casting a spell, or we'll know it."
Rarity,Hmph!
Pinkie Pie,"[chewing] [swallows] If Ponyville medals here, we'll have eight medals so far, putting us tied for the lead with Cloudsdale! Unless Cloudsdale medals here too...!"
Spike,"Ms. Harshwhinny? I know you're really busy, but..."
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. What is it?
Spike,"Maybe there's something else I can do for the Games. Y'know, something really worthy of the Crystal Empire's admiration?"
Ms. Harshwhinny,Ms. What are you talking about? You lit the torch for the whole thing!
Spike,"Uh, well, actually, that wasn't really<U+0096>"
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. That wasn't worthy enough for you? Ugh, for pony's sake! Next thing you know, you'll be asking to put on a rock concert. [snorts] [to herself] Celebrities..."
Spike,"Wait, that's it!"
Applejack,We got silver!
Shining Armor,"Congratulations to all our medalists. And now, the anthem of<U+0096>"
Spike,And I shall do the honor of singing!
Shining Armor,"[to Spike, hushed] Spike, what are you doing?!"
Spike,"You know how they always just play the music? [amplified] Well, I know all the words to our anthem, and will sing them for you now, loud and proud, to the enjoyment of all!"
Shining Armor,"And now... um... the Cloudsdale anthem, as sung by... Spike!"
Spike,Wait! The Cloudsdale anthem?
Shining Armor,"[hushed] They only play the anthem for the winner, Spike! The Wonderbolts are from Cloudsdale!"
Spike,But... But I don't know the words to the Cloudsdale anthem! I've never even heard it!
Crystal Pony in Crowd,"Sing for us, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious!"
Spike,"[clears throat] [singing out of time and rhythm] Oh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast And we're from Cloudsdale which-is-a-part-of-Equestria<U+00A0> [laughs nervously] That we like best and we're proud and we're fast and we like it because it really has nice trees Yeah, we love the town because it's so cool and, and we like to fly really fast and everything like that [sighs] I kinda wish this was over 'cause it is... n't... yet... over... now."
Others,"Oh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast and we're cloud<U+0096> from Cloudsdale We like it there 'cause it's really nice and the trees are cool and I hope it is over now And... it keeps going on, la la la And we really love the town So I wish that this... song... was over now. Over... now. Over... now."
Pinkie Pie,Nailed it!
Apple Bloom,"Spike, you comin'?"
Spike,"Nah, I got this stuff to pack up."
Scootaloo,But you've been moping in here for almost the entire Games.
Sweetie Belle,And tonight's the closing ceremony!
Spike,"Which means we leave tomorrow. Ergo, the packing."
Shining Armor,"And so the Games conclude as they always do, with the ice archery finals! Ice archers, take your places!"
Applejack,Too bad Ponyville doesn't have any ice archers competin'. We don't have anyone to root for.
Pinkie Pie,"That's okay. Ponyville has thirty seven medals, and Cloudsdale thirty six, so looks like we'll be medal champs of the Games anyway! Woo-hoo!"
Rainbow Dash,"But Cloudsdale has two ice archery finalists down there now! If they both place, Cloudsale wins the medal count!"
Pinkie Pie,So you're saying that it all comes down to this one event?!
Applejack,Pretty much.
Pinkie Pie,Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh! Twilight! Come take this extra seat next to me and freak out over the medal count! I'll show you how: Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, I was looking for Spike. Have you seen him?"
Apple Bloom,He wouldn't come.
Sweetie Belle,We tried to talk him into it...
Scootaloo,...but he wouldn't listen!
Pinkie Pie,"You can have his extra seat, though. Uh... Twi?"
Twilight Sparkle,Spike?
Twilight Sparkle,You here?
Spike,"[chokes] Uh, yeah! I'm super-busy! Look at all this packing left to do, heh. Crazy, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,No more hiding out. You're coming with me. Now.
Spike,"Okay, fine. I'll come. Can I at least wear these?"
Rainbow Dash,Those aren't your average arrows. They freeze whatever part of the target they hit. Whoever encases their entire target in ice first wins. Keep your eye on number seven from Cloudsdale <U+0096> he's the favorite.
Twilight Sparkle,"Honestly, Spike, I don't see why you're being so hard on yourself."
Spike,"I let everypony down. Twice. You never let anypony down, so you don't have any idea what that's like."
Twilight Sparkle,"Are you kidding? I've totally let ponies down. That's not the point. The torch got lit, the aerial relay teams got their medals -- no harm, no foul."
Spike,Can we at least watch from inside there? I'm not sure I'm ready to face crowds in the stands just yet.
Shining Armor,No!
Rainbow Dash,"Steer it towards the field, away from the crowds!"
Shining Armor,Somepony cut the disabling spell!
Security Guard 2,There isn't time!
Spike,"Dash, Fluttershy! Move!"
Rainbow Dash,That was awesome!
Princess Cadance,"I just wanted to thank you personally for saving those ponies and the Games, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious. You must be very proud."
Spike,I guess.
All present characters bar Spike,You guess?!
Spike,"I just saw what needed to be done and reacted. Just so happens I can breathe fire and... if any of you could do that, you'd have done the same."
Applejack,"Forgive me for bein' blunt, Spike, but you're not makin' a lick of sense."
Spike,"Well, it's just how I feel."
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait a second. I think I get it. You keep saying you let everypony down, but we all keep saying you didn't. You know who's disappointed in you, Spike? You. And only you can make it right with you again. What would that take, Spike?"
Spike,"Meh, I don't know. Can you turn back time? 'Cause I'd sure like a do-over on that opening ceremony."
Princess Cadance,"We can't turn back time, but, would you do me the great honor of lighting fireworks in my place at the closing ceremonies tonight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, Spike. You saved the Crystal Empire twice! I think you can light some fireworks."
Spike,"Mm, I guess I have to at least give it a shot."
Pinkie Pie,"We did it! Ponyville won the medal count, and only by one medal!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hmm, wonder which medal that was? Bam!"
Applejack,"How does it feel to have opened the best Equestria Games in Ponyville history, squirt?"
Apple Bloom,Probably as good as it feels to close them!
Ms. Harshwhinny,"Ms. Okay, it's time!"
Spike,"You know, it's kinda weird. No matter how many times others tell you you're great, all the praise in the world means nothing if you don't feel it inside. [inhales] [breathes fire] Sometimes to feel good about yourself, you gotta let go of the past. That way, when the time comes to let your greatness fly, you'll be able to light up the whole sky."
Spike,"Seems like only yesterday I was saving this place from being totally destroyed. Hey, you guys remember that?"
Rainbow Dash,You only mentioned it about fifteen times on the train here.
Rarity,"[sarcastically, to Rainbow Dash] Yes, and we never hear a peep out of you about your exploits."
Rainbow Dash,"Heh, point taken."
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm glad you all wanted to come, but I don't think it's gonna be that exciting. I pretty much just have to smile and wave as the dignitaries arrive."
Rarity,"Yes, but you get to smile and wave like a princess."
Applejack,How exactly is that different than smilin' and wavin' like not a princess?
Twilight Sparkle,It isn't.
Fluttershy,"What's wrong, Twilight?"
Pinkie Pie,Why the looooooooong face?
Twilight Sparkle,I've just been feeling a little unsure about things lately. It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.
Applejack,That's just silly. You've got a real important role in Equestria.
Fluttershy,Princess Celestia wouldn't have asked you to come today if she didn't think so.
Twilight Sparkle,I guess you're right.
Rarity,Of course we are. Now hurry along! You don't want to risk having that important role diminished because you were tardy for your regal meet-and-greet.
Flash Sentry,The Duke and Duchess of Maretonia!
Duke of Maretonia,Your highness. Thank you for understanding our desire to keep the number of those privy to these confidential discussions to a minimum.
Twilight Sparkle,Of course.
Twilight Sparkle,Is there anything else I can do to assist with their visit?
Princess Cadance,"I'm sorry, Twilight, but their visit is already over."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh.
Princess Luna,Something wrong?
Twilight Sparkle,I guess I just don't really understand why I'm here. Couldn't one of the royal guard have unfurled the banner?
Princess Celestia,Having all four of us in the Empire to greet them lets the dignitaries know that their visit is considered an important one.
Princess Cadance,"Plus, it gives me an opportunity to see my favorite sister-in-law."
Twilight Sparkle,And I'm happy to see you. All of you.
Princess Cadance,But...?
Twilight Sparkle,"But I... well, it's just that Princess Luna raises the moon, Princess Celestia raises the sun, you protect the Crystal Empire, and all I seem to do is... smile and wave."
Twilight Sparkle,"It isn't that I'm ungrateful For all the things that I've earned, For all the journeys I have taken, All the lessons that I have learned"
Others,"But I wonder where I'm going now, What my role is meant to be I don't know how to travel To a future that I can't see"
Others,"I have my wings, I wear this crown I'm a princess, this is true But it's still unclear to me Just what I am meant to do"
Others,I wanna<U+00A0>have a purpose Wanna do all that I can I wanna make a contribution I want to be a part of the plan
Princess Celestia,Your destiny's uncertain And that's sometimes hard to take But it will become much clearer With every new choice you make
Princess Luna,Patience is never easy I understand wanting more I know how hard it is to wait To spread out your wings and soar
Princess Cadance,But you stand here for a reason You're gifted and you are strong That crown is upon your head because You belong
Others,"[Princesses Celestia, Luna, and Cadance] Know that your time is coming soon As the sun rises, so does the moon As love finds a place in every heart You are a princess; you'll play your part"
Princess Luna,"We understand you wanting more A chance to shine, a chance to soar"
Princess Cadance,Soon will come the day it turns around
Others,"[Princesses Celestia, Luna, and Cadance] Know that your time is coming soon As the sun rises, so does the moon As love finds a place in every heart You are a princess; you'll play your part"
Princess Celestia,You are a princess; you'll play your part
Princess Celestia,Your time will come.
Rare Find,Very sorry. [chuckles] You came out of nowhere.
Princess Luna,"Sister, are you alright?!"
Princess Celestia,I've just had the most terrible dream.
Princess Luna,"Why do you think I'm here? You know as well as I that this was not a dream, but a vision."
Princess Celestia,"Then we haven't much time. The stronger he becomes, the more we are all in danger."
Princess Celestia,"[narrating] Tirek and his brother Scorpan came here from a distant land, intent on stealing Equestrian magic. But Scorpan soon came to appreciate the ways of Equestria, even befriending a young unicorn wizard."
Princess Luna,"[narrating] Scorpan urged his brother to abandon their plans. When Tirek refused, Scorpan alerted us to Tirek's intentions."
Princess Celestia,"[narrating] Scorpan returned to his own land, and Tirek was sent to Tartarus for his crimes. But it appears he has found a way to escape."
Princess Luna,We believe it happened when Cerberus left his post at the gates.
Twilight Sparkle,But that was a long time ago. Why is he just now starting to steal magic?
Princess Celestia,His time in Tartarus left him very weak. He has just now gained enough strength to use his dark powers.
Princess Luna,"But with each passing moment, he grows stronger still."
Princess Cadance,And I know just the princess who can stop him.
Twilight Sparkle,Yes. I'll find him and<U+0096>
Princess Celestia,"No, Twilight. I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek. Discord."
Applejack,...As in Discord Discord?
Twilight Sparkle,Yes!
Fluttershy,I don't think it's that big of a surprise. He can be very helpful.
Twilight Sparkle,"He can sense when there's a magical imbalance. The next time Tirek steals magic, Discord will be able to track him down!"
Rainbow Dash,So what are you supposed to do in the meantime?
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Nothing. Unless of course one of you needs me to smile and wave.
Spike,Where are you going?
Twilight Sparkle,To the Castle of the Two Sisters. I'm not really needed anywhere else. Might as well catch up on some of my reading.
Rainbow Dash,You want some company?
Applejack,<U+00A0>It has been a while since we visited the castle. Might be fun!
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe I could use a little company right now.
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I still can't believe we had to give back the Elements.
Rarity,It had to be done or the Tree of Harmony wouldn't have survived.
Fluttershy,"But Twilight was right. Even without the Elements, our friendship is as strong as ever."
Applejack,I just hope another 'friend' of ours never makes us sorry we had to give them up.
Discord,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?"
Applejack,How'd you guess?
Discord,My ears were burning.
Rainbow Dash,"What are you even doing here, Discord?"
Discord,"Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my extremely important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee."
Spike,Big deal.
Discord,"You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess."
Discord,Mmwah! Mmwah!
Rainbow Dash,In your dreams!
Discord,"Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna."
Applejack,Don't you have a creepy magic-stealin' villain to track down?
Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much."
Pinkie Pie,Wait a minute! How do you know how she was feeling?!
Discord,"[mock sadness] Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?"
Discord,"[clears throat] Well in any case, I suppose now is as good a time as any for me to make my exit."
Applejack,And good riddance!
Discord,"Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy,I wouldn't miss it.
Discord,"[singsong] Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...!"
Applejack,Sometimes I think the 'reformed' Discord is more obnoxious than the 'before-he-was-reformed' Discord.
Rarity,Indeed.
Fluttershy,"But he could be right, couldn't he? What if there is something important in that chest?"
Twilight Sparkle,There's only one way to find out.
Twilight Sparkle,Anything?
Twilight Sparkle,There must be something in this library that can help me figure out how to open it. The answer's in one of these books. I just know it.
Discord,"Tirek, I presume?"
Lord Tirek,Discord. You're free?
Discord,As a bird.
Lord Tirek,I commend you on your escape.
Lord Tirek,"Oh, I should have known you would want to have Equestria all to yourself."
Lord Tirek,Fluttershy? You're not saying you're friends with ponies?
Discord,Surprise!
Lord Tirek,I am surprised that someone with your intellect does not see this 'friendship' is but a new form of imprisonment. Clearly you've had to abandon your true nature to stay in their good graces.
Discord,I have done nothing of the sort!
Lord Tirek,"Oh, please, I've seen this before. But he was always weak minded. You are Discord, you are legend, you cannot fall into the same trap that claimed my brother! Help me to grow strong, and be rewarded with something far greater than friendship. Freedom. Once I've stripped these ponies of their magic, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see their world turned upside down. Who better to do so than the master of chaos himself? Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness. Unless, of course, 'pony errand boy' is the role you've always wanted to play in this world."
Twilight Sparkle,"I think I found something! I've been reading our journal, and there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked. Applejack, do you remember when you had to tell everypony that the tonic Granny bought from the Flim Flam brothers didn't really work?"
Applejack,How could I forget? It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.
Applejack,"[flashback] I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!"
Applejack,"[present] And in that moment, I knew I had to be honest. I just knew it. But what's that got to do with openin' the chest?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I've found that each of you has had to face a situation where living up to the Element of Harmony you represent wasn't easy. Fluttershy, it was when you realized that the way to show kindness to the Breezies was by forcing them to leave your home."
Fluttershy,"Oh, the looks on their poor little faces! But I knew that, as difficult as it was, pushing them away was the kindest thing I could do."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, even after Suri took advantage of your generosity at Fashion Week in Manehattan, you didn't let it cause you to abandon your generous spirit."
Rarity,I simply couldn't have lived with myself if I didn't do something special for the friends who have always been so generous to me!
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, you had the chance to fly with the Wonderbolts at the Equestria Games, but instead you chose to compete with your friends."
Rainbow Dash,Sure! But being loyal to my friends was way<U+0096>
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, my turn, my turn!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you realized that seeing your friend laugh was more important than proving you were a better party planner than Cheese Sandwich."
Rainbow Dash,Best party I've ever had.
Rarity,"It's clear we've all had our moments to shine, Twilight, but I'm with Applejack. What does any of this have to do with the opening of the chest?"
Twilight Sparkle,"All of you had tough choices to make. But when you made the right one and embraced your element, it helped somepony else make the right choice too. Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change. I know it sounds crazy, but maybe there's something special about those objects that could lead us to the location of the keys. The chest is connected to the Tree of Harmony, the Tree is connected to the Elements, and the Elements are connected to all of us. There must be a connection! I hate to admit it, but maybe Discord was trying to be a good friend after all."
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't see anything on them that would give us a clue as to where the keys might be. They're just... ordinary, everyday objects."
Pinkie Pie,"Come on, Boneless! Give us that key!"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't think that's going to work.
Twilight Sparkle,There's still one key missing. The key that represents the element of magic. My element.
Fluttershy,"Oh, but I'm sure that if we've gotten our keys, you have too, Twilight."
Rarity,"Think, Twilight. When have you completed a difficult magical task, and in doing so encouraged another pony to do the same?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I haven't. If I had, I would have written about it in the journal."
Spike,What's it say?
Twilight Sparkle,That I'm needed in Canterlot at once!
Twilight Sparkle,I came as quickly as I could! Is something wrong? Is it Tirek?
Princess Celestia,I'm afraid I put too much trust in Discord and the effect that friendship would have upon him.
Princess Luna,Discord has betrayed the ponies of Equestria and joined forces with Tirek.
Twilight Sparkle,How could he do this?! I thought our friendship meant something to him! I thought he had changed.
Princess Celestia,"Tirek has stolen enough magic that he now has the strength to steal flight as well. Without Pegasi to control the weather, there will be no rain in Equestria. There is word he has gone after Earth ponies as well. Without their strength, they will not be able to tend the land."
Princess Luna,Ponies will no longer be in control of their world. That power will belong solely to Tirek.
Princess Celestia,"There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic. With Discord by his side, we will not be able to stop him from taking it."
Princess Luna,"Once it is in his possession, his power will know no bounds, and all hope will be lost."
Princess Celestia,But there is one solution. It is only by making this sacrifice that Equestria and the lands beyond it might be saved. We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
Fluttershy,"What's wrong, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.
Lord Tirek,"I am Lord Tirek, and I will take what should have been mine long ago."
Princess Luna,"With each passing moment, he grows stronger still."
Princess Cadance,And I know just the princess who can stop him.
Princess Celestia,I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek.
Discord,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?"
Discord,Haven't you girls just learned so much?
Twilight Sparkle,And there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked.
Twilight Sparkle,Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change.
Twilight Sparkle,There's still one key missing. My element.
Lord Tirek,"Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness."
Princess Luna,Discord has betrayed the ponies of Equestria and joined forces with Tirek.
Princess Celestia,There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic.
Princess Celestia,We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
Princess Luna,"Tirek is set on possessing Alicorn magic. When he comes for us, we cannot have what he is looking for."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm more than willing to do my part and give up my magic.
Princess Luna,You misunderstand. Our magic cannot just disappear into thin air. Somepony must keep it safe.
Princess Cadance,"That somepony is you, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,Why me?
Princess Celestia,"We do not believe that Tirek is aware that a fourth Alicorn princess exists in Equestria. If we transfer our magic to you, Tirek will not know where it has gone."
Princess Cadance,Do you understand what we're asking of you?
Twilight Sparkle,Yes. It's just... I'm only now learning how to control my own Alicorn magic. To take on even more<U+0096>
Princess Cadance,"Twilight, you represent the element of magic. If there is anypony who can do this, it's you."
Twilight Sparkle,"Taking on this task will be one of the most difficult things I'll ever do, but with the help of my friends<U+0096>"
Princess Celestia,"I'm sorry, Princess Twilight, but you must keep your new abilities a secret. I fear that your friends being aware of your new power could put them at great risk. Do you still think you can take on this responsibility?"
Twilight Sparkle,This is the role I am meant to play as a princess of Equestria! I will not fail to do my duty!
Princess Celestia,Then we must begin at once.
Discord,[shivers] That can't be right.
Lord Tirek,What can't be right?
Discord,Nothing. Carry on.
Princess Celestia,[out of breath] It is done.
Spike,[snoring] You weren't gone very long. Does that mean everything's okay?
Spike,"In that case, I'm going back to bed. Sun's not up... and neither am I."
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] That's strange. The sun should be up by now... [gasps] The sun should be up by now! [inhales, exhales] You can do this."
Discord,"Shining Armor, why, whatever are you doing here?"
Shining Armor,"Back off, traitor."
Lord Tirek,The only one Discord betrayed was himself. Abandoning his true nature to make friends with weak-minded equines who offer him nothing!
Shining Armor,[weakly] How... could you... do this...?
Lord Tirek,Why don't you go and have a little fun? I won't stand in your way.
Lord Tirek,[inhales] What have you done?! [inhales] Where is your magic?!
Twilight Sparkle,I have to gain better control. I sure can't practice here.
Spike,"Uh, Twilight, [pants] where are we goin'?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, uh, hi, Spike. Uh, gotta go... somewhere... else."
Twilight Sparkle,Waaaaah! Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,Yiiiipe!
Twilight Sparkle,Ooh!
Fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness, are you all right?"
Applejack,"Jumpin' junebugs, Twilight! When did you learn to fly that fast?"
Twilight Sparkle,I must have caught a particularly strong breeze... or something.
Rainbow Dash,"Must have been ""or something"", because there wasn't any breeze up there."
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know what happened, but I don't really have time to figure it out right now."
Rarity,"Another visit to the Castle of the Two Sisters, I presume? We'd be more than happy to accompany you!"
Twilight Sparkle,Not today!
Twilight Sparkle,Tirek may still be a threat. I need you all to stay here and encourage everypony to remain inside.
Lord Tirek,"Getting rid of your magic so that I cannot take it from you? That was your plan? How does it feel, knowing that soon, every Pegasus, unicorn and Earth pony will bow to my will, and that there is nothing you can do to stop it?"
Princess Celestia,"You will not prevail, Tirek."
Lord Tirek,Give my regards to Cerberus.
Discord,"You meant our will, didn't you?"
Lord Tirek,"Of course. Here, I want you to have something. This was given to me by someone very close to me. I give it to you as a sign of my gratitude and loyalty."
Discord,"Oh, my! I do love a good accessory. I suppose that's Rarity's influence."
Lord Tirek,"[laughs] Amusing. But we have no time for such things. With the princesses out of the way, we can now<U+0096> is this meant to be humorous?!"
Discord,"Oh, no, I haven't touched that one yet."
Lord Tirek,There's a fourth? And you did not tell me this?!
Discord,I just needed some assurance that you truly considered this a team effort. And now I have it.
Lord Tirek,Then where can we find this fourth princess? Where is her castle?
Lord Tirek,Not for much longer.
Applejack,"Alright, y'all. I think we've warned everypony to stay inside."
Fluttershy,I'm sure Discord will catch Tirek and this will all be over soon.
Rainbow Dash,I'll bet he takes his sweet time.
Discord,Or perhaps these things just take time.
Fluttershy,[gasps] You're back! Did you bring the cucumber sandwiches?
Discord,I did. I imagine they'll be your last decent meal for quite some time.
Discord,Ta-da!
Lord Tirek,You've gathered up all of them?
Discord,"And her little dragon, too."
Fluttershy,[crying] Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends!
Discord,"Oh, we were. But Tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties. Surely you saw this coming."
Fluttershy,[crying] I didn't. I really didn't.
Lord Tirek,You really think she'd do anything for them?
Discord,"If Twilight has magic to give, it will be yours. Soon there won't be a Pegasus, Earth pony or unicorn who will be able to stand up against us."
Lord Tirek,Us? Who said anything about us?
Discord,You did.
Lord Tirek,"You've helped me grow strong, you've provided the means by which I can obtain Princess Twilight's magic, and now you are no longer of any use to me."
Discord,[weakly] But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty. A gift from someone close to you.
Lord Tirek,My brother who betrayed me. It is as worthless as he is.
Applejack,Surely you saw this comin'.
Discord,[weakly] I didn't. I truly didn't.
Twilight Sparkle,I can do this.
Twilight Sparkle,See! Ha! Perfectly controlled teleportation<U+0096>
Lord Tirek,Princess Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Tirek!
Lord Tirek,You have something that belongs to me!
Lord Tirek,Now I understand what your fellow princesses have done!
Lord Tirek,"It appears we are at an impasse. How about a trade, Princess Twilight? Their release for all the Alicorn magic in Equestria."
Lord Tirek,"What's it going to be, Princess?"
Rainbow Dash,"[muffled] Don't do it, Twilight!"
Fluttershy,[muffled] We aren't worth it!
Discord,"[muffled] Oh, but you are, Fluttershy. You're the pony that taught me that friendship is magic. I had magic and friendship, and now I don't have either."
Lord Tirek,"Enough! I want an answer, and I want it now!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I will give you my magic, in exchange for my friends."
Lord Tirek,As you wish.
Twilight Sparkle,All of my friends.
Lord Tirek,"After the way he has betrayed you, you still call him a 'friend'?"
Twilight Sparkle,Release him!
Lord Tirek,If that's what you want.
Discord,"Thank you, Twilight. [to Fluttershy, hushed] I'm sorry."
Fluttershy,I know.
Lord Tirek,Your turn.
Lord Tirek,[roars] Yes!
Spike,"Twilight, what were you thinking?!"
Discord,"Tirek tricked me into believing that he could offer me something more valuable than friendship. But there is nothing worth more. I see that now. He lied when he said that this medallion was given as a sign of gratitude and loyalty. But when I say that it is a sign of our true friendship, I am telling the truth."
Applejack,You think that might be the last one we need?
Twilight Sparkle,We have to get to the chest.
Twilight Sparkle,Together! I think we have to do this together!
Lord Tirek,How is this possible?! You have no magic!
Twilight Sparkle,"You're wrong, Tirek! I may have given you my Alicorn magic, but I carry within me the most powerful magic of all!"
Rarity,Sweet Celestia! Are you all seeing what I'm seeing?
Twilight Sparkle,But... whose is it?
Princess Celestia,"I believe it is yours, Princess Twilight."
Princess Celestia,You've been wondering what you are meant to do as a princess. Do you know now?
Twilight Sparkle,"As princess, I believe I have the power to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. That is the role I am meant to have in our world! The role I choose to have! But I didn't defeat Tirek on my own <U+0096> it took all of us to unlock the chest!"
Princess Celestia,Then it is unlikely you are meant to take on this task alone.
Pinkie Pie,Wowee!
Princess Celestia,"You are now Twilight Sparkle, the princess of friendship. But what is the princess of friendship without her friends?"
Discord,"Wait a minute, where's my throne?!"
Fluttershy,I don't think you're quite there yet.
Discord,"[chuckles] Yes, well, I suppose not."
Twilight Sparkle,"Each one of us has something special That makes us different, that makes us rare"
Fluttershy,We have a light that shines within us That we were always meant to share
All,And when we come together Combine the light that shines within There is nothing we can't do There is no battle we can't win
Others,When we come together There'll be a star to guide the way It's inside us every day
Others,See it now! See it now!
Others,Let the rainbow remind you That together we will always shine Let the rainbow remind you That forever this will be our time
Twilight Sparkle,Let the rainbow remind you That together we will always shine
Twilight Sparkle,Let's go through this one more time.
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] We've been over it like a million times, Twilight! We found all six keys, defeated Tirek, and got this sweet castle! End of story!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, but why?"
Applejack,"I dunno, sugarcube. Maybe it's just your new house and there ain't nothin' more to it than that."
Rarity,"I must say, speaking strictly on aesthetics, there really doesn't need to be more to it. It's all simply divine!"
Fluttershy,"I agree with Twilight. And Rarity. And Applejack. And Rainbow Dash. And Pinkie Pie. Oh, and probably Spike."
Twilight Sparkle,"As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville? It doesn't make any sense."
Spike,[groans] Is that new? I like it.
Spike,This is incredible! It's got all of Equestria!
Pinkie Pie,"Hi, Mom and Dad!"
Fluttershy,"But if this is Ponyville, why are our cutie marks over there?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know. But it seems like the map wants us to find out. The Tree, the chest, this castle, and now the map. How can we not follow it?"
Rainbow Dash,Y'know what? There's a ton of room for dangerous adventure along that route. Count me in!
Applejack,"Aw, shoot, I reckon you're right."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, I was planning on organizing my baking sheets, but okay!"
Rarity,[sighs] Very well.
Fluttershy,"Um, maybe I'll just stay here with Spike."
Spike,"Awesome! Me and Big Mac have a huge weekend ahead of us talkin' hoofball, and... and trading hoofball cards, and arguing about hoofball stats..."
Fluttershy,"O-o-on second thought, m-m-maybe I'd better go with them. In case they need me."
Twilight Sparkle,Looks like it's time for a road trip.
Spike,"Well, suit yourself. But he's got a Hock Fetlock rookie card I plan to sweet-talk right into these hot little claws."
Twilight Sparkle,That's it! That's the place on the map!
Rarity,Right. Let's get down there and find the spa.
Twilight Sparkle,Wait. We don't know why the map sent us here. We shouldn't just walk right in. It could be dangerous.
Rainbow Dash,Yes!
Pinkie Pie,"Stay behind me, everypony! I'm on it!"
Applejack,"Careful, Pinkie!"
Rainbow Dash,This is where the map sent us? It looks like the most boring place in Equestria.
Applejack,It's just an ordinary village full of ordinary pony folk.
Rarity,It could certainly use a few more architectural flourishes. Or any architectural flourishes.
Fluttershy,I think it's lovely.
Pinkie Pie,I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. I know smiles. And those smiles? They're just not right.
Twilight Sparkle,Forget the smiles. Look at the cutie marks.
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, that's weird."
Twilight Sparkle,An entire village with the same cutie mark? How can that be?
Rainbow Dash,I bet there's some sort of horrific monster behind it.
Twilight Sparkle,What makes you say that?
Rainbow Dash,'Cause fighting a horrific monster would be super-awesome!
Applejack,"I reckon we just ought to head into town and talk to some locals, find out what's goin' on."
Rainbow Dash,"Great idea, AJ. Let's go!"
Pinkie Pie,Those smiles are bad news.
Others,"""Sunny Song"": Welcome!"
Others,S05E01 Unnamed Pegasus Mare # Welcome!

Others,S05E01 Unnamed Unicorn Stallion # Welcome!

Others,"S05E01 Unnamed Unicorn Filly #1, Cotton Cloudy, ""Princess Erroria"", and ""Ruby Pinch"": Welcome!"
Fluttershy,This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria!
Night Glider,Welcome!
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh. Thanks a lot, map."
Party Favor,"Welcome! Pardon my forwardness, but are you an Alicorn?"
Applejack,That there's the Princess of Friendship!
Party Favor,"Well, you've certainly come to the right place for friendship."
Double Diamond,What brings you to town?
Twilight Sparkle,We're not entirely sure.
Double Diamond,"I see. Well, all are welcome here in our little village. My name is Double Diamond, and this is Party Favor."
Applejack,"Howdy, Double Diamond. I'm Applejack, and this here's Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle."
Double Diamond,And you all have your own unique cutie marks.
Twilight Sparkle,"If you don't mind, has there been any sort of... trouble here, lately?"
Double Diamond,"Trouble? Why, I don't think we've ever had trouble in our little village."
Party Favor,It's true. You'll see. Hm.
Double Diamond,Perhaps you'd care to speak to our founder Starlight Glimmer.
Fluttershy,I wish everypony in Equestria was as friendly as these ponies are.
Pinkie Pie,I've got my eye on them. Something's rotten in... whatever the name of this village is that we're in right now!
Double Diamond,"Starlight, we have some new visitors."
Rainbow Dash,[to Applejack] Be ready to fight. We don't know what's gonna come through that door.
Starlight Glimmer,Welcome! I'm so pleased to have you here.
Double Diamond,"This is Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle."
Starlight Glimmer,"Forgive my bluntness, but I'm assuming it's Princess Twilight Sparkle? We don't get many Alicorns around here."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, but ""Twilight"" is fine."
Starlight Glimmer,So! How did you hear of our little village?
Twilight Sparkle,It's kind of a long story. Let's just say we found it on a map.
Pinkie Pie,"Technically, it's a Tree-chest-castle-map!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, however you found us, we're happy to have you! We're happy to have anypony who wants to experience true friendship for the first time."
Applejack,Say what?
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, indeed. That's what's so unique about our village, you see. Around here, we don't flaunt our special talents because we don't have any special talents to flaunt."
Twilight Sparkle,Is that why you all have those cutie marks?
Starlight Glimmer,Perhaps it would be easier to understand if I gave you a tour of the village!
Starlight Glimmer,"Heads high, ponies! Marching proud! [whistle blows] All together now! Every one of you! No pony left behind!"
Others,Life is so grand in Our Town We're always filled with cheer We never have to look around To know that we're all here
Citizens,"In Our Town, in Our Town We don't have to wait To find out that our destiny Is just to emulate"
Starlight Glimmer,"Let's see those big, happy smiles!"
Others,Life is a smile in Our Town Our cutie mark's the same Because we do not separate Ourselves by more than name
Citizens,"In Our Town, in Our Town We dare not compete Winning only breeds the worst Ego-filled conceit"
Starlight Glimmer,You see? Now everypony wins!
Others,Life is a joy in Our Town We're all equal here No one is superior And no one shakes in fear
Citizens,"In Our Town, in Our Town We work as a team You can't have a nightmare If you never dream"
Starlight Glimmer,Other ponies argue Do you ever wonder why? When you think your talent's special You don't see eye-to-eye
Others,There's just too many differences That lead to disarray But when you learn to act as one It's like a holiday
Citizens,"In Our Town, in Our Town We don't complicate When you learn to simplify Life is oh, so great"
Others,Join in our utopia Come out of the dark Banded by equality By our cutie mark!
Rainbow Dash,"[laughing] You're kidding, right? Give up our cutie marks? No way!"
Fluttershy,"Rainbow Dash, don't be so rude. I don't think we should judge them. They all seem perfectly happy with their choice."
Pinkie Pie,"Don't believe their smiles, Fluttershy."
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, I guess we're just a little confused by all of this."
Starlight Glimmer,"We have no judgements here in our village. Each of us was confused once as well, blinded by the false promise of our cutie marks."
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is she for real?"
Twilight Sparkle,"When we were sent to this village, we assumed it was to help in some way. But, well, it doesn't seem like you need any help."
Starlight Glimmer,"Have you considered perhaps that you might have been sent here so we could help you? After all, nopony has ever come to our village and wanted to leave. Why should you be any different? But that is entirely your choice. Please enjoy our little corner of Equestria. We're all quite fond of it. No doubt you will be as well. Double Diamond, please help our guests with whatever they might need."
Double Diamond,Of course.
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, this will certainly provide a boost to our little community. When the rest of Equestria sees that a princess gave up her cutie mark to join us, they'll finally understand what we're trying to accomplish."
Others,S05E01 Unnamed Unicorn Stallion # Welcome!
Others,"""Ivy Vine"": Welcome!"
Others,"""Sunny Song"": Welcome!"
Twilight Sparkle,A cutie mark is a representation of a pony's unique talents and skills. How is it possible to<U+0097>
Rarity,[gasps] What in the name of Equestria is that?!
Others,"""Burlap"": Welcome! Care to sample some local fashion? We've got cloaks this month!"
Rarity,"[gagging] Wha<U+0097> Ooh, er, perhaps another time, good sir, thank you. [whispering] No wonder nopony's wearing anything!"
Fluttershy,"[hushed] Really, girls! They may do things a bit differently than we're used to, but that's no reason to be rude."
Rainbow Dash,"[hushed] No, the reason to be rude is that they all keep staring at us!"
Double Diamond,Need something?
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, no! We're good! [hushed] Fluttershy's right. If we're going to get to the bottom of why the map sent us here, we'll need the help of these ponies."
Applejack,I think we ran off to the end of Equestria before we even knew what that map was!
Pinkie Pie,"If we were at the end of Equestria, we'd be sitting on a big 'A'! [giggles] Get it?"
Rarity,"Oh, please, Miss Pie! This is hardly the time for jokes! We've come all this way and for what?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] Maybe you're right. But we're here now, and it sure feels like something's wrong."
Applejack,That and two bits'll get you a cup of cider.
Sugar Belle,Is this a bad time?
Fluttershy,"We shouldn't be bickering like this in front of our new friends. Really, Applejack, you're almost as bad as Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,Don't drag me into this!
Sugar Belle,Is your friendship ending?
Pinkie Pie,Are you crazy?! We'd never let a disagreement get in the way of food!
Sugar Belle,"O-kay, well, my name is Sugar Belle. What can I bring you? We have: muffins..."
Twilight Sparkle,Then I guess we'll take six muffins!
Pinkie Pie,Make that twelve! What? I'm hungry!
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] Come on, girls. We've got to stick together. It doesn't matter what happened before, we're here now."
Applejack,"I guess you're right. And the sooner we figure out why, the sooner we can go home."
Sugar Belle,"Forgive me for overhearing, but just a moment ago you were disagreeing, and now it sounds like you're... agreeing."
Applejack,Uh-huh...
Sugar Belle,"Well, you had such differing opinions <U+0096> and cutie marks."
Rarity,"We have differing opinions all the time, darling."
Sugar Belle,But you look like you're friends.
Twilight Sparkle,We are friends. A simple disagreement wouldn't change that.
Sugar Belle,"I'm sorry, I'm just having a hard time understanding. Different talents lead to different opinions, which lead to bitterness and misery. So... why aren't you bitter and...?"
Pinkie Pie,[choking] Blech! Mmmm... good...
Sugar Belle,"It's all right. I know I'm not a very good baker. At least, I know I'm not any better than anypony else in the village. Well, I... hope you enjoy our little village!"
Sugar Belle,[hushed] Come inside before you go! Meet me downstairs!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, that was weird too."
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] Let's all sit here and eat these muffins and act normal. I think we're being watched.
Rainbow Dash,You think?
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] No, not like that! I mean somepony here doesn't want us talking to Sugar Belle."
Applejack,"I got an idea. But you gotta eat all of them muffins, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,Me?! Why me?!
Applejack,"[hushed] You got a stronger stomach than any of us, and that filly in there might be our best chance at findin' out what the hay is goin' on round here."
Applejack,"[stilted] I can't believe you ate all our muffins, Pinkie Pie! We'd best go inside and get some more!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Nice work, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,I've accidentally eaten cardboard tastier than that...
Twilight Sparkle,Hello? Sugar Belle?
Sugar Belle,Thank you for coming!
Twilight Sparkle,Why did you want us to come down here?
Sugar Belle,So nopony could see what's about to happen.
Party Favor,Are you really the Princess of Friendship?
Night Glider,Do you know Princess Celestia?
Sugar Belle,I love your cutie mark!
Night Glider,How can you be friends with different cutie marks? Don't you end up hating each other?
Sugar Belle,"Oh, look at this one! This one's great too! I'd love to have my special talent back even just for a day! Make something besides those disgusting muffins..."
Rainbow Dash,So what's stopping you? Go get your cutie marks back.
Party Favor,"Daydreaming is one thing, but you mean actually having it put back on? That seems extreme."
Sugar Belle,I'm not sure Starlight would like that. She wants us all to be happy in our sameness.
Twilight Sparkle,How do you take somepony's cutie mark anyway?
Night Glider,The cutie unmarking is a beautiful experience! Starlight uses the Staff of Sameness to magically take them away and replace them with these.
Twilight Sparkle,But nopony should keep you from your cutie mark. It represents such an essential part of who you are.
Night Glider,"Oh, we're not kept from them. They're in the vault up in the caves. We can visit them any time we like to remind us of the heartache of a life with special talents."
Twilight Sparkle,Can we visit this cave?
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault. We hope someday every pony in Equestria will make a pilgrimage here to our little village to have theirs removed too, and our message of [continues under] perfectly equal friendship can finally spread across the land."
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed, over] This must be the reason we're here."
Pinkie Pie,"[hushed, over] ""Pilgrimaging""?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] No, helping those ponies get their cutie marks back."
Fluttershy,"[hushed] Oh, are you sure, Twilight? Maybe they miss them a little, but even they didn't seem all that unhappy."
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] Then why did they want to meet us in secret? And why did they ask us not to tell Starlight who told us about the vault? Something's not right.
Starlight Glimmer,Just through here! Behold! Our cutie mark vault!
Twilight Sparkle,I've never seen anything like it!
Starlight Glimmer,And here is the Staff of Sameness. It was one of the great Mage Meadowbrook's nine enchanted items. We are incredibly fortunate to have it here. This is the tool that allows us to free ourselves from our marks! I'm curious <U+0096> how did the subject of the vault come up?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, some ponies were telling us how much they missed their cutie marks, and<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie,Oops...
Starlight Glimmer,"[gasps] Were they? Well, it seems you inspire all sorts of free thinking, don't you?"
Rarity,"[laughs nervously] Well, w-we certainly didn't intend to cause any disruptions to your charming little<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,"Good. Let's just make sure of that, shall we?"
Twilight Sparkle,It's a trap!
Starlight Glimmer,Aw. I don't blame you for what you tried to do here today. You've spent your whole lives thinking those marks are a good thing.
Twilight Sparkle,Give them back!
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, now you can spend the rest of your lives here with us! And we'll teach you just how much better life can be without your cutie marks!"
Twilight Sparkle,"As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville?"
Spike,This is incredible! It's got all of Equestria!
Fluttershy,Why are our cutie marks over there?
Twilight Sparkle,Seems like the map wants us to find out.
Twilight Sparkle,An entire village with the same cutie mark?
Starlight Glimmer,Welcome!
Fluttershy,This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria!
Starlight Glimmer,I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault.
Twilight Sparkle,It's a trap!
Starlight Glimmer,Now you can spend the rest of your lives here without your cutie marks!
Starlight Glimmer,"[slightly muffled, over loudspeaker] In sameness, there is peace. Exceptionalism is a lie."
Starlight Glimmer,Free yourself from your cutie mark. Choose equality as your special talent.
Starlight Glimmer,[voice fades under] Difference is frustration. To excel is to fail.
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, this is pretty good!"
Starlight Glimmer,[under] Be your best by never being your best.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh, we've gotta find a way out of here! I can't take much more of that voice!"
Fluttershy,"There, there, Rarity... It's not so bad..."
Rarity,"Yes, it is! Look at those drapes! I have no idea if they're tacky or not!"
Fluttershy,"Well, I think they're nice."
Rarity,[crying] So do I!
Fluttershy,"Oh, thank goodness! Can you help us, little birdie?"
Fluttershy,"Go on, now! Fly away and get us help!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, even tweets don't make sense any more!"
Applejack,[grunts] This door's shut tighter than a... summer of...
Applejack,"...uh, piglets in... shoot! I can't even make countryisms no more!"
Pinkie Pie,I don't know! Maybe it'll be super fun to be all the same!
Pinkie Pie,"Sort of. More pleasant than fun, I guess..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Something odd about that staff. I haven't studied Eastern unicorns as much as I should have, but I'm pretty sure Meadowbrook only had eight magical items, not nine. And I don't remember any of them being a staff."
Applejack,"Well, it looks like you'll have plenty of time to try to think about it."
Twilight Sparkle,I've got it!
Twilight Sparkle,I know how we can get out!
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Forget it, Twilight. This door's not opening."
Rarity,And I'm afraid the windows are much too small for escape.
Twilight Sparkle,But there is a third way.
Pinkie Pie,Of course! Eventually the wind and the weather will wear down the walls until they start to crumble! Then all we have to do is wait for a big enough hole to form and we can just walk out! It's the perfect plan!
Pinkie Pie,I guess.
Twilight Sparkle,We don't actually have to escape. They'll just let us out when they think we've accepted their philosophy!
Applejack,But they're never gonna believe we switched over in just one night.
Twilight Sparkle,There's one of us they might believe.
Fluttershy,Oh! Me?!
Rainbow Dash,You've been saying how great this place is since we got here!
Fluttershy,"But that's because everypony's so nice and their village is so pretty, and, and... Oh, you're right. They probably would believe me. I hate to lie to them. They've been so welcoming and friendly... aside from locking us in here and trying to brainwash us into abandoning the things that make us special... Okay. I'll do it."
Pinkie Pie,"Woo-hoo! I mean, cool."
Fluttershy,But what do I do once I'm out?
Twilight Sparkle,You've gotta find a way to get our cutie marks back.
Starlight Glimmer,"[over loudspeaker] Oh, good morning!"
Starlight Glimmer,"I trust you had a pleasant night? This way, please. There are some friends who'd like to see you. Gather round, friends, gather round! We've come to ask if any of you are ready to join us! There are so many friends to be made once you realize you don't need your cutie marks or the talents that come with them."
Double Diamond,We have a welcome ceremony for new friends! The whole village joins together to build you your own cottage<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"Not interested! You may have them now, but we're going to get our cutie marks back!"
Applejack,"Y'all don't understand, do ya? You can't force nopony to be friends! It don't work like that!"
Others,"""Sunny Song"": Please, join us!"
Others,"""Rosemary"": We love new friends!"
Starlight Glimmer,"It's all right, everypony. This is a perfectly normal part of the equalization process for those who haven't... quite seen the light yet. We'll try again tomorrow once you've had a bit more time to consider our philosophy!"
Fluttershy,I'd like to join!
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy? How could you?!
Fluttershy,"If giving up my cutie mark means I get to stay in this lovely village with these lovely ponies, then I'll do it."
Starlight Glimmer,"We have a new friend, everypony!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Now, there's one more order of business. It seems some in our midst might be... dissatisfied with the village life!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Unfortunately, it's all too true, my friends! [to Fluttershy] Will you kindly tell us the names of those friends who so desperately miss their cutie marks that they would sneak around in the shadows talking to strangers about it? Just so we can be sure your intentions are indeed pure."
Fluttershy,"Um, I don't know who they were. Um, I'm sorry. I don't know your names and faces yet."
Starlight Glimmer,Nonsense! Obviously these ponies must have asked you directly. Kindly point them out!
Party Favor,It was me! It was only me! But I only wanted it back for a little while!
Starlight Glimmer,And you're quite certain it was only you?
Party Favor,I just wanted to remember what it was like.
Starlight Glimmer,And no thought to the pain you'd cause your friends. Such selfishness.
Party Favor,"I'm sorry, everypony! I never wanted to leave the village! I love all of<U+0097>"
Party Favor,What was I thinking?! I can't believe I even considered asking for my cutie mark back.
Rainbow Dash,Don't worry. Fluttershy will have us out of here in no time!
Party Favor,Didn't you see what just happened out there?! Your friend has accepted our way! You will all accept our way! It's only a matter of time!
Rainbow Dash,This guy's a barrel of laughs.
Pinkie Pie,[flatly] Laughs don't come in barrels. They come from inside you as your body's response to delight.
Applejack,[hushed] So what are we gonna do while Fluttershy's out there lookin' for our [whispering] cutie marks?
Twilight Sparkle,"We have to stay as positive as we can. If Party Favor sees how much we really do like each other, even though we're all different, maybe we can use him to spread our message to the rest of the village."
Rarity,Let's hope they don't convert any of us first.
Others,"""Rocky Storm"": Welcome!"
Others,S05E01 Unnamed Pegasus Mare # Welcome!
Others,S05E01 Unnamed Unicorn Stallion # Welcome!
Fluttershy,"Gosh, you really are the nicest ponies I've ever met."
Starlight Glimmer,"Come. All new friends stay with me until their cottage is completed. Let's get you settled, and then you can enjoy all that our little village has to offer."
Fluttershy,"[coughing] Brrrrrr! [sighs] Get the cutie marks back. That's all you've gotta do, Fluttershy. Just sneak through the dark up to that spooky old cave with the scary magical staff and get the cutie marks back."
Fluttershy,"Okay, you're doing great. The cave's gotta be close now..."
Starlight Glimmer,"Excellent work, Double Diamond."
Double Diamond,"Of course, but I don't understand why you wanted me to bring them here. Fluttershy is one of us now. Surely she can be trusted."
Starlight Glimmer,This one belongs to a princess. It could be very important to our cause.
Double Diamond,"But if Twilight Sparkle becomes our friend, then why do we care about this old cutie mark?"
Starlight Glimmer,"I just want to keep them close until everything is... settled. You may go, Double Diamond."
Fluttershy,"Oh, dear. How am I ever going to get the cutie marks back now?"
Starlight Glimmer,Ow!
Starlight Glimmer,"Ugh! Starlight, you clumsy foal!"
Fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, no..."
Starlight Glimmer,"I've got a good feeling about today! So, do any of you have anything you'd like to say? Aw, pity. Well, let's try this again tomorrow, shall we? No new friends today, I'm afraid!"
Fluttershy,Wait! I'd like to lock them in.
Starlight Glimmer,"Marvelous, Fluttershy! That's the spirit! Party Favor, will you join us, please?"
Party Favor,"I'm sorry, Starlight! I'm sorry, everypony! I've seen the error of my ways! I never want to look at my cutie mark again!"
Starlight Glimmer,It seems there's cause for celebration after all!
Party Favor,"They tried to break me! They wouldn't stop talking about how different they are, and that somehow makes their friendship stronger!"
Starlight Glimmer,Such backwards thinking.
Party Favor,"But I didn't listen! I knew what they were up to, and I didn't listen!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Well done, Party Favor! We welcome you back with open hooves!"
Fluttershy,"Um, Starlight? I think we might have one more friend joining us today."
Starlight Glimmer,Is this true?
Twilight Sparkle,"I-I think so. But I just want to be sure. If I agree to leave my cutie mark in the vault, I'll really be happier?"
Starlight Glimmer,Just look around! Equality has given us more happiness than you've ever known!
Twilight Sparkle,And you wouldn't let me just live here in the village with my old cutie mark?
Starlight Glimmer,Out of the question. A pony with a different cutie mark in our midst would destroy our entire philosophy. We are all equal here!
Fluttershy,Then how do you explain this?!
Starlight Glimmer,I knew you couldn't be trusted! No! Get away!
Starlight Glimmer,"Wha... What are you looking at?! They're the problem, not me!"
Party Favor,How could you?
Double Diamond,You said cutie marks were evil! You said special talents led to pain and heartache!
Starlight Glimmer,They do! Don't you see?! Look at them!
Sugar Belle,Then why? Why did you take ours and not give up your own?
Starlight Glimmer,"I... I had to, you fools! How could I collect your cutie marks without my magic?!"
Night Glider,But the staff has all the magic we need!
Starlight Glimmer,The staff is a piece of wood I found in the desert! It's my magic that makes all this possible! You'd all still be living your miserable lives thinking you're better than everypony else if it weren't for my magical abilities! I brought you friendship! I brought you equality! I created harmony!
Double Diamond,You lied to us!
Starlight Glimmer,So what? E-Everything else I said is true! The only way to be happy is if we're all equal!
Party Favor,Except for you.
Twilight Sparkle,"Everypony has unique talents and gifts, and when we share them with each other, that's how rea<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,QUIET!
Sugar Belle,"You can't have a cutie mark, Starlight! Either we're all equal, or none of us are!"
Double Diamond,Come on! Let's get our cutie marks back!
Rainbow Dash,Come on! Let's go get our cutie marks!
Fluttershy,Our cutie marks aren't in the vault! They're in there with her!
Double Diamond,"Stand back, everypony!"
Rarity,"Even without my cutie mark, I can tell this is beautiful!"
Starlight Glimmer,They think they can come to my village and disrupt my life? Let's see how they like spending the rest of their lives without their precious cutie marks!
Night Glider,"Stand back, everypony!"
Fluttershy,They're gone! They were right over there!
Rainbow Dash,Look!
Party Favor,"She's headed for the pass! If she makes it into those mountains, we'll never find her!"
Pinkie Pie,These are amazing!
Sugar Belle,There's a whole network of caves up there! Your cutie marks will be gone forever!
Applejack,"Then let's get moving, y'all!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, come on!"
Starlight Glimmer,Are you all so willing to give up everything because of these strangers?!
Sugar Belle,"We gave up everything for you, because we thought you were our friend!"
Rainbow Dash,I can't believe we have to count on these other ponies to save our cutie marks!
Twilight Sparkle,"If we hadn't come here to help them, they'd still be living under her rules! Now it's their turn to help us!"
Fluttershy,And I know they can do it!
Sugar Belle,My newest recipe <U+0096> snow pie!
Rainbow Dash,She's gonna get away!
Double Diamond,Whoa! These are my old skis! This is where I first met Starlight!
Night Glider,Maybe you can reminisce another time! She's almost to the caves!
Double Diamond,Feel like an air drop?
Applejack,"Yee-haw! Finally, I can buck like a five-bit snake herder in an Appleloosa ranch house again!"
Fluttershy,"And you got your countryisms back, too!"
Starlight Glimmer,Wh<U+0096> I studied that spell for years! How can you<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,I studied magic for years too! But what I didn't know then was that studying could only take me so far. Each of my friends has taught me something different about myself! It was their unique gifts and passions and personalities that helped bring out the magic inside of me! I never would have learned that I represent the element of magic without these five! And I certainly wouldn't be here to stop you now!
Starlight Glimmer,Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could've had otherwise!
Double Diamond,How do you know that?! You never even gave us a chance!
Rainbow Dash,She's getting away!
Double Diamond,We'll never find her in there!
Twilight Sparkle,"We just have to hope that when she's had a chance to think it over, she realizes that you all have taught her something."
Party Favor,"It's you who have taught us something. We all came to this village because we were searching for something missing from our lives. We thought Starlight had given it to us, but now... now it seems it was in front of us all along. It's us!"
Twilight Sparkle,Does that mean you'll stay in the village?
Night Glider,It's our home. I'm not going anywhere.
Double Diamond,This is a chance for all of us to get to know each other again for the very first time!
Sugar Belle,And I finally have a chance to bake something besides terrible muffins!
Pinkie Pie,Now those are real smiles.
Applejack,I'll never get used to that.
Rarity,I think it's divine.
Fluttershy,Does that mean that the map is calling us somewhere else?
Twilight Sparkle,I have a feeling it means our work here is done.
Applejack,"Looks like you were right, Twilight. The map did have a reason for sendin' us here. We brought real friendship to these here ponies. Guess that's why you're the Princess of Friendship."
Twilight Sparkle,"But the map didn't send me. It sent us. You're a part of me, all of you. And there's no doubt you're a part of my mission to spread friendship too."
Pinkie Pie,"This feels like an ending! It doesn't have to be an ending yet, right? 'Cause that Sugar Belle can bake!"
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe we can stay a little while longer. Come on!
Fluttershy,"Phew! Thanks for helping me get them so fresh and clean, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"No problem, happy to do it!"
Fluttershy,"You probably can't wait to get back to your castle and take your own bath, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,Aren't there more animals that need cleaning?
Fluttershy,"I think you and I are the only ones left, and I can't wait to get the mud out of my mane."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, no! Angel got dirty! I'd better stay longer to help give him a bath too!"
Fluttershy,"Thank you ever so much for staying to give Angel a bath too, but, um... I think he's dry."
Fluttershy,Goodness! It's gotten late! You really didn't have to stay all day. Not that we don't appreciate it. Isn't that right?
Fluttershy,"I for one am exhausted. [yawns] Plus, I really need to rest up for that big pancake breakfast tomorrow. [beat] And I'm sure you have to get the castle ready."
Twilight Sparkle,No! The castle's... fine! But maybe I'd better see if Pinkie Pie needs help with the pancakes!
Fluttershy,"[knocking] Um, Angel?"
Applejack,"[gulps] Mm, these are delicious, Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie,"[slurps, gulps] Thanks! Twilight spent all night helping me pick the flavor! I kept thinking we'd found the right one, but she insisted I make even more to try. And more. And more and more and more and more! It was like she never wanted to<U+0097>"
Fluttershy,Leave?
Pinkie Pie,"Exactly! [chomp] Eventually we ran out of time so we just went with every-berry-any-chip-surprise! [to Rarity, hushed] The surprise is I lost a measuring spoon in the batter. Somepony's gonna get a very special pancake!"
Rainbow Dash,"Up all night, huh? Is that why she's so, uh... out of it?"
Fluttershy,"Um, I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but has anypony else noticed that Twilight has been a little too helpful lately?"
Applejack,"Now that you mention it, she was lendin' a hoof at Sweet Apple Acres the other day and stuck around 'til near midnight. Dug up fifty tree-plantin' holes when all I needed was ten."
Rarity,She spent an entire afternoon rearranging a single gem drawer at the boutique. An entire afternoon!
Rainbow Dash,"You think that's weird? She raced me, like, a hundred times the other day. And lost every time! She just kept goin'! Best out of ten, best out of twenty, best out of a hundred! I mean, I know hanging out with me is awesome, but it was like she'd rather keep losing than<U+0097>"
Fluttershy,Leave?
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. Who does that?
Applejack,"Somepony who's avoidin' somethin', that's who. Soon as she wakes up, we're gonna find out what."
Pinkie Pie,[coughs] I win!
Twilight Sparkle,"Huh?! I'm pancake! I mean, awake..."
Applejack,"Uh, Twilight? Is there somethin' you wanna tell us?"
Rarity,"You know how much we appreciate all you do for us, and we simply adore having you around... but... we worry you might be... ahem... avoiding something else?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, has it been that obvious? I've been... the thing is... I know it's silly, but I... I've been avoiding... this place."
Rarity,[gasps] Why in Equestria would you want to avoid such a gorgeous castle?
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, this place has everything! Big tall ceilings that make you feel tiny! Shiny new floors that are cold to the touch! Brrr! And it even has loooong empty hallways!"
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, I get it."
Twilight Sparkle,The castle is amazing. But it just... [sighs] It doesn't feel like home.
Rarity,"[chuckling] Oh, is that all? Why, you simply need to decorate, darling. Make this space your own!"
Twilight Sparkle,It's just so daunting! Look how big it is! I-I don't even know where to start!
Rarity,"You can start by letting us do it for you. We will make this the castle of your dreams while you go to the Ponyville spa for some much needed rest and relaxation. I'm saying this with love, but... have you looked in a mirror lately? I've never seen you look this... mmmm..."
Fluttershy,Frazzled?
Rarity,Yes! That is absolutely the word I was going to use.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ooh, I guess I do need a little help. And so does my castle. And I just know you'll do a great job, because nopony knows me better than you."
Applejack,We'll make this place feel cozier than hot cider on a rainy day.
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps] There's gonna be cider?! [beat] Uh, I mean, let's decorate!"
Spike,"Oh, no! Did I miss the pancakes?!"
Spike,"I sleep like a baby under that cold, cavernous ceiling."
Rarity,"Spike, I'm so glad you're here!"
Spike,Really?
Rarity,Yes! You're taking Twilight to the spa!
Applejack,"Come on, y'all! We've got work to do!"
Rainbow Dash,Let's all work together To make this castle shi-i-ine
Rarity,"Once we add some sparkle It'll feel, it'll feel, it'll feel..."
All,It'll feel divine
Applejack,Crates of apples an' bales o' hay Just makes ya feel at home
Fluttershy,Furry friends and some popinjays So she won't be alone
All,"And we'll make, and we'll make, and we'll make This castle a home"
Pinkie Pie,There's nothing like balloons and confetti To greet you every time you walk through the door
Rainbow Dash,She'll need this and those Posters of all my heroes How could anypony awesome ever ask for more?
All,"And we'll make, and we'll make, and we'll make A home she'll adore"
Rarity,Bright curtains of flowing silk and lace
Rainbow Dash,This picture of me winning a race
Pinkie Pie,Party cannons to give her a surprise
Applejack,Hoes and rakes and some more garden supplies
Fluttershy,"Getting hugs from this nice, big, friendly bear"
Rarity,Decorate with some gemstones bright and rare
Rainbow Dash,More of this and that
Pinkie Pie,Don't forget the party hats
Rainbow Dash,How could anypony awesome ask for more than that?
Applejack,Let's all work together
Fluttershy,To show that we have shown
Rarity,Princess Twilight Sparkle
All,"How we make, how we make, how we make This castle a home How we make, how we make This castle a home How we make, how we make This castle a home!"
Rainbow Dash,We sure did... something.
Pinkie Pie,[simultaneously] Together.
Rarity,[simultaneously] All together.
Rainbow Dash,"[unconvincingly] Fluttershy, I love that you brought so many animals."
Fluttershy,Are these your trophies?
Rainbow Dash,I prefer to think of them as everypony's trophies but with my name permanently etched onto them.
Rarity,"[unconvincingly] [laughs] My my, Applejack, bringing the outdoors inside, it's... earthy... What a lovely touch! [sniffs, heaves] Are these quilts vintage?"
Spike,"Hey guys, how do my claws look<U+0097>Sweet Celestia!"
Rarity,"Oh, Spike! Are you and Twilight done already?"
Spike,"Don't worry, I ordered her the super-deluxe mane blow-out! She'll be a while. Man, this place looks terrible!"
Main cast sans Twilight,Phew!
Fluttershy,Thank goodness somepony said something!
Rainbow Dash,"It's pretty bad, right?"
Applejack,This place looks like a mishmash of knickknacks.
Rarity,"Hmm, I suppose it is a little cluttered."
Pinkie Pie,What are you guys talking about? I think it looks super fun!
Pinkie Pie,Whee!
Fluttershy,"Oh! Oh, no! Please don't do that! If you all just take a deep breath and calm down<U+0097>"
Rarity,No! That bunting is embroidered by hoof! Don't you move one more paw!
Rarity,"Everypony, stop!"
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, now it's a mess."
Rainbow Dash,What're we gonna do?!
Spike,"I dunno. But Twilight's blow-out won't take that long. If she was avoiding the castle before, she'll never set hoof in here now!"
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, guys, we've gotta do something! Twilight's counting on us!"
Rarity,"Spike, you've got to get back to that spa and stall her! Whatever you do, don't let her come home!"
Spike,"Like, forever? But we live here."
Spike,"Anything for you, Rarity..."
Applejack,"Okay, we all agree the castle is too cluttered, right? So why doesn't everypony take one of their own decorations out and we'll see how it looks?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, you're back! How do I look?"
Spike,Great!
Twilight Sparkle,"And more importantly, how does the castle look?"
Spike,Great?
Twilight Sparkle,I can't wait to go home and see it!
Spike,"Great! I mean, no! I mean, uh, I'm not... quite ready to go yet. Uh, why don't we have a massage? I was really hoping to get, uh... this thingy!"
Twilight Sparkle,[reading] The 'Extra-strength-hot-stone-deep-tissue massage'?
Spike,[gulps] Yep!
Twilight Sparkle,"I think I'll just have a traditional massage, but you go for it."
Aloe,Did somepony order massages?
Bulk Biceps,"Yeah! Let's do this, little dragon!"
Aloe,"Oh, I hate it when he does that. Come with me, princess."
Applejack,"Come on, Rarity. Everypony has taken somethin' out except you."
Rarity,"Ooh, I know! I simply can't decide."
Rainbow Dash,How about this?
Rarity,No! Not that! Anything but that!
Rainbow Dash,How about these?
Rarity,"Oh, but those brighten up the whole room! They're my favorite accent!"
Rainbow Dash,Then let's lose the curtains! The room wouldn't need brightening if they weren't making it so dark!
Rarity,Not them! They're my favorite too!
Rainbow Dash,"[growls] They can't all be your favorite! Okay, I'm taking down the portrait. We all know what we look like."
Rarity,"[huffs] Well, the room still looks a little bit cluttered, doesn't it? Perhaps I'll take down a poster or two. Only to be helpful, of course!"
Applejack,"Okay, everypony calm down. I'm sure we can find a way to remove the clutter together."
Rarity,"You're absolutely right, dear."
Applejack,"Hey, those are my warmin' quilts!"
Rainbow Dash and Rarity,Together!
Pinkie Pie,"Fluttershy, tell your birds to stop pecking at my balloons!"
Fluttershy,I guess they must not like being scared out of their wits by exploding confetti cannons or something.
Pinkie Pie,But we can't get rid of the cannons! I don't remember where I hid them.
Rarity,Allow me to help.
Applejack,"Oh, no, I'll help you."
Rainbow Dash,Not if I help you first!
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Great suggestion, Spike. I feel totally relaxed."
Spike,[joints cracking] Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow...
Twilight Sparkle,You want to hop on? Maybe I can get us to the castle faster.
Spike,[cracks] Ow! I mean... how... nice is this day? I was hoping we could take the scenic way back.
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know.
Spike,Come on. Walking is good for post-massage circulation.
Twilight Sparkle,Really? I've never heard that theory.
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] I really miss this place, Spike. We had so many wonderful memories here."
Spike,"We did, didn't we...?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike, I'm so sorry. Of course losing the Golden Oak Library was hard for you too. [beat] I've got an idea. Why don't we have the girls add some things to make the castle feel more like your home as well?"
Spike,Really?
Twilight Sparkle,Hop on!
Twilight Sparkle,Ow! What are you doing?
Spike,"I, um... I just thought of what I want!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, okay. What is it?"
Spike,"It's a... well, I want a... it's... I kind of need a... a bed!"
Twilight Sparkle,I thought you said you sleep like a baby in the castle.
Spike,[scoffs] Everypony knows babies are terrible sleepers. Let's go!
Rarity,There! Now nothing is cluttering the castle!
Rainbow Dash,You're right. There is literally nothing cluttering this castle.
Fluttershy,What do we do now?
Rarity,"I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but it's almost sunset. If we don't figure this out soon, it's going to look like we didn't lift a hoof to help her!"
Rainbow Dash,Why is this so hard?! We're Twilight's best friends! This should be easy for us!
Applejack,"She said it herself <U+0096> if anypony should be able to make her feel comfortable in her new home, it's us. If we can't do it..."
Fluttershy,Then Twilight will be stuck living in a castle that makes her feel... sad!
Pinkie Pie,"Wow, Fluttershy! I didn't know you could be loud enough to echo!"
Applejack,"Calm down, Pinkie. We just need to figure out what we did wrong so we can make it right."
Rarity,"Well, I didn't do anything wrong! I did exactly what I would do if this were my home!"
Rainbow Dash,But it's not your home. It's Twilight's home!
Rarity,Where she keeps all her Rainbow Dash trophies?
Rainbow Dash,Touch<e9>.
Fluttershy,Maybe we're all a little guilty of making ourselves feel at home instead of Twilight.
Applejack,"Come on, y'all. We just need to think about Twilight. What was it she'd loved about livin' in the Golden Oak Library?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, everything! The books, the smell of books, the joy she felt from organizing books..."
Rainbow Dash,"Remember that time I crashed into all those books attempting my sonic rainboom after you guys just cleaned up? [laughs, sighs] That was good times."
Applejack,"Yeah, for you, maybe."
Rarity,"Oh, and Applejack, remember when we were stuck having a sleepover there? That turned out to be so much fun!"
Pinkie Pie,"Remember the time it got blown up to smithereens?! Wait, no, that was the worst."
Applejack,"We had a lot of good memories there, though. That's what made the Golden Oak Library home."
Rest of main cast sans Twilight,Yeah...
Applejack,[gasps] That's it!
Twilight Sparkle,How's that one? Too soft? Too hard? Too lumpy?
Spike,Um... Just right! I'll take it!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, thank goodness. I thought you'd never find one you liked! Let's find a salespony and get out of here."
Spike,"Sounds good to meee<U+0097>I... nn, um, uh, heh... did you hear that? [mimes squeaky springs] Too squeaky! Better keep looking!"
Applejack,[sighs] Maybe my plan won't work after all.
Rarity,"Of course it will, darling. I can see it! You and Fluttershy stay here. Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie, you come with me. We're going shopping! We'll meet back at the castle."
Applejack,It's not the things that ya gather 'round
Fluttershy,It's not how much you own
Rarity,The things that hold the meaning in your life Are the memories you've sown
All,"So we make, so we make, so we make This castle a home So we make, so we make This castle a home So we make, so we make This castle a home!"
Twilight Sparkle,Hello? We're home!
Rest of main cast,Welcome home!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I, uh... love what you've done with the place. You did such a good job of... preserving the integrity of the original design."
Spike,"Aw, come on! It looks exactly the same! Do you know how hard it was to keep her from coming back here?! I never want to see another dust ruffle as long as I live!"
Twilight Sparkle,Wait. Keep me from coming back here?
Rarity,[laughs nervously] It took a teensy bit longer than we thought.
Applejack,What really makes home feel like home isn't what it looks like. It's the memories you make when you're there.
Rarity,So we've made something that celebrates the memories we've made with you since you moved to Ponyville.
Fluttershy,The ornaments on the chandelier are reminders of all the fun we've had together.
Pinkie Pie,That one shows your party at the Golden Oak Library welcoming you to Ponyville!
Fluttershy,The time we shared donuts after the Grand Galloping Gala!
Rarity,We were hoping that being able to look at your beautiful old memories would inspire you to make new ones.
Applejack,"And the best part of it is, it's made from the roots of the Golden Oak Library, so you'll never forget where you came from."
Twilight Sparkle,It's exactly what the castle needed. And I am ready to make new memories here.
Pinkie Pie,Then let's start right now with a new memory cake! Seven layer what's-that-flavor mystery surprise! These might be chocolate chips or they might be super-spicy black beans!
Twilight Sparkle,"Let's go to the dining room. It's a little sparse, but [door opens] at least there's a table and chairs. Whoa! What happened in here? Last I checked, this place was empty!"
Rarity,I couldn't help myself! It was just begging for the personal touch!
Applejack,"Truth be told... I couldn't either. Your kitchen might have some rustic farm decor, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash,And there may or may not be some Daring Do posters up in your library.
Fluttershy,And some stuffed animals in your bedroom.
Twilight Sparkle,What was that?!
Applejack,[sighs] One of Pinkie Pie's confetti cannons.
Pinkie Pie,What? It's not my fault I hid them so well!
Applejack,"[simultaneously] Oh, Pinkie..."
Apple Bloom,"Hear ye, hear ye! This meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! Who wants to do roll-call?"
Scootaloo,I'm pretty sure we're all here.
Sweetie Belle,"Yeah. Apple Bloom, what's this all about?"
Apple Bloom,"Oh, nothin'... except this letter from Babs Seed sayin' she's got her cutie mark!"
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,What?!
Apple Bloom,She says it's a pair of scissors!
Scootaloo,So... she's good at cutting stuff?
Sweetie Belle,Of course! She was always fussing with her bangs and tail! I'll bet she grows up to be a celebrity stylist!
Apple Bloom,"But if she spends all her time cuttin' hair, who's gonna run the Manehattan CMCs?"
Scootaloo,"Well, not Babs. She can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if she's already got her cutie mark."
Apple Bloom,"Oh, wow. I guess you're right."
Sweetie Belle,"I'm glad she's happy, but I sure wouldn't want to be up to my flank in mane hair all day. Can you imagine getting stuck with a cutie mark you didn't like?"
Apple Bloom,No... or at least I hadn't...
Sweetie Belle,"Don't worry, Apple Bloom. Most of your family has apple-related cutie marks. I bet yours will be, too. And what's not to like about apples?"
Scootaloo,"There's the core, and sour apples, and rotten apples, and apples with worms in them<U+0097> What?"
Sweetie Belle,Not helping.
Apple Bloom,"I guess I just spent so much time worryin' about how to get a cutie mark, I never even thought about what would happen after. There's just so many things I never considered."
Applejack,"I'm sure there are, but you don't need to<U+0097>"
Apple Bloom,What if I finally get my cutie mark and I don't like it? What if I get my cutie mark and nopony likes me?
Applejack,"Well, that's just ridicu<U+0097>"
Apple Bloom,"What if the Crusaders drift apart? I mean, we won't really be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! [gasps] What if it's not an apple?! Will I have to move out?! Where will I live?!"
Applejack,"All right, that's enough, sugarcube. Those are way too many questions to answer all in one night."
Apple Bloom,But<U+0097>
Applejack,And nopony's gonna make ya move out.
Apple Bloom,"Are you sure, Applejack?"
Applejack,"Of course, I'm sure. Now get some sleep. You'll see. Everything will be better in the mornin'. Hush now, little sister You're loved by all you know You'll never lose their friendship No matter where you go"
Others,There ain't no call to worry So don't you cry or fret A cutie mark won't change you No matter what you get
Apple Bloom,[yawns] No matter what I get.
Apple Bloom,Hoo-ee! Nothin' like a good night's sleep!
Applejack,[muffled] Breakfast!
Apple Bloom,"You were right, Applejack! I feel much better! I don't know what I was so worried about last night!"
Applejack,"See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just about an<U+0097> Well, no wonder you were so worked up!"
Apple Bloom,What? What is it?
Applejack,Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!
Apple Bloom,[gasps] I can't believe it! I got my cutie mark! I got my cutie mark! [rumbling and echoing] I got my cutie mark! Wait 'til I tell the others that my cutie mark is a... a... What is it?
Applejack,I have no idea what it means.
Apple Bloom,Infestations? You mean like... parasprites?
Pest Control Pony,"Hah, please. Anypony with a trombone can get rid of parasprites. I'm talking about the serious stuff! You ever hear of... twittermites?"
Apple Bloom,Twittermites?
Pest Control Pony,Pest ponies like you and me are the only things keeping these live wires from destroying half of Equestria!
Apple Bloom,Pest ponies?
Pest Control Pony,"It's no easy trade! Even the best of us yearns for the day they can move on to greener pastures. Oh, now that you're here to take over, my day has finally come!"
Apple Bloom,Take over?
Pest Control Pony,You're gonna need to stop repeating what I say and pay attention if you want to learn anything.
Apple Bloom,I'm sorry. I guess this just wasn't what I was expectin'.
Pest Control Pony,Don't worry. With a cutie mark like that I'm sure you've got the touch.
Apple Bloom,"The touch? Oh, sorry."
Pest Control Pony,"Now, you're gonna need to be quick. Once these things get out, it can get pretty shocking."
Apple Bloom,"Wait, what do you mean?"
Apple Bloom,Ow!
Pest Control Pony,"Hah, told you! And the further apart they spread, the more powerful these jolts will get!"
Apple Bloom,What do I do?!
Pest Control Pony,"Call 'em back, of course."
Apple Bloom,Twittermites!
Apple Bloom,Bugbugbugbugbugbugbug!
Pest Control Pony,"Well, looks like you're all set. Drop me a note sometime at the Piney Shade Retirement Community."
Apple Bloom,"Now, hold on! I'm sure this job is real important, but... I don't think I wanna call bugs for the rest of my life. Hey, where'd he go?"
Diamond Tiara,"Well, well, well! Look at the new bug pony!"
Apple Bloom,It's pest pony.
Silver Spoon,"Eh, it sure is! Ew!"
Diamond Tiara,I might've known you'd end up with the worst cutie mark ever!
Silver Spoon,"But look on the bright side! Whenever you need a friend, you can just go out and catch one!"
Apple Bloom,That's not funny.
Diamond Tiara,"Heeere, friendfriendfriendfriendfrieeend!"
Apple Bloom,Stop it!
Apple Bloom,You know what? My cutie mark isn't the worst! You two are!
Apple Bloom,"[sighs] I hate to think that Diamond Tiara is right, but... this cutie mark sure isn't what I was hoping for."
Mysterious Voice,"Why should you have to keep it, then?"
Apple Bloom,Who's there?! What do you mean?!
Mysterious Voice,"If your cutie mark bothers you so much, get rid of it!"
Apple Bloom,"Well, if you know how to wave a hoof and erase a terrible cutie mark, you go right ahead!"
Mysterious Voice,As easily said as done.
Apple Bloom,Huh. Now that is some serious magic.
Apple Bloom,Hey! Where's everypony goin'?!
Apple Bloom,Mayor! What's goin' on?!
Mayor Mare,"Apple Bloom, you've got to get your family out of town!"
Apple Bloom,"Twittermites! Here, bugbugbugbugbugbug!"
Apple Bloom,"Here, bugs!"
Apple Bloom,"Come on, here!"
Applejack,Apple Bloom! What in tarnation are you doin'?!
Apple Bloom,"I'm tryin' to stop the infestation, of course!"
Applejack,Only a pest pony can do that! Now come on! We gotta skedaddle!
Apple Bloom,But I've gotta do somethin'!
Applejack,Are you crazy?!
Apple Bloom,Aaaaaaahhh!
Apple Bloom,Whoo-ee. That's what I call a nightmare. It seemed so real.
Applejack,[muffled] Breakfast!
Apple Bloom,Applejack! You are not gonna believe the dream I just had! I guess I needed more sleep than I thought!
Applejack,"See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just about<U+0097> [gasps] Well, no wonder you were so worked up!"
Apple Bloom,What?
Applejack,Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!
Apple Bloom,Again?! I mean... I did? Woo-hoo! Potion making! Now that's more like it!
Applejack,More like what?
Apple Bloom,Never mind. I'm just glad Princess Twilight's lessons finally paid off!
Applejack,"I expect you want to run off to the clubhouse and tell your friends all about your new cutie mark. But before you go, make sure you do all your... chores...?"
Apple Bloom,Whooo!
Scootaloo,Why all the excitement?
Sweetie Belle,"Yeah, what's going on?"
Apple Bloom,"[coyly] Oh, nothin'... except this brand new cutie mark!"
Scootaloo,That's amazing!
Sweetie Belle,Wow!
Apple Bloom,I know!
Scootaloo,That's so cool!
Apple Bloom,I don't suppose either of you got yours?
Scootaloo,Nope.
Sweetie Belle,Me neither...
Apple Bloom,"I know it's silly, but I'd always hoped we'd get our cutie marks together."
Scootaloo,Me too...
Sweetie Belle,But I'm still super excited for you!
Scootaloo,Absolutely!
Apple Bloom,I know! [knocks on podium] Let's call this meeting to order! I'm sure the three of us can figure out how to get two more cutie marks.
Sweetie Belle,"Um, yeah... the thing is..."
Apple Bloom,What?
Scootaloo,"Well, you can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if you've already got your cutie mark..."
Apple Bloom,"Oh, yeah... Just like Babs Seed... Well, I could just sit quietly in the corner 'til you two figure out what you're gonna do..."
Sweetie Belle,"Well, technically the clubhouse is for Crusaders only."
Apple Bloom,"Oh. Right. I guess I should just come back later, then...?"
Sweetie Belle,"Why? I mean, you can't come in then either."
Apple Bloom,Oh.
Sweetie Belle,Rules are rules.
Scootaloo,I don't even think we're still supposed to be friends.
Apple Bloom,What?!
Apple Bloom,"Sweetie Belle! Scootaloo! Come on, fillies, this isn't funny!"
Mysterious Voice,More trouble with cutie marks?
Apple Bloom,"No! I mean, w<U+0097> yeah, I mean... Well, I got mine, but my friends didn't get theirs, and now there's all kinds of trouble!"
Mysterious Voice,Sounds to me like cutie marks and trouble are two peas in the same pod.
Apple Bloom,"I guess so... I mean, if I was a blank flank again, there wouldn't be a problem!"
Mysterious Voice,Your wish is my command.
Scootaloo,"Hey, Apple Bloom. Why'd you want to meet here?"
Apple Bloom,"Well, us blank flanks have to meet somewhere!"
Scootaloo,"Um, actually, Apple Bloom, we... both sort of got our cutie marks."
Apple Bloom,You did?! What are they?
Scootaloo,"Oh, we don't have time to go into all that."
Sweetie Belle,And we certainly don't have time to hang out at an old clubhouse.
Scootaloo,"Yeah, we've got responsibilities now."
Sweetie Belle,But maybe we'll see you later.
Scootaloo,Much later.
Apple Bloom,"Wait! Hold on! I can get my cutie mark back, I think! Rrgh! I mean, I got it once, right? Oh, just wait a second! Nooooooooooo!"
Apple Bloom,What in Equestria's goin' on?!
Applejack,[muffled] Breakfast!
Apple Bloom,I'm not so sure sleep is the cure-all Applejack thinks it is.
Apple Bloom,"Uh... Applejack? I know you said sleep is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm pretty sure it's makin' me feel worse."
Applejack,"See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix<U+0097> Well, no wonder you were so worked up..."
Apple Bloom,Wh<U+0097> Didn't you hear what I said?! I was trying to<U+0097>
Granny Smith,"Weeeell, what do we have here?"
Apple Bloom,"What is it, Granny? What's wrong?!"
Granny Smith,"Oh, nothin', right, Applejack?"
Applejack,"Right... Nothin' at all... Right, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh,"Truth is, Apple Bloom, it's your cutie mark."
Applejack,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"Oh, no! What is it now?!"
Big McIntosh,"[echoing] Well, I can tell you what it ain't. It ain't no apple."
Granny Smith,Nnope!
Apple Bloom,What?!
Applejack,[in Big McIntosh's voice] And we don't have room for non-apples.
Big McIntosh,[in Applejack's voice] Nnope.
Granny Smith,[in Big McIntosh's voice] Time for you to mosey on. You can't stay here.
Apple Bloom,But this is my home!
Big McIntosh,"Oh, and you're gonna have to change your name."
Granny Smith,Eeyup!
Big McIntosh,"I think just 'Bloom' has a nice ring to it, don't you, Applejack?"
Applejack,Eeyup!
Apple Bloom,Noooooooooo!
Apple Bloom,Ugh!
Apple Bloom,"Alright, this is getting ridiculous. [pause] Whoo-ee! I never thought I'd be so happy to not get a cutie mark. What the?!"
Apple Bloom,[frustrated grunt] I don't wanna see another cutie mark as long as I live!
Mysterious Voice,Back so soon?
Apple Bloom,"All right, whoever you are! I dunno what spell you went and cast on me, but I want it to stop right now!"
Mysterious Voice,"I didn't cast a spell, on you or anypony else. I only did what you wanted."
Apple Bloom,Rrrgh! Why would I want you to torment me with nightmares?!
Mysterious Voice,"You didn't want to catch bugs, and I helped. You didn't want to lose friends, and I helped. If there's a problem with your family, I'm sure I can help with that too."
Apple Bloom,I don't want your help! Just get away from me!
Princess Luna,"Oh, Apple Bloom, you can't get away from your own shadow."
Apple Bloom,Princess Luna?! My shadow? What do you mean? It's just me? You mean I've been doin' all this to myself?
Princess Luna,"Of course, Apple Bloom. It's your dream."
Apple Bloom,"If I've been dreamin' this whole time, why don't I just wake up?"
Princess Luna,"Sometimes we can worry about a thing so much, the fear can make us feel we're trapped in a nightmare. I don't suppose there's anything you're particularly afraid of, is there?"
Apple Bloom,Yeah... I guess I've been pretty worried about gettin' my cutie mark.
Apple Bloom,"But if I like who I am, do you think other ponies will too?"
Princess Luna,Of course.
Apple Bloom,Then it doesn't matter what my cutie mark is!
Princess Luna,Indeed.
Apple Bloom,But that's so simple! I must be the only pony in the universe this worried about her cutie mark.
Princess Luna,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
Apple Bloom,Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle are havin' nightmares too?
Princess Luna,"It's been a busy night for us all, but I think it's time to bring it to a close."
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,Princess Luna!
Princess Luna,"I know you've all had a lot on your minds tonight, but I think Apple Bloom has something she'd like to share before you wake."
Sweetie Belle,We're still asleep?
Scootaloo,Cool!
Apple Bloom,"Well, I guess I should call this dream meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to order!"
Apple Bloom,"I know we all got pretty anxious when we found out Babs got her cutie mark, but I for one don't want to have nightmares every night from now until we get ours!"
Scootaloo,Me neither!
Apple Bloom,"And even though we're all a little scared, a cutie mark won't change who we are or how everypony feels about us!"
Sweetie Belle,It's lucky we're all scared of the same things. That way we can help and remind each other to just be who we are!
Princess Luna,"And when the day comes that you all finally get your cutie marks, you can be sure they'll fit you to a T."
Apple Bloom,Exactly!
Scootaloo,Do you fillies think that Babs is worried or scared about some of this stuff?
Apple Bloom,I know! Let's put together a care package for her!
Sweetie Belle,That way she'll know she isn't alone!
Apple Bloom,"We wouldn't want her to think that just because she isn't a Crusader, we can't still be friends! But, uh... maybe we should wait 'til we wake up."
Princess Luna,Good idea.
Applejack,There ain't no call to worry So don't you cry or fret
Apple Bloom,A cutie mark won't change me No matter what I get
Applejack,"Well, sure looks like somepony's feelin' better."
Apple Bloom,You have no idea.
Applejack,"See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep cures just about everythin'."
Apple Bloom,I guess so. I just wish it hadn't been so exhaustin'.
Rainbow Dash,"Look at that, Tank! Cloudsdale's here! That means Ponyville is next up for winter!"
Rainbow Dash,"You're doing awesome, everypony! Keep it up! We need those leaves off those trees! Once we get autumn cleared away, it'll be hello, winter!"
Rainbow Dash,Was that a yawn I just saw?
Rainbow Dash,"How can you be tired when the most exciting time of the year is right around the corner? And don't forget the best part <U+0096> our first winter together! Come on, wake up! Once those ponies bring in the big, fat clouds full of snowflakes, we'll have a ton of snow for our extreme sledding! [cheering] And over there, we can play horse hockey, with no shoulder or arm pads!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Everything's looking great, don't you think?"
Rainbow Dash,Almost everything. Does Tank look alright to you?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, he does seem to be moving a little slowly."
Rainbow Dash,"I know, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,And he looks kind of sleepy...
Rainbow Dash,Totally!
Twilight Sparkle,...just like he always does.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, ha ha, I'm sure you're right."
Rainbow Dash,Well?!
Fluttershy,I suppose his heartbeat could be a teensy-weensy-eensy bit slower than usual...
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, so give him a vitamin or something!"
Fluttershy,I don't think he needs that.
Rainbow Dash,"Maybe we're just staying up too late. Uh, too many Daring Do stories."
Fluttershy,"Oh, that's not it either."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, what's wrong with him then?!"
Fluttershy,Nothing! He's perfectly fine.
Fluttershy,He's just going to hibernate.
Rainbow Dash,"You do realize he's not a bear, right?"
Fluttershy,"[giggles] When the weather grows cold and less food is available, many animals hibernate to conserve energy. It's like taking a really long nap during winter, and then they wake up in spring. And see? Even tortoises do it! When the time comes, Tank will leave and dig into the ground."
Fluttershy,But don't worry. He'll reappear when the spring sun warms the ground back up.
Rainbow Dash,Come on! Tortoises don't hibernate! Somepony put that picture in there as a joke.
Fluttershy,It's not a joke.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, then your book must be wrong!"
Fluttershy,"Rainbow Dash, Tank needs to hibernate. It's healthy for him, just like sleeping is healthy for us."
Rainbow Dash,"[short laugh] Whatever. Okay, thanks. Come on, Tank."
Fluttershy,Where are you going?
Rainbow Dash,To get a second opinion from a real reptile expert.
Spike,"I told you, Rainbow Dash, I'm a dragon!"
Rainbow Dash,Come on! You're practically twins!
Spike,I'm purple.
Rainbow Dash,"But if you don't have to hibernate, why should Tank?!"
Spike,Because he's a tortoise and I'm a dragon!
Rainbow Dash,"Same family though, right?"
Spike,No!
Rainbow Dash,I'll take that as a yes.
Spike,"Ugh! Look, if Fluttershy says tortoises hibernate, then I guarantee tortoises hiber<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, what would you know?! You're a dragon!"
Rainbow Dash,"Nopony knows you like I do, Tank. All you need is some hard work to get the old blood pumping."
Rainbow Dash,Come on!
Rainbow Dash,"[huff] These things are heavy! Chock full of snowflakes! We're gonna have such a killer time in the snow, Tank. Tank? Tank!"
Pinkie Pie,"Aww, look at the cute wittle Tankie, all snuggly-wuggly, getting ready to hibern<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,Don't say that word!
Pinkie Pie,"Which one? ""Snuggly""? ""Wuggly""? ""Tankie""? ""Hibernate""?"
Rainbow Dash,That one!
Pinkie Pie,I was just saying how cute he<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"If you think hiber... <U+0096> you know, that napping thing <U+0096> is so cute, why don't you go do it?! Somewhere far away from here?!"
Rainbow Dash,[to rest of Mane Six] What are you looking at?! Pinkie Pie and I are just having a conversation!
Twilight Sparkle,"Look, Rainbow Dash, we all know how upset you are about Tank hiber<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,Shhhh! Don't say that word! That's what started this all!
Twilight Sparkle,We all know how upset you are about Tank. But you shouldn't take your anger out on your friends.
Rainbow Dash,"Who said anything about anger?! I didn't say anything about anger! I'm not upset! And I am not angry! Do I look angry?! [grumbles] Come on, Tank! Let's get out of here!"
Rainbow Dash,"I need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, not sleepy-eyed and scaly-tailed! Which... is exactly what you are. But get up anyway!"
Rainbow Dash,"You can't hiber<U+0096> you know. What about all the primo things we're gonna do together this winter? Building snow ponies, starting snowball fights, sipping hot cider by the fire."
Rainbow Dash,"Don't you wanna do those things with me?! Think, Rainbow Dash, think! Tank's only hibernating because it's cold, right? Well, I'd rather have him awake in the heat than asleep in the cold... [gasps] I just have to stop winter!"
Sunshower,So where do these clouds go?
Open Skies,Over by Clear Skies.
Sunshower,But there's clear skies everywhere.
Clear Skies,"Yo, Clear Skies right here!"
Sunshower,"But there's clear skies over there, too!"
Clear Skies,That's Open Skies!
Sunshower,There's open skies everywhere!
Open Skies,I'm not everywhere. I'm right here!
Sunshower,"[sighs] Wait. So you're Open Skies, and you're Clear Skies. Then what's all that?"
Clear Skies and Open Skies,"Open, clear skies!"
Open Skies,"Hey, where'd our fluffy clouds go?"
Clear Skies,Fluffy Clouds? He's over there!
Rainbow Dash,Hah! Stopping winter is gonna be a breeze!
Rainbow Dash,When life gives you lemons You can make lemonade But life gave me Tank here And my choice has long been made
Others,No winter will come to Ponyville I'll do it on my own I will keep you by my side So I will not be alone
Others,"And I'll fly, and I'll fly Until the end of the sky So I'll be the one who doesn't Have to say goodbye"
Others,I'll clear the skies forever So we won't be apart I'll keep the weather warm for you And the winter will never start
Others,"Weather-makers Pegasi You make the seasons in the sky I don't want to sabotage you But you see, I've got to try"
Others,"No winter can come here now I'll keep the warmth and the sun somehow I'm sorry, ponies, this has to be For I need my friend and he needs me"
Others,"I know it's wrong, but what does it matter? 'Cause nothing's gonna stop me now I'll change it all, it's only the weather And nopony's gonna bring me down"
Others,I'll keep the sunlight shining free And I'll bust the clouds apart so you can stay with me
Others,"And I'll fly, and I'll fly Until the end of the sky So I'll be the one who doesn't Have to say goodbye"
Others,I'll clear the skies forever So we won't be apart I'll keep the weather warm for you And the winter will never start!
Sunshower,Here comes the next shipment! Move those clouds over!
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh! For every hoof step back, they go three hoof steps forward! What are we gonna do? [long pause] Cloudsdale. That's it, Tank! If I can't stop winter in Ponyville, maybe I can stop it at the source!"
Rainbow Dash,Lunch hour! Perfect!
Rainbow Dash,"Slam dunk! With no water, they can't make clouds or snow! They can't make winter!"
Rainbow Dash,"I hate to do this to those weather ponies, but desperate times call for desperate measures!"
Rainbow Dash,Oopsies! Looks like these were a little loose!
Rainbow Dash,And there goes winter down the drain!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, I can't see!"
Rainbow Dash,Aaaaaah!
Rainbow Dash,Let's get out of here!
Applejack,What in the name of Celestia's goin' on up there?
Twilight Sparkle,"Prepare yourselves, everypony! Winter is coming!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Everypony, look out!"
Rainbow Dash,"[groaning] You okay, Tank?"
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash! Are you alright?
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] No...
Pinkie Pie,"Knock, knock!"
Fluttershy,"How are you feeling, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,[despondently] Whatever...
Rarity,The poor thing looks so sad! Just what are we doing to do?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know what we can do.
Applejack,"Buck up, Sugarcube. You just ain't yourself these days."
Rainbow Dash,[despondently] Whatever...
Rarity,"Uh, how can I say this tactfully...? You've lost your sparkle, Rainbow Dash."
Pinkie Pie,"I hate to say this, but, well... you've become...! [hushed] A party pooper!"
Rainbow Dash,"Didn't you hear me? I said 'whatever'. I don't know if you're here to cheer me up or what, but I'm fine."
Fluttershy,"Let me handle this. Rainbow Dash, your winter is going to be pet-less."
Rarity,Whatever did you do that for?!
Fluttershy,Because she'll never get past this until she lets it all out.
Applejack,[awkwardly] Uh... it's okay. Tank'll come back in a few months.
Applejack,"Alright, alright. There, there. [hushed, to Fluttershy] Nice going, Fluttershy. How do we get her to stop?"
Fluttershy,[hushed] She's got to be about done by now. Can't be too much left in there.
Fluttershy,Feeling better?
Rarity,[starts crying] I can't bear to see Fluttershy cry!
Pinkie Pie,[starts crying] It's just heart-wrenching!
Twilight Sparkle,[to Applejack] You too?!
Applejack,"Nope, I'm good."
Twilight Sparkle,"Look, everypony, I know how hard it is to say goodbye<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,[crying] I'm mostly sad because you're not sad!
Twilight Sparkle,What?! Me?! What about Applejack?
Pinkie Pie,"[crying] Applejack cries on the inside, Twilight!"
Applejack,It's true.
Rainbow Dash,"[settling down] It's alright, Fluttershy. It's alright."
Applejack,[hushed] You think she's done or just getting a third wind?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know... Rainbow Dash? Are you okay?
Rainbow Dash,"[sniffling] I think so. I feel better. Really, I do. Thanks, everypony. I don't know what I'd do without you. [tearing up] Or him... [sniffs] Oh, Tank... I'm sure gonna miss you."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, guess we're starting winter with a bang."
Applejack,The fun's come early! Yee-haw!
Pinkie Pie,You think we could mess up winter every year? It's way less work!
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, I don't think Rainbow Dash could handle it."
Rainbow Dash,Riding that entire season from Cloudsdale to Ponyville was pretty awesome.
Rainbow Dash,I thought you guys might like to say goodbye to Tank. He's ready to hibernate.
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, you're using the word! Oh, she's using the word! And when Tank finishes hibernating, I'm gonna throw him the biggest welcome home party ever! Or wait. Should it be a 'welcome above ground' party? Or a 'happy wake-up' party? Maybe an 'it's about time!' party!"
Rarity,"And I'll design him a very special suit just for the occasion, whichever one it ends up being."
Applejack,"I'm glad you're feelin' a little better, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, me too."
Rainbow Dash,"So, you really wanna do this hibernating thing, huh?"
Rarity,"Goodbye, Tank."
Fluttershy,Happy winter.
Applejack,"See you later, little feller."
Pinkie Pie,"Have a good sleep, Tank!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Goodbye, Tank! We'll miss you!"
Twilight Sparkle,Well? Ready for some winter fun?
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, I'm gonna hang here and read to him a bit. That little guy can never get to sleep without a bedtime story. I'll be right there."
Apple Bloom,Aren't you glad y'all came with me to see Applejack compete in the Appleloosa rodeo?
Scootaloo,Totally! This place is a cutie mark gold mine! There's barrel racing...
Scootaloo,"...roping contests, rodeo clowning..."
Scootaloo,...steeplechase...!
Apple Bloom,"If we can get into some of these events, we could all three walk off the train back in Ponyville with brand spankin' new cutie marks!"
Scootaloo,Wouldn't a barrel look good here?
Apple Bloom,I want a lasso!
Sweetie Belle,"I don't know... All these events look a little, well, dangerous."
Apple Bloom,"No risk, no reward."
Sheriff Silverstar,"Alright, everypony, listen up! We need a big presence at this here rodeo, so make yourself plenty seen! I want that low-down varmint to know we mean business!"
Sweetie Belle,I hope nothing bad is going on.
Apple Bloom,A cutie mark-apalooza and a low-down varmint? This is shapin' up to be the most excitin' rodeo ever!
Scootaloo,"Yeah, come on!"
Braeburn,"Woo-hoo! Yee-haw! That's my cousin! Go, Applejack, go!"
Applejack,Whew! It's been a dog's age since I got to compete. All the rodeos 'round Ponyville are closed down for some reason.
Braeburn,"Well, I guess havin' injured kinfolk in Appleloosa sure paid off then, huh, cuz?"
Applejack,"Just doin' my best to fill your horseshoes, Braeburn."
Braeburn,Keep tossin' like that and I'll be out of a job!
Braeburn,"Ow, ow!"
Applejack,"Ooh, sorry. Say, where's my sister and her friends?"
Braeburn,"Uh-oh. Gee, uh, I guess I got so caught up watchin' you that I<U+0097>"
Applejack,You said you'd keep an eye on those fillies! How am I supposed to focus on practicin' if you're not gonna<U+0097>
Braeburn,"There they are! Heh, right where I left 'em... Aw, don't be mad! [beat] Owwwwch! My foreleg! Hurts so much...!"
Applejack,"Y'all can't go runnin' off like that, y'hear? Backstage at a rodeo ain't no kind of playground!"
Apple Bloom,"Sorry, Applejack. We won't wander off again. But, uh, speakin' of the rodeo... what would you say about me and the Crusaders maybe competin' in one teensy-weensy little event or three?"
Braeburn,Look out!
Applejack,[gasps] What the hay just happened?
Braeburn,You fillies alright?
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,Uh-huh...
Sweetie Belle,[simultaneously] Yeah...
Sheriff Silverstar,"Sugar and salt licks! Well, I'll be..."
Applejack,"What is it, Sheriff?"
Braeburn,Is it him?
Sheriff Silverstar,Ain't no doubt. It's Trouble Shoes.
Townspony 1,Is it true? Is Trouble Shoes here?
Townspony 2,"You ain't gonna shut down the rodeo, are ya?!"
Sheriff Silverstar,"All right now, I called for a meetin', not a mob scene. Now, as many of you know, the Equestria rodeo circuit has been plagued by the dirty dealin's of a notorious outlaw."
Townspony 3,He knocked barrels every which way at the Hoof City rodeo! Nearly crushed my Aunt Bae Mare!
Townspony 4,"That's nothin'! He sabotaged the steer pen at Pinto Creek rodeo, settin' off such a stampede they cancelled the whole dadgum thing!"
Sheriff Silverstar,"Now, now, it's true we had an incident this mornin' at our own Appleloosa rodeo. Hay bale stack came down right near on top of three little fillies! I examined them hoof-prints myself and, uh... it was Trouble Shoes, all right."
Sheriff Silverstar,"I reckon I oughta cancel this rodeo like all the others done. But dag-hoof it, this has gone far enough! We'll double the patrols! This rodeo will go on! Appleloosa ain't gonna be intimidated!"
Apple Bloom,Don't send us home! It's not fair!
Applejack,"Now, quit yer bellyachin'. I can't have y'all around here with some outlaw on the loose. Aw, maybe I oughta call it quits and go home too."
Braeburn,"No, you can't! This rodeo is important to Appleloosa! And with you in there, we got a real shot at winnin'! Come on, now, you head on back to practice and don't worry none about these three. I won't let 'em outta my sight."
Braeburn,[to Crusaders] Ya hear? Y'all ain't leavin' my sight!
Sweetie Belle,I thought we weren't going to wander off again.
Apple Bloom,This ain't wanderin'. We know exactly where we're headed <U+0096> to find Trouble Shoes!
Sweetie Belle,But isn't he a dangerous criminal?
Apple Bloom,We only need to find him. We don't need to capture him. The sheriff can handle that!
Scootaloo,"And once he's in jail, we'll be competing! And then it's..."
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,Cutie mark city!
Sweetie Belle,Worst idea ever.
Apple Bloom,It's another giant hoof print!
Sweetie Belle,Do either of you have any idea where we are?
Scootaloo,"Uh, maybe we should head back and try again later."
Apple Bloom,"C'mon, before we lose the trail!"
Sweetie Belle,"Come on, we've gone far enough! It's time to go back!"
Scootaloo,"The rain is only getting worse, Apple Bloom! Let's come back tomorrow."
Apple Bloom,"Maybe y'all are right. So, how do we get back?"
Sweetie Belle,You mean you don't know?!
Applejack,"Whew! Good job, y'all. I know they need lots of mud for the rodeo tomorrow, but I wish they would've warned us about this rainstorm."
Applejack,Braeburn? Where are the girls?
Applejack,[echoing] What?!
Sheriff Silverstar,Ha! Fish my wish!
Star Spur,Aw!
Senior Deputy,Dagnabbit!
Applejack,Sheriff Silverstar! You gotta help! My sister's gone! And her friends too!
Braeburn,"I've searched and searched, but no sign of 'em anywhere!"
Applejack,It must've been Trouble Shoes!
Sheriff Silverstar,"Now, now, hold on there. Trouble Shoes done a lot of bad things in his day, but nothin' like that!"
Applejack,You really wanna take that chance?
Sheriff Silverstar,"Come on, y'all! Let's ride!"
Sweetie Belle,"You sure about this, Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo,"I thought I was, but now I'm not."
Apple Bloom,So I pretty much got us completely and totally lost. How could this get any worse?
Apple Bloom,We gotta get out of this rain. There's no tellin' how long this storm could last.
Scootaloo,Look!
Apple Bloom,It looks abandoned. Let's go see if we can find some blankets or somethin'.
Apple Bloom,[through tinnitus] Hello? You alright?
Trouble Shoes,Surely.
Apple Bloom,We didn't mean no harm. We just came in to get out of the rain.
Trouble Shoes,Had some hot cider a-cookin' in the kitchen. Doubt it survived.
Trouble Shoes,"I ain't gonna rise to greet y'all. Awfully rude, I reckon, but as you can see, I'm the fresh casualty of an unusually unfortunate circumstance. My lot in life, I suppose."
Apple Bloom,Are you... Trouble Shoes?
Trouble Shoes,That's me.
Scootaloo,W-what are you doing?
Apple Bloom,I'm gonna unwrap him.
Sweetie Belle,You can't do that! That's Trouble Shoes!
Apple Bloom,"Aw, he don't seem so bad."
Trouble Shoes,Of course guests would arrive while I ain't got no pie to offer. Scores more misfortune points for old Trouble Shoes. Wh-whooaaa!
Trouble Shoes,Typical. Bad luck never rests.
Apple Bloom,"You sure that's bad luck? Seems like maybe you're just a little, um..."
Sweetie Belle,Klutzy?
Trouble Shoes,Tell that to the flank! Upside-down horseshoe <U+0096> bad luck. Follows me wherever I go like sour on old milk. Y'all best vamoose before my bad luck rubs off and sticks to y'all. Get along! Skedaddle!
Trouble Shoes,Am-scray!
Scootaloo,"Um, we don't really know the way back to Appleloosa..."
Trouble Shoes,But o' course I do. Wouldn't you know it? My lucky day.
Sweetie Belle,It's actually kind of sweet of him to help us out like this.
Scootaloo,"I know! What do we do if he takes us back to Appleloosa and the sheriff arrests him? If I get a cutie mark for that, I'll feel guilty every time I see it."
Apple Bloom,"Say there, Trouble Shoes, you might not want to take us all the way back to Appleloosa. The sheriff sort of has it in his mind that you're a no-good outlaw lookin' to shut down the rodeo."
Trouble Shoes,My kind of luck he'd think that.
Apple Bloom,But... is it true?
Trouble Shoes,Y'all like stories?
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Mm-hmm!
Trouble Shoes,"Just my luck. I was hopin' you'd say no. [narrating flashback] When I was a colt, I wanted to be a rodeo star somethin' fierce, but I just didn't seem to have the knack for it."
Young Trouble Shoes,Whoooa!
Young Trouble Shoes,[grunting] Awww!
Trouble Shoes,[narrating] I practiced and practiced...
Young Trouble Shoes,Whoooa-oof!
Trouble Shoes,"[narrating] And finally, I wrangled up the guts to audition for rodeo school. Right in the middle of that tryout, I knew I was doin' what I was meant to. And wouldn't you know it? In a flash comes this here cutie mark."
Trouble Shoes,"[narrating] I can still remember them judges a-laughin'. Didn't even finish my routine 'cause right then I knew bad luck was my fate. That fire for rodeo never did leave me, though. Couldn't keep away from 'em. So I'd sneak down and have a look, and wouldn't you know it? Bad luck would strike again. Just my lot in life, I reckon..."
Sweetie Belle,Poor Trouble Shoes. I can't believe those mean judges would laugh at him like that.
Apple Bloom,Don't you see? They weren't laughin' at him. They were just enjoyin' the show.
Scootaloo,What are you saying?
Apple Bloom,"Think about it. If we saw a rodeo clown doin' what he did back in that shack, we'd think he was the greatest!"
Sweetie Belle,"You're right! He could still be in rodeos, just not the way he thought!"
Scootaloo,"So he's been looking at his cutie mark wrong the whole time! It's not bad luck, it's<U+0097>"
Sheriff Silverstar,Gotcha!
Trouble Shoes,Just my luck.
Sheriff Silverstar,"Trouble Shoes, you're under arrest for vandalizin' the property and peace of mind of the good rodeo-lovin' ponies of Equestria! Not to mention fillynappin'! And... generalized mayhem!"
Apple Bloom,Wait!
Applejack,Braeburn? Get these fillies someplace safe.
Apple Bloom,"Wait, no! Listen, Applejack!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,No!
Apple Bloom,But Trouble Shoes isn't the menace everypony thinks!
Applejack,"Sakes alive, what's with you? Why in tarnation would you want me to help get him out of jail when he's the one who ran off with y'all to begin with?! Now if y'all excuse me, I'm off to win the Appleloosa rodeo hay bale monster stack."
Apple Bloom,"Um, Applejack?"
Trouble Shoes,"[sighs] Well, at least I get me a view of one small corner of the rodeo."
Trouble Shoes,Figures.
Sheriff Silverstar,"Aw, come on now, Trouble Shoes! I'm runnin' out of mattresses!"
Apple Bloom,"Come on, sheriff! You're about to miss the hay bale monster stack!"
Sheriff Silverstar,"Jiminy, that's startin' already?!"
Apple Bloom,"Let's go, Trouble Shoes! This here's a jailbreak!"
Trouble Shoes,Ain't no need. Can hear the rodeo just fine from this vantage.
Scootaloo,But we've got a plan to help you live your dream!
Trouble Shoes,"Listen, y'all, I'm a known criminal. How you proposin' on gettin' me into a rodeo?"
Apple Bloom,"Go, Applejack!"
Scootaloo,[simultaneously] You can do it!
Sweetie Belle,[simultaneously] Woo-hoo!
Trouble Shoes,"Well, how do I look?"
Trouble Shoes,"Come on now, stack them bales! Woo-hoo!"
Apple Bloom,That's my sister!
Apple Bloom,"'Kay now, Trouble Shoes, you're on!"
Trouble Shoes,"Say what?! I may be dressed like one, but I ain't no rodeo clown."
Apple Bloom,"You got your cutie mark all wrong, Trouble Shoes! You were born to entertain! You've got a gift for makin' folks laugh, don't you?"
Trouble Shoes,"But my cutie mark's an upside-down horseshoe, and that means bad luck."
Sweetie Belle,That all depends on how you look at it.
Apple Bloom,"You always wanted to be a part of the rodeo, right? Well, now's your chance. Go on!"
Trouble Shoes,Whoa!
Applejack,"There y'all are! How 'bout your big sis, huh?"
Apple Bloom,"[flatly] Yeah, way to go."
Applejack,Since when are y'all so into rodeo clowns?
Trouble Shoes,"Just leave me be, cutie mark! I aim to clear that there hoop!"
Crowd,Trouble Shoes!
Applejack,What the hay?!
Others,Female Townspony # He escaped from jail!
Others,Male Townspony # Ruinin' another rodeo!
Others,Female Townspony # Let's get him!
Apple Bloom,"Wait, y'all! He ain't what you think he is!"
Sheriff Silverstar,"Stand aside, young'uns! This one's goin' back to jail."
Sweetie Belle,But he never wanted to ruin any rodeos! Those were just bad accidents!
Applejack,"Sweetie Belle, what are you talkin' about?"
Scootaloo,Trouble Shoes has a gift for making ponies laugh! He's maybe the best rodeo clown I've ever seen!
Judge,That's true! He is awful funny.
Apple Bloom,"He thought his cutie mark was telling him to keep away from rodeos, but deep inside he knew it's where he was meant to be. He just didn't know how to do it."
Trouble Shoes,"What she says is true. This here entertainin' y'all with my klutzin'? That's what I was supposed to be doin'. I know it now. I didn't mean no harm, honest! I just ain't never loved nothin' like I love the rodeo, so I kept on sneakin' back and makin' a big old mess of things. Turns out I was just a-lookin' at my cutie mark all wrong."
Sheriff Silverstar,"That may be so, Trouble Shoes, but you still gotta face charges for the problems you've caused!"
Trouble Shoes,"If I done wrong, I'll see to it that I take my medicine and square my accounts."
Sheriff Silverstar,"Truth be told, we could understand all the trouble with the rodeos, but why'd you have to run off with these here little'uns last night?"
Apple Bloom,"Uh, yeah, about that..."
Apple Bloom,[sighs] You really want us to clean up all this mess Trouble Shoes made?
Applejack,Maybe it'll teach you not to go wanderin' off after I say not to!
Apple Bloom,"Ugh. Ain't it bad enough that you get to go back to Ponyville with a shiny trophy, and all we're bringing back is these same old blank flanks?"
Applejack,Y'all helped Trouble Shoes realize what his cutie mark really means. Ain't that a nice feelin' you can take back with you?
Sweetie Belle,I guess we did make things a little better.
Scootaloo,It does feel kinda nice.
Apple Bloom,So... we can stop now?
Applejack,Nnope.
Discord,"Ohoho, but that's not all! When I went to look for them again, they were on the ceiling!"
Fluttershy,"[laughs] Oh, Discord, I've never known anypony as funny as you! I love that story about the time you tried to train your right paw... [giggles] ...to fetch your left leg! [giggles] Oh, I do love our Tuesday teas, and I can't wait for you to meet my friend Tree Hugger. She's going to love you too."
Fluttershy,I met her on a trip to see the Breezies. She's a member of the Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures.
Fluttershy,We're all gonna have so much fun together at the Grand Galloping Gala!
Discord,"Oh, I was wondering when you were going to ask me. I'd love to."
Fluttershy,"Oh. Oh, no. Um, I'm afraid I've already asked Tree Hugger. I'm sorry, Discord. I assumed you'd have your own ticket since you and Princess Celestia are friends now. Were you not invited?"
Discord,"Who, me? It probably got lost in the mail. No biggie, as the foals say. Well, gotta go!"
Fluttershy,But we haven't had any of our Tuesday teacakes.
Discord,"Well, I guess we're just going to have to exclude them from our party this time. Oh, did I say that out loud? I mean, ta-ta."
Spike,[snoring] Gemstones... [snoring] Gah!
Discord,Where's Twilight?
Spike,"Uh, she's in Canterlot, helping Princess Celestia with the Gala!"
Rarity,"Oh, your first Grand Galloping Gala! The excitement, the anticipation! I wouldn't miss this for all the jewels in Equestria!"
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,[singsong] We're going to the Gala! We're going to the Gala! We're going to the Gala!
Rainbow Dash,Hey!
Discord,"I don't suppose that, uh, these adorable little cutie pies have their own tickets to the Gross Gruesome Gala, do they?"
Rarity,"Ahem! To answer your rather rude question, they're going as our dates, our plus-ones."
Sweetie Belle,[singsong] We're plus-ones!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,[singsong] We're plus ones! We're plus-ones!
Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, I believe I got that!"
Rainbow Dash,Yeah!
Pinkie Pie,"Have a wonderful, special, fantastic day! Oh, hi, Discord. Want some cake?"
Pinkie Pie,"I can give you a list of all the flavors we have in order of most delicious to incredibly, unbelievably delicious!"
Discord,"Actually, Pinkie Pie, who are you taking to... I mean, do you... eugh, oh, you know what? I am famished. I'll take all the cakes."
Pinkie Pie,All of them?! He wants all of the cakes!
Discord,"Well, I'll need all my energy when I'm dancing at the Gala, if I decide to go that is. Oh, by the way, are you bringing anypony?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, of course! I was gonna ask my mom, because she's, you know, my mom, but it turned out she didn't want to go, so I started asking around and around and around, and I couldn't think of anypony, and I was about to just go by myself, and I realized, of course! Who loves fancy exciting affairs more than anypony else? My sister Maud!"
Discord,You know what? Cancel my order.
Pinkie Pie,You want none of the cakes now?!
Fluttershy,"[laughing] Oh, my, you are funny!"
Discord,I guess every being in Equestria is funny today.
Fluttershy,"Oh, how rude of me. Tree Hugger, this is Discord. Discord, Tree Hugger."
Tree Hugger,Radical to meet you. Really digging your vibe.
Discord,My vibe?
Fluttershy,It's a compliment.
Discord,"Oh, well, I'm sure it is. Well, I must be off."
Discord,Have fun at the Gala!
Tree Hugger,Righteous!
Discord,"""Oh, Tree Hugger. You're such a great friend. So much funnier than unfunny old Discord!"""
Discord,"""No, no, here. Take my plus-one. I insist. Before somepony else thinks he's my friend and expects to be asked instead. What's that? You're worried Discord might be upset?"" Not a problem! I can make more new friends anytime I want. It's not as if any of this actually mattered! I don't even want to go to the Gala anyway!"
Discord,Are you perhaps looking for me?
Parcel Post,"Are you ""Discord or current resident""? I can't find any street numbers in this place."
Discord,My ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala! I was invited after all!
Discord,[grimly] Why is this so late?
Parcel Post,"Well, I got a little lost after I escaped the flying badgers... Can you point me in the direction of the bottomless pit? I think I can make my way back from there."
Princess Celestia,"I must say, it's been very nice having you take over some of the planning responsibilities for this year's Gala."
Twilight Sparkle,Anything I can do to make it easier on you.
Princess Celestia,"Thank you, Twilight. I am quite looking forward to just enjoying the Gala for once."
Announcer,"Announcing the spirit of chaos, Discord, and his guest, the, uh..."
Announcer,The Smooze!
Discord,"Good evening, everypony! What a glorious affair!"
Discord,"He does have a yen for shiny things, the rascal."
Twilight Sparkle,I'll take care of this.
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] What are you doing here with... that?!
Discord,"Now, now, now. The Smooze may be an ""it"", but it's an it with a heart of, well, blob."
Twilight Sparkle,"This night is extremely important to me, Discord. [through gritted teeth] Keep it under control!"
Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. Tell me, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,We're here! We're here! We made it to the Gala!
Tree Hugger,"The aura coming off the waterfall was so alive! So, like, magic manifestation."
Fluttershy,Wow.
Discord,"Oh, Fluttershy. I didn't see you there."
Fluttershy,How did you even know to look for an aura on a waterfall?
Fluttershy,Discord! I thought you weren't coming!
Discord,"No. I actually never said that. But funny how you remembered it that way. Anyway, good to see you. Tree Friend, is it? Your name is slipping my mind right now. How strange."
Tree Hugger,Nice to meet you. I'm Tree Hugger. Blessings.
Tree Hugger,"Cool! Like, in another life, maybe?"
Discord,You've gotta be kidding. You don't remember me?
Tree Hugger,"[laughs] I meet a lot of different creatures, each one of them perfect and unique."
Discord,"Yes, well, as I was saying, it's just great to be here with my oldest, bestest friend."
Fluttershy,"Am I really your oldest, bestest friend?"
Discord,"You? [laughs] Of course not! You think I don't have other friends? I'm centuries old! I was talking about the Smooze! Smooze Face, the Smoozinator <U+0096> well, I mean that's what we called him back in college. Smooze! I would like you to meet Fluttershy and, um, hmm... Tree... how'd you say it... Tree Embrace?"
Tree Hugger,"Oh, I like that! It's so in rhythm with my life force! [gasps] Maybe I'll change it!"
Fluttershy,[giggles] I can't believe I've never heard you speak of the Smooze before. Sounds like you two are so close.
Discord,"Well, I'm glad you got that, because that's what is true. We are."
Discord,Very close.
Fluttershy,That's wonderful! The four of us should go out to dinner sometime!
Discord,We should all go out to dinner sometime?! Have you no heart?
Discord,"Oh, oh! It looks like somepony wants to mingle. We'll be back in a bit."
Fluttershy,"Oh, okay. Treezie and I would love to talk to you more later!"
Discord,"Treezie? Really? Sort of a juvenile nickname, don't you think?"
Discord,Smoozie! Wait up!
Discord,"Now, listen, Smooze. I need to make this a party of one for a little while. Just stay out here until I come for you."
Tree Hugger,What's so funny?
Discord,Exactly!
Rainbow Dash,Uhh... I think we're gonna go hit the dance floor.
Discord,"Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here about the time that we went to the store and came back with two cakes instead of one, because that's how crazy we are when we're together."
Fluttershy,"Um, we went to the store and bought two cakes."
Discord,"Oh. Well, you kind of left out all the fun and frivolity there. But I'm sure you got it, Tree Hugger."
Tree Hugger,I got that you really like cake.
Discord,We like each other. That was the point! I'm actually pretty lukewarm about cake.
Rarity,[muffled screaming] Let me in!
Rarity,[gasps for breath] That creature took my jewels!
Twilight Sparkle,Discord! I thought I told you to keep your friend under control!
Discord,"Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night. [laughs nervously] What I mean to say is, that thing is a dear, dear friend, and I'll make sure that the ooze, uh, that he can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you. It's alright, everypony. Let's just get back to enjoying this magical evening!"
Discord,[to the Smooze] You are making me look like a fool in front of Fluttershy. I'll be back when the Gala is over.
Fluttershy,"[laughing] Oh, Tree Hugger, I've never known anypony as funny as you!"
Discord,"Check, check, check. Is this thing on? Good evening, fillies and germs! I just flew into Canterlot, and wow, are my interspecies parts tired!"
Discord,"I've only got these tiny mismatched wings, and even I can fly better than Twilight Sparkle! Am I right? Pchoo!"
Twilight Sparkle,Hey!
Discord,"[laughs nervously] Uh, well, perhaps you're into more observational humor."
Discord,Did you ever notice how you always materialize out of thin air? Why not thick air? What's the deal there?
Discord,Tough crowd.
Twilight Sparkle,What is he doing?!
Rainbow Dash,I think they're... jokes?
Pinkie Pie,Maud! Jokes!
Maud Pie,My favorite.
Discord,[muffled and out of focus] You might be a Ponyville pony when an ordinary night on the town ends in a lesson about friendship! [in focus] Knock knock!
Discord,"You're supposed to say ""Who's there?""! This is the most basic of jokes!"
Maud Pie,You're the most basic of jokes.
Pinkie Pie,"Good one, Maud!"
Twilight Sparkle,What is that?!
Twilight Sparkle,None of my magic works on this ooze! Can you stop it?
Princess Celestia,I'm afraid not!
Twilight Sparkle,"Discord, how could you bring him here?!"
Discord,"Oh, he's not that bad!"
Rarity,"Oh, my shoes will be ruined forever!"
Applejack,That's what you're worried about? Really?
Tree Hugger,This is kind of a bummer.
Discord,"Isn't it, though? And to think, it would never have happened had I come to the Gala as somepony else's plus-one."
Tree Hugger,"Seems like something might have harshed his flow, you know? Like, his senses are agitated."
Discord,You don't know anything about rare creatures. I've known Smooze Face for ages. He's not agitated. He's partying down! Whoo!
Tree Hugger,"All he needs is some, like, calming auditory therapy. I know I always feel really at peace when I'm being bathed in positive vibes. Maybe he'll calm down with some sonic bliss."
Discord,Do you even know what you just said?
Tree Hugger,Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee! Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
Tree Hugger,"Let go, Smooze! Bliss out! Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!"
Sweetie Belle,It worked!
Rainbow Dash,"Way to go, Tree Hugger!"
Fluttershy,That was the most magical thing I've ever seen done with animals!
Tree Hugger,"Oh, thanks, everypony. It makes perfect karmic sense why magic doesn't work on him. He only responds to vibrations that peace out his energy fields."
Discord,"Stop it! Stop it! That's it! I'm done with you, Tree Hugger!"
Tree Hugger,"Oh, man. You're really bumming me out. Can you just, like, lower your voice a skosh?"
Discord,A skosh? A skosh?!
Tree Hugger,"Whoa, dude! What is that?!"
Discord,Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm simply going to send you to another dimension. I can't have you interfering in my relationship with Fluttershy anymore!
Fluttershy,"Discord, stop!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, Fluttershy! We'll stop him!"
Discord,"I'm doing her a favor, Fluttershy! It's a lovely dimension! White sand beaches, attentive wait staff... I mean, okay, the humidity isn't great, but where isn't that the case these days?"
Fluttershy,I don't understand why you're doing this! We were all getting along so well!
Discord,"As well as we could, considering you've already stomped all over our friendship by inviting her to the biggest night of the year as if I didn't matter at all!"
Fluttershy,Did you really think I'd abandon you just because I have a new friend?!
Discord,"Yes, because that's what you did!"
Fluttershy,"No, Discord! I invited a friend to a party! I didn't abandon you! What if you had a friend that you could discuss chaos-based magic with? Would that mean we weren't friends anymore?!"
Discord,"Uh... [stuttering] No, I suppose not. It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things... Oh, oh, dear, it looks like I've perhaps overreacted just a skosh."
Fluttershy,"More like a lot of skoshes! Tree Hugger, could you give us a minute?"
Discord,I'm just so new at this whole friendship thing. It's so much more complicated than it looks.
Fluttershy,Do you think maybe you owe somepony an apology? Not me!
Discord,"Er, Tree Hugger, I'm sorry that you got caught in the middle of my... er, you know... wrath."
Tree Hugger,"Oh, it's all groovy. Um, I need like a few minutes to clear out my chakras before I can hug you from a place of authenticity."
Discord,"Oh, your chakras. [laughs nervously] Fair enough."
Discord,"I owe you an apology, Smooze. I spent the whole evening thinking about my own feelings and never thinking about yours."
Discord,"Well, friends! I think I may actually grow to like this multiple-friend thing."
Maud Pie,I like it too.
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, it's not a party until somepony spreads magic-resistant ooze uncontrollably over the ballroom! [squee] Come on, Smoozinator! Let's dance!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Princess Celestia. I thought I could give you a break tonight, but it turns out I was in over my head."
Princess Celestia,You have nothing to apologize for. This has been the most fun Gala in years!
Twilight Sparkle,"I know, it was a<U+0097>What?! But there was ooze all over the place! And one of the guests threatened to send somepony to another dimension!"
Princess Celestia,I know! Can you imagine how dull it would have been if I hadn't invited Discord? Come on! Whoo! The night is still young!
Pinkie Pie,"La, la-la, la-la! La, la-la, la-la, la la-la la-la! This is gonna be so great, Gummy! We have absolutely nothing to do today except bake! I've been waiting for just the right time to finally try Granny Pie's super-special triple-chocolate, fifteen-layer marjolaine recipe! It's gonna be amazing!"
Pinkie Pie,"Let's see. Nutty meringue, chocolate ganache, praline and nuts, cocoa-flavored buttercream..."
Pinkie Pie,An hour per layer <U+0096> that's fifteen hours of pure baking bliss!
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, Gummy, I think we're ready to start prepping the second layer!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, my gosh! My cutie mark! [gasps] You know what this means?! [hushed] The map!"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, Gummy? Could you take over for a bit? Hopefully this'll be quick. I'll just measure the baking powder for you... [squee] ...and when the first layer cools, you can drizzle some of the ganache over it. And don't forget to beat the egg whites for the meringue!"
Twilight Sparkle,"This is so exciting. The map is summoning you to Griffonstone, the very heart of the griffon kingdom! I don't know if either of you have read ""Bygone Griffons of Greatness"", but griffons were known to be<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,"Rude, insensitive bullies?"
Twilight Sparkle,You mean Gilda?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I mean Gilda! When she came to Ponyville, she was a total jerk to all my friends, especially Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie,She was a bit of a party pooper.
Rainbow Dash,Mm-hmm.
Twilight Sparkle,"So, maybe Gilda was a little rude. You still get to go to Griffonstone, and according to this book, it has a rich, fascinating history! [narrating] In ancient times, griffons were known to be as greedy as dragons, always hoarding their bits and other treasures. But all that changed when King Grover found the mysterious golden Idol of Boreas. Legend says the Idol of Boreas was made from the dust of golden sunsets, blown across the mountains by the north winds. Possessing the Idol of Boreas filled the griffons' hearts with pride. It's said that that one great treasure is responsible for turning Griffonstone into the most majestic kingdom of all the land."
Rainbow Dash,And why do you care so much about griffons anyway?
Twilight Sparkle,"It was actually Gilda's visit that made me curious. So I picked up ""Bygone Griffons of Greatness"", and I've been hooked ever since! And now... [sigh] Now you two get to see Griffonstone with your very own eyes."
Pinkie Pie,Huh? Just me and Rainbow Dash?
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, you can totally take my place if you want. [yawn] I still have half a nap to finish."
Pinkie Pie,"Why don't you just come with us? I mean, you are the Princess of Friendship."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, no, if the map wanted me to go to the coolest kingdom in all of Equestria and tour the palace and see the actual idol that unites an entire species, which would be super amazing, I'm sure it would've said so. You two can handle whatever the issue is just fine. I'll stay here and do important princessy things. I guess."
Pinkie Pie,"Well then, come on, Dashie! We're going to Griffonstone!"
Rainbow Dash,[sigh] Fine...
Pinkie Pie,"Whatcha reading, Rainbow?"
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Twilight literally wrote a book on what we need to do in Griffonstone.
Pinkie Pie,You mean like a guide on how to figure out what problem we're supposed to fix?
Rainbow Dash,"And then some. It's like Twilight herself in book form. [imitating Twilight] ""Always carry plenty of bits. The griffons are sure to help you as long as you share the wealth."""
Pinkie Pie,"[swallows] Uh, can I borrow some bits?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[voiceover] Upon arriving in Griffon Gorge, be sure to pause and cast your eyes northerly, up the Hyperborean Mountains, taking in the breathtaking beauty of Griffonstone. Once in Griffonstone proper, go immediately to the palace and introduce yourself to the king. ""Bygone Griffons of Greatness"" was written a long time ago, and it ends with the coronation of the fourteenth king of the griffons, King Guto. I have no idea who's in charge now. Tell the king you've been sent by the Princess of Friendship, and you're there to help with some sort of problem. If for some reason the king can't help, I'd try the Griffonstone library next. It's a little known secret that if you befriend a librarian, you can usually find out anything. Plus, as a bonus, there's a statue of King Grover outside! [giggles] Photo op! And don't forget to sample some famous griffon scones. They're supposed to be the best."
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, Twilight should've come along! Then she could see first-hoof that Griffonstone is..."
Pinkie Pie,...a total dump!
Rainbow Dash,Ugh. Maybe the map should've called Rarity instead of us.
Pinkie Pie,"Excuse me, sir? This is Griffonstone, right?"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, that wasn't very nice."
Rainbow Dash,See? These griffons are exactly like I'd thought they'd be.
Pinkie Pie,Maybe we should just find the palace so we can ask the king what's going on.
Gilda,"We don't have a king, losers."
Rainbow Dash,"Hello, Gilda."
Gilda,Dash.
Pinkie Pie,Pinkie!
Rainbow Dash,What are you doing here?
Gilda,"Uh, I'm a griffon? What's your excuse, dweebs?"
Pinkie Pie,Hey! These 'dweebs' are here to help Griffonstone!
Gilda,Help it what?
Pinkie Pie,"Well... we're not really sure! But it involves a map and our cutie marks and a problem, and<U+0097>"
Gilda,Bored now!
Pinkie Pie,"Well if you don't have a king, could you at least tell us where the Idol of Boreas is?"
Gilda,Ha-ha! Don't tell me you really believe in that thing.
Grampa Gruff,It was the best thing to ever happen to us griffons!
Gilda,"Oh, great. Now you got Grampa Gruff started!"
Grampa Gruff,I'll tell you the whole tragic tale... [laughing] ...for a couple of bits.
Grampa Gruff,"The first griffon king, King Grover, united our kind like we've never been united before or since! And he did it all with that incredible Idol of Boreas."
Grampa Gruff,"That idol brought pride to the heart of every griffon that saw it! From one king to the next, Griffonstone had our golden idol. We were the envy of all other species. [narrating] It held us together <U+0096> it gave us an identity <U+0096> right up until the reign of King Guto."
Grampa Gruff,"[narrating] That's when Arimaspi came to steal our griffon treasure! King Guto tried to fight him off, but Arimaspi managed to get away with the idol!"
Grampa Gruff,"[narrating] They say when our treasure fell into the Abysmal Abyss, our pride went with it. King Guto was the last king of Griffonstone, and we all lived miserably ever after. The end!"
Pinkie Pie,[tearing up] That was the saddest story ever!
Grampa Gruff,"Aw, well... Tough tailfeathers! No refunds!"
Pinkie Pie,No wonder Twilight's book ended with the coronation of King Guto. Who would want to record a history that sad?
Gilda,It's not sad! Do we look sad to you?
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie, I think I know why the map sent us here. We need to find the Idol of Boreas and bring glory and pride back to Griffonstone!"
Gilda,"Ha-ha. Here we go <U+0096> typical pony hero complex. None of us care about that dumb old idol. Don't you get it? We don't care about anything, and that's the way we like it!"
Pinkie Pie,I think Rainbow Dash is right! The map sent us here to fix some sort of problem!
Gilda,The only problem Griffonstone has is you!
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I don't care what she says. We're gonna find that treasure, make Griffonstone cool again, and get back to Ponyville! Come on!"
Pinkie Pie,"Wait, Rainbow Dash. What about Twilight's advice?"
Rainbow Dash,"What, taking a bunch of pictures?"
Pinkie Pie,She mentioned finding answers at the library.
Rainbow Dash,"Knock yourself out. But when you get bored with Twilight's tour book, I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss finding the Idol of Boreas."
Rainbow Dash,I'm here to find your missing idol and save Griffonstone!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, I'll need some rope, a grappling hook, and a guide to take me down to the Abysmal Abyss."
Storekeeper,And I'll need some bits.
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Gilda! Word on the street is that Griffonstone has an amazing library chock-full of answers!"
Gilda,Word on what street?
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, maybe not this street, but on other streets, your library is the talk of the town."
Gilda,"The library's right there, so why don't you go inside and leave me alone?!"
Pinkie Pie,"[gasps] Maybe it's good that Twilight didn't come... [to statue] It's sad what happened to your town, King, but Rainbow Dash can't be right. This can't all be because of a missing hunk of gold. [as King Grover] You are right, Pinkie! And you've got amazing hair! [normal] Aw, King Grover, you old charmer!"
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] I know what Griffonstone needs!
Gilda,Fewer ponies?
Gilda,Can't sing here!
Pinkie Pie,But how do you break into uplifting musical numbers with no singing?
Gilda,"Yeah, that's Griffonstone's biggest problem <U+0096> lack of uplifting musical numbers."
Pinkie Pie,"Well if I can't sing, how about a party? If there's one thing these griffons need, it's a good cheer! Where's your party store?"
Pinkie Pie,"No party store? Uh, how about cake? Nothing cheers folks up like cake! Where's a bakery?"
Gilda,Ugh.
Pinkie Pie,"No singing, no party store, no bakery?! What is this place?!"
Gilda,You're welcome to leave [suddenly yelling] at any time!
Pinkie Pie,"Well, that just takes the cake. Wait, no! It can't take the cake 'cause there is no cake! Or muffins! Or griffon scones!"
Gilda,"Oh, we got griffon scones. That's my specialty."
Gilda,Bits first!
Gilda,Well?
Gilda,"What, you like it? That's my Grampa Gruff's secret recipe."
Pinkie Pie,[with mouth full] Ow! I think I broke a tooth!
Gilda,"Well, whatever. No refunds. I don't even care anyway. I just want to sell enough of these so that I can leave this lousy town."
Pinkie Pie,[spits] I can help you with that!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, you think you could tighten the strap on my helmet?"
Storekeeper,Can you give me more bits?
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Never mind, I got it. So how deep is this abyss?"
Storekeeper,How deep are your pockets?
Rainbow Dash,Don't you griffons ever talk about anything but bits?
Storekeeper,Gimme some bits and I'll answer.
Rainbow Dash,No wonder Gilda's such a delight.
Pinkie Pie,"[chewing] Grampa Gruff's recipe is good, but it's missing one important ingredient."
Gilda,"Don't tell me. ""Friendship""?"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, no. Baking powder. Lucky for you, I never leave home without it! Now just pop those in the oven, and you'll have griffon scones worth their weight in gold!"
Gilda,Greta!
Pinkie Pie,"Aha! I saw that, Gilda! You may act like a gruff, grumbling griffon, but inside you're gracious and great!"
Gilda,What are you talking about?
Pinkie Pie,You just helped your friend up when she got knocked down.
Gilda,"What, her? Greta's just some griffon I know. We don't have friends here! [sighs] I did have a friend once, but you saw how that turned out."
Pinkie Pie,"[poink!] [slide whistle noise] Oh, my gosh, I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!"
Gilda,See ya.
Rainbow Dash,"[shouting] You sure we can't just fly down? Whoa! Never mind, totally got my answer there."
Rainbow Dash,Just gotta find that golden idol and get out of this place.
Rainbow Dash,[screaming] Whoooa!
Rainbow Dash,"Ow, ooh! My hoof! Help! Throw me another rope!"
Storekeeper,You got bits?
Pinkie Pie,[in distance] There you are! Forget about finding the idol! I figured out how to solve Griffonstone's real problem <U+0096> scones!
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie, you get back here!"
Pinkie Pie,[in distance] Yeah?
Rainbow Dash,[in distance] Can you throw down a rope or something?
Pinkie Pie,[in distance] Lemme look!
Pinkie Pie,One rope coming up!
Pinkie Pie,We need help. Don't go anywhere!
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Where does she think I'm gonna go?
Rainbow Dash,[panicked noises] I hope I don't go anywhere!
Pinkie Pie,"Rainbow Dash is stuck on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss, and I need your help to save her!"
Gilda,Not my problem.
Pinkie Pie,Of course it's your problem! She's your friend!
Gilda,Used to be.
Pinkie Pie,Can't you remember when she was?
Gilda,Yeah. Of course.
Young Hoops,Doesn't that griffon know she's supposed to fly at the Junior Speedsters Flight Camp?
Young Rainbow Dash,"Maybe she just doesn't want to make you look bad! Hey there, I'm Rainbow Dash! And you are...?"
Young Gilda,Uh... G-G-G-G-Gilda.
Young Rainbow Dash,"You sure about that? Stick with me, Gilda, and those guys won't give you any more guff. Whoa! You're awesome!"
Young Gilda,"[laughing] You too, Rainbow Dash!"
Young Rainbow Dash,"Well, Gilda, let's show these guys how it's done!"
Young Gilda,"Junior Speedsters are our lives,"
Young Rainbow Dash,"Skybound soars and daring dives,"
Young Gilda and Young Rainbow Dash,"Junior Speedsters, it's our quest to someday be the very best!"
Gilda,Fine. I'll help her. But that doesn't make me her friend.
Pinkie Pie,Duly noted. [to the audience] Except it does!
Gilda,"Hang on, loser! I'm coming!"
Rainbow Dash,"What took you so long, doofus?!"
Pinkie Pie,Rainbow Dash! I'm coming for you!
Pinkie Pie,Gotcha!
Rainbow Dash,I'm slipping!
Rainbow Dash,The idol!
Gilda,You're more important to me than some dumb chunk of gold.
Pinkie Pie,"Hugging later, climbing now!"
Gilda,I'm really sorry about how I treated you two.
Rainbow Dash,"Thanks, Gilda."
Pinkie Pie,Apology accepted.
Rainbow Dash,And I'm just sorry we didn't get your idol back. Now we'll never be able to solve Griffonstone's problem.
Pinkie Pie,That's what I was trying to tell you! The map didn't send us here to find the lost Idol of Boreas. It sent us here to replace it with something better!
Gilda,Nothing's better than gold to a griffon.
Pinkie Pie,"That's because you don't have friendship! If you can learn to care about each other again, Griffonstone could be a mightier kingdom than it ever was before! And you don't need some golden idol to do that. You just need each other."
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, Pinkie. That was... really sappy."
Pinkie Pie,"Eh, what can I say? That's how I roll. Go on, Gilda! Go make a friend!"
Rainbow Dash,"I don't know, Pinkie. You really think these griffons are up for this? We aren't exactly in Ponyville, you know."
Gilda,"Okay, so she was really weirded out until I gave her the scone. Then she tried it and said it tasted good! That's the first nice thing anygriffon's ever said to me!"
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa, Pinkie. I guess that really was the problem we needed to solve."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, we'd better be heading home."
Gilda,What? Y-Y-You want me to spread friendship here by myself?! How am I supposed to do that?! I haven't even made one single friend yet!
Rainbow Dash,"No, you haven't. You've made two."
Pinkie Pie,[tearing up] Hugging! Hugging now!
Gilda,"But you'll come back and visit, right?"
Rainbow Dash,Just try and stop us!
Pinkie Pie,"[to statue] See ya later, you old charmer."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, Pinkie? Who are you talking to?"
Pinkie Pie,"Nopony! Come on, let's go home and see how Gummy did with Granny Pie's marjolaine recipe!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"I'll never understand the ponies in this town! Everywhere I went, they were all gussied up and lookin' at me funny! Kept asking if I was ""nervous""!"
Matilda,Did they forget the wedding is tomorrow?
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Oh, maybe they're just as excited for us to be married as I am."
Matilda,"Well, they're going to feel awfully silly when they realize they've got the wrong date. [gasps] The invitations are wrong! This says the wedding is today!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,But I got such a good deal on them...
Matilda,Everypony in town got these! The princesses have even RSVP'd!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,I told you we should have eloped!
Matilda,"Oh, dear. The caterer, the flowers, the musicians! We've got to move it all to today!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,What?!
Matilda,Where's my wedding planner?!
Derpy,Muffin?
Derpy,"I really messed up on those invitations! I feel just awful, Doc!"
Savoir Fare,Hmph! Perhaps that explains why I never got mine!
Derpy,"I told Cranky I could get 'em printed for cheap, but that meant hiring somepony with no experience using a printing press."
Derpy,"Oh, I wish there was a way I could go back in time and fix all this."
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Going back in time is old thinking, my friend. I was working off a cutting-edge theory of making time come forward to you."
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. My life's work, decades <U+0096> centuries, really <U+0096> of research and experimentation, and I nearly had it cracked! Turns out there's a magic spell for it. Who knew?"
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. But there are so many things that magic can't explain, where science and mathematics are the real magic!"
Derpy,Like these? They're pretty.
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Ah, yes, my flameless fireworks. I never could quite figure out how to get them to ignite."
Derpy,How did you learn to make all this stuff anyway?
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. I've been studying science my whole life. Ever since a particularly traumatic experience as a foal, I've been looking for ways to make sense of the world around me. Science provides explanations of things we never thought possible! Now, why did we come here again?"
Derpy,Yeah. Oh! Because I accidentally sent out invitations for Cranky and Matilda's wedding with today's date instead of tomorrow's!
Dr. Hooves,Dr. Great whickering stallions! I completely forgot! And I still need to get my suit tailored!
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. [to DJ Pon-3] Please! You've got to help me! I lost track of time, unbelievably, and forgot that the wedding is this afternoon! [completely drowned out by hip-hop] Have you seen Rarity? She's got to alter the sleeves on my suit, and she's got to do it now! Oh, ha-ha, thank goodness. Lead on, my friend."
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Er, why have you brought me here? Rarity would never set hoof in<U+0097>"
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Great whickering stallions, they've got style! Gentlecolts! I'm facing certain calamity, and I couldn't help noticing your remarkable fashion sense. Could I have the name of your incredible tailor?"
Jeff Letrotski,"Oh, yeah, man. His name is me."
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. ""Me"". What an unfortunate name."
Jeff Letrotski,"No, man, like, I manufacture all of my own garments. We all do, man."
Dr. Hooves,Dr. Then you've got to help me! I need this suit tailored! It's an emergency!
Jeff Letrotski,"[laughs] Sorry, man, we're just about to start the finals."
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. What's this word you keep using <U+0096> ""man""?"
Jeff Letrotski,"I dunno, man, but guess what? Our fourth didn't show, so if you roll with us, we'll alter your suit for you."
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. I'm sorry, gentlecolts, but I will not bowl. The splits, the spares! There are simply too many variables!"
Jeff Letrotski,"Variables? What are you talking about, man? Just throw the ball straight!"
Dr. Hooves,Dr. Hold on. Straight?
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Very well. I'll try your ""straight"" technique. It just might be crazy enough to work."
Octavia Melody,Do we know what they're on about?
Apple Bloom,"The way they're huddled up like that, I'd say it's either a friendship problem or a monster attack."
Octavia Melody,"A monster attack?! Blast! I'm performing at the ceremony this afternoon, and I still haven't sorted out what to play. How am I meant to practice with a monster invading Ponyville?"
Sweetie Belle,"Maybe it's just a friendship problem, and it'll all be cleared up in half an hour or so."
Octavia Melody,[groan] I hope so.
Matilda,Where's Pinkie Pie?! I need my wedding planner!
Matilda,"Oh, no! On my wedding day?! Somepony's gotta help me! You!"
Amethyst Star,Me?
Matilda,I need to move an entire wedding from tomorrow to today!
Amethyst Star,But nopony's asked me to organize anything since Twilight came to town.
Matilda,So you'll do it?
Amethyst Star,I used to be the best organizer in all of Ponyville. You bet I'll<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,Whoa!
Matilda,Come on! We better get to the salon before that monster flattens it!
Derpy,What am I gonna do? [gasp] Matilda! I feel so bad about the invitations! Is there anything I can do<U+0097>
Matilda,FLOWERS!
Lily Valley,You want Matilda's arrangements... today?!
Daisy,This is awful!
Rose,"The horror, the horror!"
Derpy,So there's no way you can do it?
Lily Valley,"We don't even have Matilda's flowers in yet, much less arranged! [gasps] This is a disaster!"
Derpy,Okay. Thanks anyway.
Lily Valley,"[gasps] Look, girls! A broken stem on one of the zinnias!"
Daisy,Whaaat?!
Rose,"Oh, the horror, the horror!"
Sweetie Drops,"I have to admit, when Matilda said we needed this place ready by today, I was a little nervous."
Lyra Heartstrings,"With you by my side, I knew we'd get it done in time."
Sweetie Drops,"There is nothing like a best friend, is there?"
Lyra Heartstrings,Anything's possible when you know somepony as well as we know each other!
Sweetie Drops,What was that?
Lyra Heartstrings,There's some monster attacking Ponyville or something.
Sweetie Drops,What is it this time? A creature from the Everfree Forest?
Sweetie Drops,Did you say bugbear? It found me!
Lyra Heartstrings,"What are you talking about, Bon Bon?"
Sweetie Drops,"My name isn't Bon Bon. It's ""Special Agent Sweetie Drops"". I work for a super-secret anti-monster agency in Canterlot, or at least I did until the bugbear went missing from Tartarus a few years back."
Lyra Heartstrings,What are you talking about?
Sweetie Drops,"When it escaped, we had to shutter the whole agency. Every last shred of evidence of the organization's existence was destroyed. Celestia demanded complete deniability."
Lyra Heartstrings,...What?
Sweetie Drops,"It was me who captured the bugbear. I had to go deep cover here in Ponyville and assume the name Bon Bon. I never thought it'd be able to track me, but now it has."
Lyra Heartstrings,Are you saying our whole friendship was based on a lie?!
Sweetie Drops,"I'm sorry, Lyra! I couldn't tell you for your own protection!"
Lyra Heartstrings,B-b-but the lunches! The-the long talks! The benches we sat on! [tearing up] None of that was real?!
Sweetie Drops,It was all real. You're my very best friend.
Sweetie Drops,I've got to go find a crowd to blend into before I put you in danger! I'll see you at the wedding.
Lyra Heartstrings,Fine! But we're going to talk about this later!
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"I need my ring today, no matter the cost! ...As long as it doesn't cost any extra."
Jeff Letrotski,"Seven/ten split, man. Harshest of the harsh. But if you pick this up, we win the whole shebang!"
Derpy,Doc! I've finally figured out how I can help! Your flameless fireworks look just like flowers! I'll use them for the wedding!
Dr. Hooves,Dr. Great whickering stallions! Wait!
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Wait! The flameless fireworks are extremely volatile! Without knowing what the trigger is, they could go off at any moment! My word, is that a bugbear?"
Matilda,"Oh, there are so many things I'm forgetting! I hope Cranky remembers to tell the musicians! Oh! Oh! I'll never get my mane done in time!"
Lotus Blossom,"You must relax, my dear! We can handle anything! We once did a pony's hair during the ceremony!"
Steven Magnet,"Oh, it's true, it's true! They really are the best! Matilda, I've just got to say, I already feel like we're family."
Matilda,You do?
Steven Magnet,"Of course! I'm Steven Magnet, Cranky's best beast!"
Matilda,You're Steven Magnet?
Steven Magnet,"Well, what'd you expect, a bugbear? I've known Cranky forev-er! Surely he must have told you about the time he saved me from Flash Freeze Lake?"
Matilda,...You're Steven Magnet.
Steven Magnet,"Oh, I know, I know! Typical Cranky, to leave out minor details, like the fact that I'm, y'know, a sea monster, right? [laughs] I just love that old burro!"
Matilda,"I'm sorry, Steven. I guess I assumed you were a pony. And I had no idea you had such adventures together."
Steven Magnet,"Oh, honey, you don't know the half of it! But let me tell you something. In all that we've been through together, the only thing he ever cared about was finding you."
Matilda,Really?
Matilda,"He is the sweetest thing, isn't he? All the stress I've put myself through. All the stress I've put him through. The only thing that matters is that we're together. The wedding isn't the important thing <U+0096> the marriage is."
Steven Magnet,"[laughing] Oh, goodness gracious. If you believe that, I have got a bridge to sell you! All these ponies traveling to Ponyville, putting on uncomfortable clothes, sitting through a long ceremony, you think any of them care about the marriage? [laughing] Honey, the wedding is everything."
Octavia Melody,[gasps] That's more like it!
Octavia Melody,Stop! I'm going to be late for the wedding!
Octavia Melody,Something like that might work.
Princess Celestia,[hushed] What do you mean you left it on the counter?!
Princess Luna,[hushed] I thought you were bringing it!
Princess Celestia,"[hushed] [groans] Well, this is just wonderful!"
Princess Luna,"[hushed] I handled the gift for Cadance and Shining Armor! You were supposed to do this one, remember?"
Princess Celestia,"[hushed] Well, we can't just come to this wedding empty-hoofed!"
Princess Cadance,[sighs] It's alright. He always cries at weddings.
Princess Cadance,...Usually it's not until the wedding starts.
Sweetie Drops,"Attention, everypony! Our friends have done it! They've defeated the bugbear!"
Sweetie Drops,[to Lyra] Hey.
Lyra Heartstrings,Hello.
Sweetie Drops,"So, uh, you didn't happen to mention our earlier conversation about my [hushed through gritted teeth] secret identity [normal] to anypony, did you?"
Lyra Heartstrings,"No. I did not. And you're not the only one with a secret, y'know. You know those expensive imported oats you were saving for a special occasion? I cooked them up and ate them! All of them! [laughs] It's sort of thrilling to reveal your deepest, darkest secrets!"
Sweetie Drops,[laughs] That's what best friends are for.
Princess Celestia,"[hushed] Next time, you can just bring your own gift, and I'll bring mine."
Princess Luna,[hushed] Fine.
Dr. Hooves,Dr. There you are! My suit has vanished and this was the only thing left in my closet! How do I look?
Derpy,Like a million bits!
Dr. Hooves,"Dr. Great whickering stallions, look at the time! We'd better get inside. Allons-y!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,I can't believe I lost my hair! I look ridiculous. The love of my life deserves better than this!
Steven Magnet,"Have no fear, Cranky, my dear. It's Steven Magnet's mustache to the rescue!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Aw, thanks, buddy."
Steven Magnet,"Oh, no problem. Now you get in there and marry that donkey!"
Mayor Mare,"Well, is everypony here?"
Derpy,"All set, Mayor!"
Mayor Mare,"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join these two in mare-trimony. As I look around this room, I can only imagine how uncomfortable Cranky must be."
Mayor Mare,"But I also see so many ponies from all trots of life, brought together by love. Cranky searched all across this great land of ours to find Matilda, and no matter what obstacles kept them apart, love would finally bring them together, just as it has brought all of us together now. It's remarkable to me how a story like Cranky's search for Matilda could fill this room with such a unique collection of ponies! It makes you realize that everypony is the star of their own story. And it's not just the main characters in our stories that make life so rich! It's everypony <U+0096> those who play big parts and those who play small. If it weren't for everypony in this room and many more who couldn't be here today, Cranky and Matilda's lives wouldn't be as full and vibrant as they are."
Mayor Mare,"And so, in front of all these loved ones... Cranky, do you take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,You bet I do!
Mayor Mare,"And do you, Matilda, take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
Matilda,[tearing up] I do!
Mayor Mare,"Then I'm proud to say, I now pronounce you jack and jenny!"
Dr. Hooves,Dr. [laughs] Of course! They need love to ignite! How could I have missed it?!
Twilight Sparkle,"You know something, girls? We are so lucky to live in this town. I love you all!"
Rainbow Dash,Ow! That's where the bugbear bit me!
Twilight Sparkle,Sorry!
Princess Luna,Welcome to the Grand Equestria Pony Summit!
Princess Celestia,"You delegates have traveled far and wide to represent your cities as we seek to celebrate and learn from all the unique places that make up our wonderful land of Equestria. At tonight's welcome reception, Princess Cadance will dedicate this beautiful friendship statue made up of gemstones from each of your home cities."
Princess Celestia,Now I'd like to turn things over to the one who organized the summit: Princess Twilight Sparkle!
Twilight Sparkle,"[tired] Thank you, everypony. With delegates from over fifty cities attending three days of conferences, receptions, and meetings, this is the largest Grand Equestria Pony Summit yet. And let me tell you, putting it all together has led to more than one sleepless night. We're so excited to have you here and to learn more about life all across this great land of ours."
Twilight Sparkle,And now my faithful assistant Spike would like to say a few words.
Spike,"Um, hello, everypony! I'm here to help any way I can. So if there's anything I can do for any of you<U+0097>"
Neigh Sayer,"We love you, Princess Twilight!"
Delegate 2,We love all the princesses!
Spike,[sighs] I guess everypony loves a princess. Hmph.
Spike,Ugh!
Princess Cadance,Spike!
Princess Cadance,Spike?
Spike,[muffled] A little help?
Princess Cadance,"Spike, we need you!"
Spike,Of course! What can I do?
Spike,"Whoa, what happened to you?"
Princess Cadance,She's been awake three straight days preparing for the summit. We need to make sure she gets some rest today. She'll never be able to attend the welcome reception in this condition. Can I count on you to see to it that she isn't disturbed?
Spike,I promise! I won't let you down!
Spike,Perfect.
Spike,Not on my watch.
Spike,"Uh, excuse me? Can you keep it down a little? Oh, no!"
Spike,I'll give you birdseed! Worms! Anything! Just please stop singing before you wake the princess!
Spike,Huh. I can't believe that worked.
Spike,Hyah!
Spike,"[sighs] Uh, hi fellas. Sorry to break up your game, but there's sort of an important diplomatic summit kind of thingy going on, and it involves a princess needing to sleep, and, uh... maybe you could move your game somewhere else?"
Horticultural Pegasus,"Uh, these are too top-heavy. Wouldn't take much to bring these beauties down."
Spike,[strained] Can't you just wait a few hours?
Horticultural Pegasus,"Sorry, it's a public hazard. I got my orders."
Horticultural Pegasus,"Princess Twilight? [laughs] Why didn't you say so? Gee, I reckon they'll keep a few more hours."
Spike,Huh. Good thing I've got the princesses on my side.
Spike,"[vibrating yelps] Aw, come on! Excuse me? [shouting] Excuse me, sir! I really need you to<U+0097> [jackhammer stops] <U+0097>stop right now! Oops."
Public Works Pony,"[loudly] Lemme guess, the noise? Sorry, but we can't have a broken water main!"
Spike,"Ugh, you couldn't do this yesterday?!"
Public Works Pony,"[loudly] Hey, pal, I'm just tryin' to make sure everything runs smooth for the summit!"
Spike,"But there is no summit without Princess Twilight, and she needs things to be kept quiet around here. So if you don't mind, I'd<U+0097>"
Public Works Pony,"[loudly] All right, all right, if that's how she wants it! [beat] [quickly] But if something happens, it ain't my fault!"
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": ...Oh, lemme tell you somethin', alright? I worked forever on this speech, and I know I have more<U+0097>"
Spike,"Uh, hi. Can I help you?"
Others,"""March Gustysnows"": My friend here, the distinguished pony from up Manehattan, and I are in a bit of a pickle, and we need the Princess Twilight to resolve it."
Spike,"Uh, can you talk a little quieter? And maybe come back later?"
Others,"""March Gustysnows"": Oh, sure now, gosh, I wish we could but, uh, we're both supposed to give speeches about our local economies in five minutes, and we've been booked in the same hall!"
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": I had the room first. And let's be honest, my speech is more important."
Others,"""March Gustysnows"": Point of order there, sir, but I think you'll find that my speech is the more important one, don't'cha know?"
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": Look, youse is gonna have a lot of unhappy delegates on your hooves unless we get a ruling from Princess Twilight right now!"
Spike,[sighs] Lemme see what I can do.
Twilight Sparkle,[snoring] Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,Does something need scheduling?
Spike,"Oh, uh, yeah. Two delegates have speeches booked in the same hall. What do I do?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, no problem. Just put the hay in the apple and eat the candle, hm?"
Spike,Huh?
Spike,"Oh, I need an answer, but Twilight can't even think straight! Oh, my gosh, what am I supposed to do?!"
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": Well? What did she say? She picked me, right?"
Others,"""March Gustysnows"": Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be too hasty there, good sir. I got a feeling she went with me."
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": He-hey, if she didn't pick me, it ain't hard to see that as an insult to all of Manehattan! You know what I'm sayin'?"
Others,"""March Gustysnows"": And it'd sure be a shame to see something like a scheduling issue create a nasty old rift between Whinnyapolis and Ponyville."
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": So? What did the Princess say?"
Others,"""March Gustysnows"": Come on, now! Spit it out!"
Spike,"Um, she said that... Well, she said that she... she wants you to... share it?"
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": If that's what the princess wants, what are ya gonna do?"
Others,"""March Gustysnows"": The princess is always right!"
Annoyed Delegate,Combining those two talks was a disaster! The hall was overcrowded and the speakers just shouted over each other!
Spike,Huh? B-but<U+0097>
Annoyed Delegate,Why would the princess have made such a decision?!
Fluffy Clouds,"I was really looking forward to the ""Don't Spend All Your Bits"" Speech, but when I went into the hall, [tearing up] a pony had taken my seat. A pony who used to be my friend!"
Spike,"Your friend took your seat? Hah, big deal! Why don't you just<U+0097>"
Fluffy Clouds,"No offense, but I don't need some random dragon's opinion. I-I want to hear what Princess Twilight thinks."
Spike,[sighs] Fine.
Spike,Uh...
Spike,The princess says no friendship should end over a seat. You should forgive your friend!
Fluffy Clouds,"[gasps] Of course! Oh, the princess is so wise!"
Spike,I could tell these delegates anything as long as they think it came from Twilight. [beat] Alright! Who's next?
Spike,"So, how can Princess Twilight be of service?"
Fancy Pants,"Well, as host city, the Canterlot delegation feels it's only right that we should get passes to every meeting and party, yes?"
Spike,"Well, that doesn't seem fair<U+0097>I mean, Princess Twilight doesn't think that seems fair."
Fancy Pants,"Ehhh... yes, yes, very well. It was worth a try though, wasn't it, old chap, hm?"
Spike,This is great! I just took care of a whole bunch of stuff that Twilight won't have to worry about when she wakes up! Wonder if anypony else needs the princess's help?
Spike,"If I can check a few of these meetings off Twilight's schedule, then when she wakes up, she won't have to think about anything but the reception."
Spike,"Uh, it says here you have a meeting with Princess Twilight?"
Others,"""Frazzle Rock"": [lisping] Uh, yuppers. She wanted me to prep her on all the different gemstones in the Citizens of Equestria statue before the reception tonight."
Spike,"Okay, go ahead."
Others,"""Frazzle Rock"": [lisping] Um, well, I'd rather, um, tell the princess directly."
Spike,"Well, if it helps, you can call me ""Princess Spike"". No-no-no, it's alright. The princess asked me to take care of a few things for her. That's why I came to find you."
Others,"""Frazzle Rock"": [lisping] Um, if you say so."
Spike,The princess says so!
Others,"""Frazzle Rock"": [lisping] Uh, okay. Let's start with topaz..."
Spike,I'm here for your two o'clock!
Public Works Pony,You?! But I'm supposed to be briefing Princess Twilight on the progress with the water main!
Spike,I speak for the Princess.
Public Works Pony,"Uh, well, uh, can I start fixing it again? I'm getting a little worried, to be honest."
Spike,"Actually, Twilight still needs her rest, and her no-noise policy is still in effect for a few more hours. Sorry."
Princess Cadance,"Hey, Spike. What's going on?"
Spike,"Oh, you know, just settin' 'em up and knockin' 'em down!"
Princess Cadance,What do you mean?
Spike,"Not only have I kept things quiet so Twilight could sleep, I also took care of all her afternoon meetings so she won't have to worry about them when she wakes up."
Princess Cadance,Are you sure she'd want you doing that? There are so many things to keep track of at this summit.
Spike,"Nah, don't worry. I got it covered. I know Twilight so well, it's easy to make decisions like her!"
Princess Cadance,"Oh, okay. Well, thank you for keeping Twilight's stress level down. As long as that's the real reason you're doing it."
Spike,"Well, why else would I be doing it?"
Princess Cadance,You're not enjoying speaking for Twilight a little bit?
Spike,[sighs] [vibrating] By order of the princess.
Spike,[through gritted teeth] By order of the princess...!
Princess Cadance,"It sure is, but it's also hard work, isn't it?"
Spike,"Eh, it's not so bad."
Princess Cadance,"Spike, I'm concerned you might be abusing your relationship with Twilight."
Spike,"What are you talking about? I'm a great princess<U+0097>I mean, Twilight's a great princess! And I've been working hard to help her! When two delegates had a falling out, I'm the one who fixed their friendship! I listened to that pony drone on about gems for forty-five minutes so Twilight wouldn't have to! I moved a polo match away from the tower so she could sleep! And I didn't even eat that delicious looking statue! I'm a decision-making master!"
Spike,[sighs] Okay. So maybe I did get a little carried away making decisions. But it's not like anything bad happened.
Spike,This is unexpected!
Princess Cadance,I'll go shut off the main! You get rid of the water!
Spike,"Oh, bless me..."
Fancy Pants,"Oh, my! What is the meaning of this?!"
Spike,"Well, uh, you see, there was this polo game, and<U+0097>"
Fancy Pants,How could you let a water main burst on Canterlot's most important day?!
Public Works Pony,"Hey, don't look at me! Princess Twilight said to stop working on it!"
Fancy Pants,"Well, what about these trees?! I ordered them trimmed to avoid just such a situation!"
Horticultural Pegasus,"But the princess told me to stop, bub!"
Fancy Pants,Why would the princess make such horrible decisions?! This all could have been prevented!
Spike,"Please, everypony, listen! I'm so sorry all this happened!"
Fancy Pants,What are you apologizing for? These were Princess Twilight's awful decisions!
Others,"""March Gustysnows"": I'm about to blow my stack on Princess Twilight, I'll tell you that for nothin'!"
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": Yeah, me too!"
Fancy Pants,"I'll not let Princess Twilight give Canterlot a bad name in the eyes of Equestria! Come on, everypony! Let's go give her a piece of our minds!"
Spike,Please! You've got it all wrong!
Spike,"[panting] Wait! I mean, [hushed] wait!"
Fancy Pants,What is it now?! There's an angry mob here that demands satisfaction!
Spike,"It's just that, uh, we don't want to wake the princess, do we?"
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": Wake her?! What?! You're tellin' me that she's asleep?!"
Fancy Pants,"[muffled] Princess, we must speak at once!"
Spike,She is SLEEPING!
Twilight Sparkle,"[yawns] I'm glad you're here, Spike. We've got a lot to do! Do you know if the water main was fixed?"
Spike,"Uh, you seem well-rested."
Twilight Sparkle,I haven't slept like that since I was a filly!
Spike,"You haven't? Well, at least I got one thing right. And it was the one thing Cadance asked of me. Maybe I did do a good job today!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Fancy Pants, what's wrong?"
Fancy Pants,"Don't play games with me, Princess! You know why I'm here!"
Twilight Sparkle,Is this about the special privileges you wanted? Because this seems a little extreme!
Fancy Pants,The special privileges?! The last thing on my mind is special privileges!
Twilight Sparkle,"What's going on, Spike?"
Spike,"Um... you needed to sleep. And Princess Cadance told me you weren't to be disturbed. And there was this bird, and, well... long story short, I made a few decisions on your behalf."
Twilight Sparkle,A few decisions?!
Spike,"Well, maybe more than a few, but I had good intentions! Honest! Until I... didn't anymore. I'm sorry, Twilight. I guess I got a little carried away. It-it just felt so good to have ponies caring about my opinions on such important matters. I guess I was just enjoying feeling like a princess."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, Spike, one of the most important things a princess can do is realize when she's made a mistake and fix it."
Spike,How do I do that?
Princess Cadance,You could start with them.
Spike,"[sighs] Uh, hi there, everypony. So I guess I owe you all a pretty big apology. It's funny. Here we are at a summit that brings together ponies from all across Equestria, and all I could think about was myself. You all came here to celebrate the things that make each of our cities so unique and special. But instead of getting into the spirit of things like all of you, I used my friend's position to make myself feel good."
Fancy Pants,"The Canterlot ruby goes here, old sport."
Others,"""March Gustysnows"": And ours goes here, don't'cha know?"
Spike,Does this mean you forgive me?
Others,"""Joe Pescolt"": Sure! You know, the whole idea of the statue is that when each of us plays our own small part, it adds up to somethin' great."
Fancy Pants,Quite. Just like how all our cities make up the beautiful land of Equestria!
Princess Cadance,"I hereby dedicate the Citizens of Equestria statue to everypony who plays their part, no matter how big or how small!"
Twilight Sparkle,You look nervous. There's no reason to be nervous. Nothing to worry about. Everything's gonna be fine!
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, tell those butterflies in your tummy to beat it! Making new friends is always fun."
Twilight Sparkle,Ohhhh...
Fluttershy,They're probably just as nervous as you are.
Applejack,You've been plannin' this shindig for weeks. You know everything about these fellers. It's gonna be dandy.
Twilight Sparkle,"[inhales] [exhales] You're right. Remember, Equestria and Yakyakistan haven't opened their borders for hundreds of moons. In fact, Yakyakistan is so far north of the Crystal Mountains, nopony's even been there! Imagine the look on Princess Celestia's face when she finds out we made friends with a yak prince! [nervous laugh] I'm calm! I'm calm..."
Prince Rutherford,"Ponies! Greetings, ponies!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Prince Rutherford, your Majesty. On behalf of all of us, I welcome you to Equestria."
Prince Rutherford,Me honored. Yaks hope for great friendship between ponies and yaks. [echoing] Friends for a thousand moons!
Twilight Sparkle,You must be hungry after a long journey.
Twilight Sparkle,We've prepared a banquet of traditional yak foods.
Prince Rutherford,"If things not perfect, yaks get mad. Yaks always get mad when things not perfect!"
Prince Rutherford,[sniffs] [chewing] [spits] This no taste like yak food! Fake pony food make yaks mad!
Pinkie Pie,Is it okay to be nervous now?
Applejack,"Them yaks sure have a funny way of sayin' ""howdy."""
Rarity,"They're different, that's all. Very... different."
Rainbow Dash,"I think they broke my record for most stuff broken in under a minute. I mean, they even broke the trophy."
Twilight Sparkle,"All we have to do is show them how great it can be to have friends before Princess Celestia arrives for the friendship party tonight. Now, who read the seven-volume cross-indexed history of Yakyakistan I recommended?"
Rainbow Dash,Um... I-I had a thing...
Applejack,"Pretty sure that's what fur's always for, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,I know! Yaks are so cool!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, can you show them around town? I know you have to plan the friendship party too, but it would really help make them feel welcome."
Pinkie Pie,Don't worry. They'll be in good hooves with me.
Twilight Sparkle,"Remember, we want to make sure Equestria feels like home. That means doing everything we can to make this place feel like Yakyakistan."
Pinkie Pie,No problem!
Twilight Sparkle,Good. Let's get out there and make some new friends!
Applejack,"We know y'all are noble warriors who avoid the so-called finer things, so me and my family would be honored if you rested here in the barn during your visit."
Pinkie Pie,Applejack and I made hay beds like you're used to back in Yakyakistan.
Prince Rutherford,Hmm... This perfect.
Pinkie Pie,"You can snooze here all afternoon, 'cause you're gonna need a lot of energy for my party tonight!"
Applejack,[sighs] That wasn't so hard.
Prince Rutherford,Wait! This not yak hay!
Pinkie Pie,"Well, we didn't have actual hay from Yakyakistan, but we tried our best to make it just like yours."
Prince Rutherford,Not perfect! Yaks destroy!
Applejack,"Pinkie Pie, what do we do?!"
Pinkie Pie,"And now, for your entertainment pleasure... Presenting animals, Yakyakistan style!"
Prince Rutherford,Animals cute.
Fluttershy,Oh. Thank goodness.
Prince Rutherford,Wait. These antlers lie! These not Yakyakistani animals! Yaks smash!
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, well... There's still other things we can do. I think."
Rarity,"Yes! These are some of my favorite materials. Very rare, imported from the Crystal Empire to match your northern sensibilities. I hope you'll find them<U+0097>"
Rarity,...delicious.
Prince Rutherford,This no taste like yak fabric! Yaks destroy!
Pinkie Pie,Everything's gonna be fine. You'll just... make it up to them. Somehow.
Pinkie Pie,"Listen up! Tell your faces to hold onto their frowns, 'cause they're about to get turned upside-down!"
Prince Rutherford,"Hold your frown, face!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hit it, Rainbow Dash!"
Pinkie Pie,"Just like Yakyakistan snow, right? Because snow is snow, no matter where it comes from."
Prince Rutherford,[slurp] This not yak snow!
Pinkie Pie,Seriously?! ...Seriously?
Applejack,Y'know... it's goin' okay.
Rarity,"Satisfactory, I'd say."
Rainbow Dash,It could be better.
Fluttershy,[whispering] It's not very good.
Pinkie Pie,It's a disaster!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, tonight's Yakyakistan theme party is more important than ever! You'll make them forget all about this afternoon, right? Because if it's not perfect, they're gonna smash everything! And I'm not sure how much more smashing this visit can take!"
Pinkie Pie,I definitely will! I think. Maybe...?
Applejack,You're the best gosh-darn party planner in Equestria.
Rainbow Dash,You'll show 'em a good time!
Fluttershy,You can do it!
Rarity,"We have absolute confidence in your abilities, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,It's going to be my most happy-tacular party ever! I hope!
Rainbow Dash,Why are your eyes darting around like that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, I don't know what we'd do without you<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,Me either! Gotta go!
Pinkie Pie,"[hyperventilating] Gummy, what am I gonna do? I had all this amazing stuff planned for the party, but they're gonna hate it! There's no way to make Equestria feel like Yakyakistan. They're just too sensitive! Even Fluttershy made them mad! Fluttershy! Oh... I need a new idea, and I need it now. How am I supposed to make this party feel like Yakyakistan without actually going there and bringing something back?!"
Twilight Sparkle,And this is Sugarcube Corner. They're working hard to make your traditional Yakyakistan cake.
Prince Rutherford,Vanilla extract balance very tricky.
Yaks,Uh-huh.
Twilight Sparkle,"Do you mind, um, waiting here for one moment?"
Twilight Sparkle,"How's tonight's party coming? I'm doing what I can, but it's really up to you at this point! ...Pinkie? Where are you?!"
Twilight Sparkle,[teeth chattering] Did you find her?
Fluttershy,"Angel and I searched the forest, but..."
Rainbow Dash,Aerial recon turned up nothing either.
Applejack,"I searched the farm inside and out. No Pinkie Pie. But I did find a set of Granny Smith's dentures under the house, so... not a complete loss."
Rarity,She's simply vanished!
Twilight Sparkle,But the party! It's all we have left! What are we gonna do?!
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""Don't worry. I'll be back in time for the party. Love, Pinkie Pie."" If Pinkie Pie says she'll be back in time for the party, she'll be back. We have to trust her. Right? [nervous laugh] No reason to freak out!"
Fluttershy,"Don't worry, Twilight."
Applejack,"When it comes to parties, I think she knows what she's doin'."
Twilight Sparkle,[inhales] [exhales] You're right. Let's just focus on keeping the yaks happy 'til she's back.
Rainbow Dash,Piece o' cake.
Twilight Sparkle,The cake!
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. One bite, and you'll be transported right back to Yakyakistan. [nervous laugh] I hope."
Prince Rutherford,[chewing] Hmm... Ponies too heavy on vanilla extract!
Twilight Sparkle,We've never needed a party so badly.
Conductor,"Next stop, Crystal Empire!"
Pinkie Pie,"And so my quest begins. I know what you're thinking. ""Why go to Yakyakistan alone, Pinkie Pie?"" Because I'm the party planner. This burden falls on my rump and my rump alone. If I want a great party, I gotta climb the mountains north of the Crystal Empire, find Yakyakistan, and come back with something authentic! Know what I mean?"
Pinkie Pie,Did we go the wrong way? Where's all the snow? Please tell me this is magical sand-colored snow. [spits] Nope. Sand. Definitely sand.
Conductor,"Dodge City. End of the line, I'm afraid. All trains had to stop. Sheep decided to sit on the tracks."
Pinkie Pie,"Curse you, sheep! Thanks for you help, conductor."
Pinkie Pie,Cherry Jubilee!
Cherry Jubilee,Pinkie Pie?! I reckoned I eyeballed you crossin' my way right now.
Pinkie Pie,How are you? You look amazing! I need help.
Cherry Jubilee,I'm dandy as a daffodil and fit as a floribunda. What can I do ya for?
Pinkie Pie,Have you heard of Yakyakistan? Do you have any idea how I can get there?
Cherry Jubilee,"Mark your calendar, missy, 'cause this right here's your lucky day! I'm headin' north to the Crystal Empire myself for a delivery. I ought to warn you though <U+0096> me and the boys are powerful tired 'cause we was up all night countin' cherries. Hey there! Wake up!"
Pinkie Pie,Counting cherries? How many?
Cherry Jubilee,"Four hundred and seventeen thousand, two hundred and thirty-four. Yee-haw!"
Pinkie Pie,Whoa!
Pinkie Pie,"And so my quest resumes. As I stare across the endless desert, I tell myself I will soon triumphantly enter the homeland of our noble guests and return with a prize to make the best party they've ever seen. Know what I mean?"
Pinkie Pie,Cherry? Ravine. Ravine!
Pinkie Pie,Wake up! Wake up! [grunting] Stooooop!
Cherry Jubilee,Huh?! [gasps] Whoa. I was dreamin' about a ravine. Ravine!
Pinkie Pie,That's what I said.
Prince Rutherford,Music beautiful. Much soul.
Twilight Sparkle,Phew!
Spike,"[sighs] When Twilight told me to stall<U+0097> I-I mean, entertain you, I thought there's no way I could<U+0097>"
Yaks,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,Spike!
Prince Rutherford,We demand party! Party now or yaks no friends!
Twilight Sparkle,No! Just a little longer!
Prince Rutherford,"No more longer! We leave now! Yak go to train, return with more yaks! We declare war!"
Twilight Sparkle,No Pinkie Pie? What's this?!
Applejack,Heh-heh. We panicked and tried to plan our own party.
Rainbow Dash,It's sort of panic-themed.
Twilight Sparkle,The yaks are going home! This is awful! I wanted to surprise Princess Celestia. Now the only surprise is that I may have just started a war.
Pinkie Pie,"There we were, face-to-face with Falling Pony Ravine. Down, down, down! And then, suddenly... Pow! We were rescued mid-air by the Wonderbolts! And then they gave me a ride to Manehattan, I joined a traveling band, we played some shows here and there, got popular, almost made it big until creative differences tore us apart. And that's when I knew I had to get back on with my journey to the Crystal Empire, the gateway to Yakyakistan! And so here I am. It was a major adventure that took most of the afternoon. Know what I mean?"
Princess Cadance,This is it. The northern boundary of the Crystal Empire. Beyond lies Yakyakistan. Nopony who's attempted this climb has ever returned. Are you sure you have to do this?
Pinkie Pie,I do.
Princess Cadance,"Good luck, Pinkie Pie."
Twilight Sparkle,How could she be so late to the party? This isn't like her.
Fluttershy,I'm sure she's trying her best.
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie Pie's tougher than she looks.
Pinkie Pie,"Hi! My name is Pinkie Pie! I'm looking for Yakyakistan. You know, faraway land, lots of yaks? Maybe you've heard of it?"
Pinkie Pie,Whoa-ho-ho! Slow down! I can't understand a word you're saying<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,[yelps] There it is! Yakyakistan!
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh. Is everypony alright?
Fluttershy,I can't tell if my eyes are open or closed.
Rainbow Dash,I think I can see a little bit.
Rainbow Dash,Gah! Nope.
Main cast sans Pinkie,Ooooh...
Applejack,Look at these! Pinkie Pie's made files for everypony in town!
Fluttershy,With exactly what kind of parties we like.
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie Pie has a secret party-planning cave?! How cool is this?!
Fluttershy,"[reading] ""Twilight Sparkle likes vanilla ice cream, red balloons, dancing..."""
Twilight Sparkle,That's right!
Fluttershy,"""But she's afraid of quesadillas."""
Twilight Sparkle,"No, I'm not! They're just so... [shudders] cheesy."
Pinkie Pie,"[fading in] ...oooooooo! No! I'm all the way back where I started! Gummy, I was this close to helping Twilight befriend the yaks. Now I've just let everypony down."
Pinkie Pie,Hmm?
Applejack,Looky here. It's notes for the party she wants to throw for her folks' fiftieth anniversary. But they ain't nearly that old! Huh. She's already plannin' their one-hundredth too. And their five-hundredth?
Twilight Sparkle,I had no idea she worked so hard on her parties.
Rainbow Dash,"She may be more organized than you, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,Let's not get carried away.
Rarity,I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work.
Pinkie Pie,[tearing up] Thank you! Thank you! I love you too! All of you!
Twilight Sparkle,You're back!
Pinkie Pie,"I tried to go to Yakyakistan so I could bring something back for my party. But at the last second, I made a mistake. [sighs] I worked harder on this party than any party ever. But I'm still just a big failure."
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you're not a failure."
Fluttershy,What matters is how hard you tried.
Rainbow Dash,Who else would've gone all across Equestria to plan one party?
Pinkie Pie,You know... the trip was really hard. But everypony I met along the way was so helpful. I just wish the yaks could see how friendly and wonderful and great Equestria really is! [gasps] I just got the best party idea ever!
Twilight Sparkle,It's too late. The yaks left on the last train.
Pinkie Pie,"Um, no, they didn't. [squeals] Trust me! There are a whole lot of sheep out there!"
Fluttershy,"So, um, do we walk back up the slide or... or what?"
Pinkie Pie,"I never thought I'd say this, but... thank you, sheep! And now, if it's okay with you, it's party time!"
Yaks,Ooh.
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Pinkie. This came together quick, even for you."
Pinkie Pie,"What can I say? I'm good at what I do. Prince Rutherford, every time we tried to make something in Equestria feel like Yakyakistan, we couldn't get it right. When I got back from my adventure, I realized something. We shouldn't try to make Equestria feel like your home. We should try to make you feel at home in Equestria. And that means showing you why we love it here, so you'll love it too."
Prince Rutherford,Pink pony work hard to make yaks feel at home. Now yaks happy. No declare war.
Prince Rutherford,Ponies and yaks... friends?
Pinkie Pie,For a thousand moons?
Prince Rutherford,For a thousand moons!
Princess Celestia,"I am very impressed, princess."
Twilight Sparkle,Heh. Just doing my best to spread friendship.
Princess Celestia,And you did a wonderful job of it. You and your friends.
Prince Rutherford,"Pink pony, you understand yaks now."
Pinkie Pie,"Aww, come here, you!"
Pinkie Pie,"[strained] Wow! Too strong! Okay, okay, okay!"
Spike,[sighs] You know the worst thing about you being the Princess of Friendship? The dishes.
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks for taking care of that, Spike. After three events in one week, I really needed to relax with a good book."
Spike,"It's kinda funny, isn't it? All these ponies comin' to you for advice about friendship?"
Twilight Sparkle,What's funny about that?
Spike,"You know, 'cause you used to be famous for being such a bad friend."
Twilight Sparkle,What are you talking about? I had good friends in Canterlot.
Spike,"Come on, Twilight. Look at the wall. D'ya see any photos from before we moved to Ponyville? And look at you now <U+0096> the Princess of Friendship."
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] This is a disaster! All my old friends! I can't remember any of their names right now! But do you really think that they think I'm a bad friend?!
Spike,"Well, I only meant that you've come so far. You're a great friend now and<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I feel terrible! I've gotta make it up to them! Pack a bag, Spike! We're going to Canterlot! And make a list of my friends' names."
Spike,Aw. Me and my big mouth.
Spike,"Come on, Twilight. You're getting worked up about nothin'."
Twilight Sparkle,The only logical place to start is at the beginning.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. It's exactly how we left it! [blows] Look! It's Predictions and Prophecies! And it's still open to the Elements of Harmony!
Spike,"And here's that present I was gonna give Moon Dancer! Huh. Guess she won't be needing that. Hey, look! The rest of it's still here!"
Twilight Sparkle,How could I have let this happen?
Spike,"Come on, Twilight. Princess Celestia gave you an assignment. Nopony could blame you for that."
Twilight Sparkle,But look at the way I left this place. It's a total mess! Just like how I left my friendships.
Twilight Sparkle,I've gotta make it up toooo... uh...
Spike,"Oh! Uh, Minuette, Twinkleshine, Lemon Hearts, Lyra Heartstrings, and Moon Dancer."
Twilight Sparkle,Yeah. Them.
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Come on! We've got work to do!
Spike,[groans] Have you been awake all night?
Twilight Sparkle,"I did a little research, and I think I know where we can find Minuette! That is one of my friends, right?"
Spike,"Uh, it's not too late to forget I opened my big mouth."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, Spike, I'm glad you opened your big mouth. These ponies have probably been suffering ever since I left. Wondering why their supposed friend would treat them so badly!"
Twilight Sparkle,Minuette?
Minuette,"Twilight Sparkle! [laughs] You old so-and-so! What are you doing here?! Hey, Spike! Look at these wings, huh?! [giggles] Hey, grab a picture of me and the princess, will ya?! I tried to tell my co-workers we used to be friends back when. [giggles] But they've never believed me!"
Minuette,"So what are you doing here? I mean, I know you're here all the time, but you never come to see me. Hey! I just had the greatest idea! You wanna go see Lemon Hearts and Twinkleshine?"
Twilight Sparkle,Of course! My old friends!
Twilight Sparkle,This is perfect! I can apologize to all three of them at once!
Spike,Let's hope they're not as traumatized as Minuette.
Minuette,She did! Twinkleshine literally spit out her oats when she heard you were the Princess of Friendship!
Twinkleshine,We saw you at the coronation. That was some shindig!
Twilight Sparkle,You did?
Twinkleshine,Sure! We see you all the time!
Minuette,"You remember our old friend, Lyra, right? [giggles] She lives in Ponyville too. We're always over there visiting her. Or she's coming over here! [giggles] We've thought about asking you to join us from time to time, but we just sorta figured you'd moved on."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh.
Lemon Hearts,"[clears throat] So what brings you by anyway? All those times you've come back to Canterlot, you never had donuts with us before."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, uh, you see... [sighs] I came to apologize."
Minuette,[gulps] For what?
Twilight Sparkle,"Before I left Canterlot, I didn't really appreciate my friends. And that's because I didn't know how important friendship was. But I've learned so much since I moved to Ponyville. I learned what it means to be a good friend and that I certainly wasn't one to the three of you. So for all the pain I caused you, I am truly sorry."
Minuette,"Oh, come on, Twilight! Sure, it might've stung a little bit when you ran off to Ponyville without saying goodbye, but it's not like we weren't used to that from you!"
Twinkleshine,"Yeah, we didn't take it personally."
Lemon Hearts,But it's really good to see you now. Hey! Anypony up for a blast from the past?
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] It's our old science lab! I have so many great memories of this place!
Minuette,[giggles] Remember when Lemon Hearts got her head stuck in that beaker?
Young Twilight Sparkle,"But according to this book, you're supposed to add the sodium chloride first."
Young Moon Dancer,"I read ahead, and to make a proper salt lick, you need to add the molasses first."
Young Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I read ahead too, Moon Dancer, and I'm sure it said sodium chloride first."
Young Moon Dancer,[dryly] Oh. I've got the wrong book. That's so hilarious.
Twilight Sparkle,Whatever happened to Moon Dancer?
Lemon Hearts,Moon Dancer?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, you know, our other friend."
Twinkleshine,"Oh, right! Moon Dancer! I remember her!"
Lemon Hearts,I wonder what she's up to.
Minuette,"Yeah, I always liked her. We just sort of lost touch after you left."
Twinkleshine,"I think she went to live out by the stadium, didn't she?"
Lemon Hearts,"Well, let's go see."
Minuette,"I think this is the place. Didn't used to look like this, though."
Twilight Sparkle,Moon Dancer?
Moon Dancer,What do you want? I'm trying to study.
Twilight Sparkle,It's us! Your old friends!
Moon Dancer,Ugh!
Twilight Sparkle,Exactly how I used to be.
Spike,"[sighs] Come on, Twilight! We've been watching her for three days! Library, house, library, house. That's it!"
Twilight Sparkle,Nopony looks at her or says hello or even gives her a smile. It's like she doesn't even exist. Was she always like this?
Minuette,"Well, she always was a little shy. But for a while there, she was really starting to come out of her shell. Remember when she threw that party? Oh, right. I think you might've been busy that day."
Twinkleshine,"There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on."
Minuette,"Thought she finally might be letting her guard down a little with that party. We invited her out a few times after that. But she was always too busy studying. So, eventually, we just stopped asking."
Twilight Sparkle,I had no idea that party was so important to her. I've gotta find a way to make it up to her!
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] [feigned surprise] Oh, my gosh! Moon Dancer?! Is that<U+0097>"
Ponies,Shh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Moon Dancer, can I talk to you for a min<U+0097>"
Moon Dancer,Shh! What is this?
Twilight Sparkle,"Eh, a bubble of silence. I haven't seen you in a while and I thought it might be nice to catch up."
Moon Dancer,For what purpose?
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, 'cause we're friends."
Ponies,Shhh!
Twilight Sparkle,I'm really sorry to bother you. I was just hoping we would go outside and talk for a bit.
Twilight Sparkle,[whispering] I'm sorry I skipped your party.
Moon Dancer,[growls] [whispering] Why won't you leave me alone? I'm trying to study! You've got the wrong pony! I don't have parties!
Twilight Sparkle,[whispering] You did once. And I was so caught up in my own studying that I didn't take your feelings into account.
Moon Dancer,"[whispering] Look, Twilight Twinkle<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,[whispering] Sparkle.
Moon Dancer,"[whispering] Whatever! I just need to be alone so I can study without some crazy pony trying to make friends, all right?!"
Twilight Sparkle,[whispering] Fine!
Moon Dancer,[whispering] Wait. How did you get into my book like that?
Twilight Sparkle,"I've been studying a new studying technique. I can only do it for a few minutes, but you'd be amazed how much you can pick up when you're actually in a book!"
Moon Dancer,It's one of Hayscartes' methods.
Twilight Sparkle,You know Hayscartes?
Moon Dancer,Of course! He's a genius!
Twilight Sparkle,"I have a copy of his Treatise on Ponies, you know."
Moon Dancer,What is this place?
Twilight Sparkle,"This is where I used to live. You mean, I never had you over?"
Moon Dancer,"Wow! A first edition of Principles of Magic! Hey, didn't I give this to you?"
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe?
Moon Dancer,"I did! Look, I even wrote something! ""To my friend, Twilight Sparkle. Thanks for introducing me to the classics."" I can see by the fact that you left it here that it meant a lot to you."
Twilight Sparkle,"Look, I didn't bring you over here for even more poignant reminders of what a bad friend I was. I brought you here to give you this. You can come here whenever you want and study to your heart's content."
Moon Dancer,Really?
Twilight Sparkle,"But first, you've gotta do something for me."
Moon Dancer,What?
Twilight Sparkle,Have dinner with our old friends tonight.
Moon Dancer,I can't. I'm reorganizing my biology scrolls.
Twilight Sparkle,"I've been spending a lot of time with Minuette, Twinkleshine, and Lemon Hearts since I've been back. They really miss you."
Moon Dancer,Look! I already told you! The last thing I need is a bunch of ridiculous friend-making keeping me from studying!
Twilight Sparkle,"Moon Dancer, wait! A wise pony once taught me that there's more to life than dusty old books!"
Moon Dancer,"I tried friendship and it's just not for me. Now, if you'll excuse me..."
Twilight Sparkle,What if I taught you Hayscartes' method?
Minuette,"So, uh, what are you studying these days?"
Moon Dancer,"Science, magic, history, economics, pottery. Things like that."
Minuette,Yowza! [chuckles] You planning on being a professor or something?
Moon Dancer,No.
Minuette,So you're just... studying.
Moon Dancer,Can I go now?
Twilight Sparkle,"Moon Dancer, please."
Minuette,"It's all right, Twilight. We're having a good time. Right, everypony?"
Minuette,"So, uh... Spike, tell Moon Dancer that story 'bout how Twilight had to read a book about doing a sleepover!"
Moon Dancer,Slumber 101? I've read that.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh! [chuckles] Really? Well, uh, did you know Lemon Hearts here works at the Canterlot palace?"
Lemon Hearts,"Uh, yeah. It's true. I do the big events mostly. State dinners, that sort of thing."
Moon Dancer,Ugh!
Twilight Sparkle,Moon Dancer! [teleportation zap] You've gotta give friendship a chance!
Moon Dancer,Dah! I gave friendship a chance a long time ago! It didn't work out then <U+0096> it isn't gonna work out now!
Spike,"Twilight, are you all right?"
Twilight Sparkle,"No. No, I'm not."
Spike,W-Where are you goin'?
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know, Spike. I really messed this one up. That party was everything to her. I can only imagine what it must've felt like when I didn't show up."
Minuette,"Hey, Moon Dancer! Look at this spread, huh?"
Moon Dancer,Thank you so much for coming!
Twinkleshine,Of course. We wouldn't miss one of our best friends' parties.
Moon Dancer,Is Twilight coming?
Moon Dancer,Oh. Okay.
Moon Dancer,Sure...
Twilight Sparkle,If there was only a way to undo the damage... I know what I need to do. And I know just who can help me.
Minuette,[knocks on door] Huh. Guess they must've gone back to Ponyville.
Pinkie Pie,Wheeeeeeeee!
Minuette,Huh?
Pinkie Pie,[laughing] Whoooooaaa!
Pinkie Pie,"That was awesome! We gotta go flying more often, Twilight!"
Minuette,There you are! [laughs] I thought you threw in the old towel and headed home!
Twilight Sparkle,"I did head home. But not to throw in the towel. I went to get my secret weapon. Minuette, meet<U+0097>"
Minuette,Hey! Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie,"Hi, Minuette! Twilight, you didn't say Minuette would be here!"
Twilight Sparkle,You two know each other?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, sure! She was one of Cadance's bridesmaids! We hang out all the time when she's in Ponyville! Didn't you know that? Ha! And you call yourself the Princess of Friendship! Twilight briefed me on the way here. We'll need fifteen bags of confetti and as many hooves as we can get."
Minuette,Let's go! We can pass by the donut place on the way!
Spike,And what are we gonna do?
Twilight Sparkle,Just come with me.
Moon Dancer,Ooh! A Brief History of the Wagon Harness! Huh? The Life and Times of Morari the Maneless?
Moon Dancer,What is this?
Twilight Sparkle,It's a party. For you.
Pinkie Pie,Surprise!
Twilight Sparkle,Come on in!
Moon Dancer,Thanks but no thanks. I don't do parties.
Twilight Sparkle,"I know. And I think it's my fault. Back when we were in school together, you invited me to a party. I was so focused on my studies that I didn't show up."
Moon Dancer,Big deal!
Twilight Sparkle,"It was a big deal. And now that I realize how important friendship is, I'd like to make up for my mistake with a new party. A party in honor of my friend Moon Dancer! Please, you've got to let me make this up to you."
Moon Dancer,"And you think this is gonna do it, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, yes?"
Twilight Sparkle,"You're right. This party can't make up for the way I hurt you. But please, don't let my mistake be the reason you can't be friends with anypony else."
Minuette,We were your friends then and we'd be honored to be your friends now.
Moon Dancer,"[sobs, sniffles] What? That's the librarian! The bookseller! My sister!"
Minuette,"You've got a lot of friends, Moon Dancer."
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Moon Dancer. I've faced magical creatures, the end of Equestria, all sorts of things. But seeing how my actions affected you, that was one of the worst feelings I've ever had."
Moon Dancer,"[sobs] Thank you, Twilight. I never realized how much I needed to hear that. Now come on, everypony! Let's party! Right?"
Pinkie Pie,Right!
All,YAAAAAAY!!!
Twilight Sparkle,"I think it's time for us to go, Moon Dancer."
Moon Dancer,Thank you for helping me make some new friends. Even if they are my old friends.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. We'll come back and visit soon.
Moon Dancer,That would be great! You've still gotta teach me that Hayscartes technique!
Twilight Sparkle,Deal.
Spike,"Um, Moon Dancer? It got kinda banged up, but here's a little something I wanted to give you back at your first party."
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Luna's turning into Nightmare Moon again!
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah? Well, we've got the cure for that!"
Princess Luna,[gasps] What? My dream ended... happily? That. Cannot. Happen!
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, this is amazing!"
Rainbow Dash,"[yawns] [tired throughout] Yeah, Rarity. Thanks for setting all this up."
Fluttershy,[tired throughout] A grooming day for our pets really was a great idea.
Rarity,"[tired throughout] Oh, my! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get my normal beauty sleep last night..."
Twilight Sparkle,[tired throughout] You know... [yawns] I didn't sleep well either.
Applejack,[tired throughout] Mm-hmm.
Rainbow Dash,Uh-huh.
Pinkie Pie,I'm totally beat too!
Applejack,"All right, Winona. Time for your brushin'."
Applejack,Oops. I guess I'm too plumb tuckered out to do this right.
Fluttershy,[yawns] I even went to bed early last night... but then I had a really scary nightmare.
Rest of main cast,Me too!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, only, you know, I didn't think mine was that scary!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, mine sure was. There was this blue smoke monster and... what?"
Fluttershy,I dreamt about a blue smoke thingy too!
Others,"Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Me too!"
Rainbow Dash,So what? Probably just a coincidence.
Twilight Sparkle,That's an awfully big coincidence.
Spike,Huh. I wonder why I didn't have that nightmare. I slept great!
Rarity,"So then, what could've given us all the same nightmare?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know, but I do know who might. Spike, could you send a scroll to Princess Luna?"
Spike,Sure! All set!
Twilight Sparkle,"Dear Princess Luna, last night my friends and I all dreamt of a creature made of blue smoke. I'm sure you're very busy, but [yawns] when you have the chance, please let me know if you have any idea what it could mean. Yours, [yawns] Princess Twilight Sparkle. You can leave out the yawns."
Princess Luna,Which of you saw the creature of blue smoke in your nightmare?!
Fluttershy,Wow. That was fast.
Twilight Sparkle,We all did.
Spike,Not me!
Others,"Applejack, [simultaneously] Ugh, we know!"
Twilight Sparkle,So you've encountered the smoke monster too?
Princess Luna,The Tantabus is a creature of my nightmares. It escaped from my slumbers yesterday.
Fluttershy,But how did it get into ours?
Princess Luna,The Tantabus is like a parasite. My dreams must no longer be enough for it. Now it seeks others to infect and corrupt. It must have learned of you six from seeing you in my dream.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, so Smokey gave us bad dreams. No biggie."
Princess Luna,"I saw that the Tantabus had grown more powerful, but I did not realize that power was enough to enable it to escape my dreams. If its power grows, it could very well find a way to escape into the real world. It could turn all of Equestria into a living nightmare!"
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, okay, okay, I take it back! That does sound bad! Really bad!"
Twilight Sparkle,We've prepared everything exactly as you requested.
Princess Luna,"Good. As you six slumber here, I will pursue the creature into whichever of your dreams it infests."
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! It'll be like a princess sleepover!
Twilight Sparkle,"Speaking of princesses, aren't you gonna ask Celestia for her help as well?"
Princess Luna,There is nothing my sister can do. She has no power in the realm of sleep. Only I can move from dream to dream. I am afraid nopony can help me tonight.
Applejack,Even us?
Princess Luna,Especially you. You have all suffered so much because of me. You need only slumber while I hunt the Tantabus in your dreams.
Spike,"I know you said nopony can help, but I'm no pony! I'm gonna stay up and watch over you guys just in case!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Aw, thank you, Spike!"
Applejack,[yawns] One good thing about not sleepin' well last night <U+0096> shouldn't be too hard to fall asleep now.
Rarity,"Oh, my! [gasps] This is simply divine! How avant garde!"
Princess Luna,It is here!
Rarity,[gasps] It was such a pretty little chiffon...! What kind of monster would do this?!
Princess Luna,The Tantabus.
Rarity,Then let's stop it!
Princess Luna,"No, please! I don't want you to suffer anymore because of me. I will catch it."
Princess Luna,"It has jumped into another dream! I am sorry, but if I am to stop it, I must follow it where you cannot."
Rarity,Go! I should be able to handle things here. [gulps] I hope...!
Pinkie Pie,"La-la-la-la-la! Whee! Whee, ha-ha!"
Pinkie Pie,La-la-la-la-la!
Princess Luna,I followed the Tantabus here. Now I need only find<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"Sorry, can't help it! An idea pops into my head, it<U+0097> [gasps] Ooh, cake!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ew, cake!"
Princess Luna,[inhales] [grunts] No!
Pinkie Pie,Sorry!
Pinkie Pie,Who wants ice cream?!
Fluttershy,"Mmm, it's so nice to be the pet for once."
Fluttershy,"N-n-n-n-nice... giant... evil Angel...! [screams] Phew! Oh, thank you, princess!"
Applejack,[sighs] Now this is what I call an incredible dream.
Princess Luna,I can see the Tantabus has already turned your slumbers into a nightmare!
Rainbow Dash,What are you talking about? This is my favorite dream!
Rainbow Dash,Hyah!
Twilight Sparkle,Luna!
Spike,What happened? Are you guys okay?
Fluttershy,That... that was terrible! I-I never want to have that nightmare again!
Rainbow Dash,[shivers] Me either!
Spike,"But Luna caught it, didn't she?"
Princess Luna,"I am so sorry, my friends. I failed. It will be back to infect your dreams the next time you sleep."
Fluttershy,"Oh, no!"
Applejack,Yeah. I reckon I could live without seeing that thing ever again.
Princess Luna,"But you will. Again and again, every night, until it grows powerful enough to infect the waking world! After what I did as Nightmare Moon, the fact that I am once again responsible for harming others is more than I can bear."
Pinkie Pie,It'll be okay! Everypony makes mistakes!
Princess Luna,"As long as none of you dreamt about another pony, the Tantabus remains confined to your dreams. I still have a chance to catch it before it's too late."
Pinkie Pie,"Phew, that's good to hear! Although after you left, I did happen to dream that I was eating a giant ice-cream cone with all of Ponyville while taking a test we hadn't studied for. See, what'd I tell ya? Everypony makes mistakes!"
Twilight Sparkle,But that means the Tantabus could be turning every dream in Ponyville into a nightmare!
Princess Luna,It is far worse than that. Infecting all those dreams gives it more and more power. Soon it will be able to escape into the real world and infect Equestria with its nightmare plague!
Rarity,Then you must let us help you stop it before that happens!
Fluttershy,But how? The Tantabus was able to escape Luna when it only had six dreams it could get to!
Princess Luna,"It is true. With so many dreams to hide in, I do not know how I can catch it."
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm... What if everypony in Ponyville were having one dream?
Princess Luna,"I... can create shared dreams, yes, but for so many ponies at once? I have never done anything like that. The amount of power it would take..."
Fluttershy,"Well, it is worth a try, isn't it?"
Princess Luna,"Of course. I will do anything to end this, including accept your help. I cannot allow the Tantabus to escape into the real world. All of you must now go back to sleep and hope that I can create such a dream."
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Princess Luna did it!
Applejack,"[shivers] Big Mac! Boy, I'm glad to see somethin' familiar!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Princess Luna,Ponies!
Ponies,Princess Luna!
Princess Luna,"There is no time for bowing, my friends! There is something coming, something terrible! No, it is already here!"
Princess Luna,I am so sorry! I brought this upon you! But I will end it now!
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess, what's wrong?"
Princess Luna,[grunts] It... is taking all my strength just to hold this massive dream together! You will have to stop it! I truly wish I did not have to ask this of you!
Twilight Sparkle,Then you're in luck.
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! We're already on it!
Filthy Rich,[yelping] Please! I'll pay you anything!
Rainbow Dash,I got you!
Applejack,"Oh, no!"
Applejack,"Big Mac! You can do anythin' in a dream, remember?"
Rainbow Dash,"Come on! If that Tantabus thing turns any more of this dream against us, we'll be too busy saving ponies to catch it! And it'll grow powerful enough to escape into the real world!"
Applejack,How are we even gonna know when it's able to escape?
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, I think we'll know."
Princess Luna,"[straining] Hurry, my friends!"
Rainbow Dash,What the?!
Fluttershy,"Please, we need your help too!"
Twilight Sparkle,Fluttershy's right! We've all got to work together to stop it from escaping!
Mr. Cake,Mr. But how can we help? Nopony in Ponyville has your magic or your speed!
Rainbow Dash,That's true... in Ponyville!
Applejack,But this here isn't Ponyville! It's a dream!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Twilight Sparkle,"And not just any! This is your dream! Anything you can do in your dreams, you can do now!"
Spike,"[clicks fingers] Well, if you're gonna dream, might as well dream big, right? Hi-yah!"
Derpy,Whoo!
Rainbow Dash,It's working!
Twilight Sparkle,But it's not enough!
Pinkie Pie,"Then do more! This is a dream, remember?"
Princess Luna,[straining] I cannot hold this dream together much longer! Equestria will fall because of me!
Spike,"Am I crazy, or did it just get even bigger after Luna said that?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I think it's feeding off your guilt, Princess Luna!"
Princess Luna,"If that is so, then perhaps that is how it grew strong enough to escape in the first place!"
Applejack,Say what now?!
Princess Luna,I created the Tantabus to give myself the same nightmare every night... [pants] ...to punish myself for the evil I caused as Nightmare Moon!
Fluttershy,But why would you do that?!
Princess Luna,"To make sure I never forgave myself for how much Equestria suffered because of me! But it seems I have not learned my lesson, for now I have only made you suffer more!"
Twilight Sparkle,But that means you might just be the key to stopping all this!
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! If it gets strong because you feel bad about what you did as Nightmare Moon, then you just gotta stop feeling bad for what you did!"
Princess Luna,How can I forgive myself? I am no better now than I was then. My creation is about to turn the world into a living nightmare!
Twilight Sparkle,"But look at what you're doing! Nightmare Moon would've wanted the Tantabus to turn Equestria into a nightmare! You're doing everything you can to stop it! Don't you see? That proves you're not the same pony you were then! Everypony who knows you knows that Nightmare Moon is in the past! We all trust you, Luna! Do you trust us enough to believe we're right?"
Princess Luna,...I do!
Princess Luna,Thank you. Thank you all.
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Luna did it!
Applejack,She sure did! Only... I'm not exactly sure what she did.
Twilight Sparkle,"Luna created the Tantabus to punish herself! The worse she felt, the more power it had! But once she finally forgave herself for what Nightmare Moon did..."
Spike,Poof!
Fluttershy,Shh!
Spike,Huh. Wonder what she's dreaming about now.
Rarity,[gasps] Was that the Pony Post?!
Rarity,"Oh, it's just you, Opal."
Rarity,Ohhh... Every other day he's here like clockwork! Not today! What could possibly be holding him up?!
Pinkie Pie,[muffled] Strawberry cinnamon cilantro salutations!
Rarity,What?
Pinkie Pie,"What indeed. I bet you're wondering what warrants such a welcome! Well, that welcome is warranted by a pony that whisked up a warm batch of strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcakes!"
Pinkie Pie,[chomp] That strangely sickening flavor combination sounds just as bad as it tastes. [gulps] Ugh. So I came here to offer you some!
Rarity,"After that visually descriptive and disturbing endorsement, I'll pass."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, I almost forgot! I have this letter for you, Rarity! The post pony was going to deliver it, but after a strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcake, he was feeling kinda queasy. And since I was heading over anyway, I figured I could do it for him! Here you go!"
Pinkie Pie,[with mouth full] What's it say?
Rarity,I got it!
Pinkie Pie,Woo-hoo! Got what?
Rarity,"Oh, I have been holding out for the perfect location, and it finally became available! So now I can fulfill my dream of opening a boutique in Canterlot!"
Twilight Sparkle,Rarity's such a savvy businesspony. I'm so impressed she used the huge bonus she earned making the costumes for Sapphire Shores' Equestria-wide tour to open this second boutique!
Rarity,I take it from your reaction that you like the boutique?
Fluttershy,It's lovely.
Applejack,"Gosh, Rarity. I know hard work when I see it, and it looks like you worked your hooves to the nub!"
Pinkie Pie,I don't know. Those hooves don't look nubby. They look scrubbied and buffied and pedied!
Rarity,"Well, despite my 'nubby scrubby buffy pony pedi, I actually have been working very hard! However, I never could have gotten the boutique ready for the grand opening without the help of my new manager Sassy Saddles!"
Sassy Saddles,"Bust my buttons, Rarity! The ponies from Ponyville!"
Rarity,"I knew I needed a manager for Canterlot Carousel, so when Sassy showed me her resum<e9> and I saw that she worked in all of the finest boutiques in Canterlot, I hired her right on the spot!"
Sassy Saddles,"I then laid out this plan, or ""pattern"" as we say in the fashion biz, for Canterlot Carousel so that Rarity's boutique will be a guaranteed success and those doors will never, ever, ever close!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Sassy. Your attention to detail is truly impressive."
Sassy Saddles,I've already put a pin in the first piece of the pattern <U+0096> Beautify the Boutique! But next was the very crucial pattern piece <U+0096> Marketing to the Mares! Turns out that everypony here loves royalty!
Rarity,So I created a collection that beautifully revolves around the royal element of Canterlot!
Sassy Saddles,And it just so happens there's a hot new princess in Equestria!
Rarity,"[to Twilight] In every poll Sassy Saddles took, you were the most popular princess! Coincidentally, one of my gowns is inspired by the window in Canterlot Castle commemorating your coronation!"
Rarity,"While I've always prided myself on paying attention to detail, I've taken my latest collection to a whole new level with ""Rarity's Rules of TLC""!"
Pinkie Pie,"Judging by this baby, TLC stands for Tasty Liquorice Candy!"
Rarity,"TLC stands for 'Time, Love, and Couture'. And while I do agree that this dress has potential, I've not had enough time to give it enough love to become couture."
Rarity,But the rest of the gowns in tonight's line have met Rarity's Rules and are ready to be presented!
Sassy Saddles,My marketing research also confirmed that customers that viewed somepony famous wearing a gown wish to own that gown for themselves. I call this piece of the pattern Celebrity Status!
Rarity,"So, Twilight, we were wondering if perhaps you might possibly wear this tonight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"If being a princess and wearing that dress can help your boutique in any way, then I say stick a pin in it. It's done."
Sassy Saddles,"Alright, everypony! Let's set the stage!"
Rarity,"Ever since I was a little filly, all I've ever wanted was to own a boutique here in Canterlot. Somepony pinch me! I'm about to open the doors to that very boutique!"
Sassy Saddles,Welcome to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel!
Applejack,"That Sassy totally stepped on your hooves, Rarity."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, no! Did she mess up that nice pony pedi?! [sighs] Okay. Phew!"
Rarity,"Oh, I don't think she meant to."
Sassy Saddles,"Rarity, are you ready to reveal the collection?"
Applejack,[under her breath] Is she sure she doesn't wanna do it herself?
Rainbow Dash,[snorts] [under her breath] Yeah.
Rarity,"Yes, I am. Fluttershy, could you help Twilight get ready?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, certainly."
Rarity,"Fillies and gentlecolts! I am designer and couturier Rarity, I'd like to welcome you <U+0096> again [laughs nervously] <U+0096> to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel, and I'm thrilled that you are here to see my newest collection inspired by this regal city!"
Fashion Plate,"Rarity, I'm<U+0097>"
Rarity,Fashion Plate of Cosmare magazine! I'm so honored that Cosmare was able to do a piece on the grand opening of my boutique!
Fashion Plate,"Well, when Sassy Saddles calls, saying she's found the latest and greatest in fashion, we hightail without fail! Now tell me all about your latest collection!"
Rarity,"Oh, uh, it's called ""Rarity's Royal Regalia""."
Fashion Plate,[gasps] Royally radiant!
Rarity,"My favorite part of being a designer is finding my inspiration, and that really wasn't difficult when it came to Canterlot. Everywhere I looked, the royal city just spoke to me! I call it ""In-spire-ation""."
Fashion Plate,Genius! Simply genius!
Rarity,"I spent hours by the lily pond on the castle grounds, which inspired this gown <U+0096> ""Water Filly""!"
Fashion Plate,"Oh, the whimsy!"
Rarity,"Watching Celestia raise the sun each morning literally lit up my day... [beat] This is ""Tripping the Light""."
Fashion Plate,Fantastic!
Rarity,"[giggles] And of course, Luna raising the moon guided me to sleep. I call this ""Over the Moon""!"
Fashion Plate,"Well, I certainly am!"
Rarity,"And for our finale, I have something very special. I was inspired by the stained glass window created in honor of Princess Twilight... I call this ""The Reign in Stain""!"
Fashion Plate,Because the dress is inspired by the<U+0097>
Fashion Plate and Rarity,<U+0097>stained glass window of a reigning princess!
Rarity,Yes!
Sassy Saddles,"Oh, well, I think ""The Reign in Stain"" is too difficult to explain! [short laugh] Especially for the signature piece of a collection?"
Rarity,But I rather like the<U+0097>
Sassy Saddles,"Fillies and gentlecolts, I, Sassy Saddles, am pleased to introduce the grand finale of the grand opening of Rarity's Royal Regalia <U+0096> the ""Princess Dress""!"
Fashion Plate,[gasps] Success!
Sassy Saddles,"Everypony, please follow me and you can all place your orders for the Princess Dress!"
Twilight Sparkle,Yeah! Rarity's Royal Regalia is amazing! And everypony seemed to love the Princess Dress!
Sassy Saddles,You bet your saddle they did. Rarity now has one hundred orders for her signature gown!
Rarity,[stammers] One hundred orders?! All at one time?!
Sassy Saddles,"According to my pattern, the next piece is The Success of the Signature Dress, so I do not see the problem!"
Applejack,Uh...
Pinkie Pie,Cupcake?
Rarity,"[clears throat] First of all, Sassy Saddles, I would have appreciated getting to name the final gown from my collection myself."
Sassy Saddles,"[short laugh] My research shows that your ""Reign in Stain"" name was a play on words that was both very confusing and quite unappealing."
Rarity,"[disgruntled laugh] While I see your point, we should have discussed it prior to the grand opening, Sassy."
Sassy Saddles,"My only goal is for Canterlot Carousel to succeed. That's why I changed the name, and that is why I took all those orders for the Princess Dress."
Rarity,"[stammering] But... But receiving orders for one hundred dresses in one day, [stammering] it's just too much too soon!"
Sassy Saddles,Are you actually saying we should... cancel these orders?!
Rarity,"Wha... But... [stammering] Uh, n-no, Sassy. Promises were made, and I shall sew my very best to provide each and every pony a Princess Dress full of TLC."
Sassy Saddles,"Oh, thank you, Rarity, thank you!"
Sassy Saddles,"Oh, satin and silk, Rarity, are you sure you don't want your friends to help you make the dresses?"
Rarity,"No, Sassy. These orders are my responsibility. All I have to do is stick to my plan so I can deliver each and every Princess Dress in keeping with my Rules of Rarity!"
Rarity,"The rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality This I can assure For each and every dress I vow to give finesse With time, love, and couture"
Others,"My favorite moment's when a pony sees it That special gown that she just adores That pony's now in style My hard work's all worthwhile Oh, yes, it makes my heart My heart just soar"
Others,"Oh, to create would give me elation To feel once again some inspiration Come on now, Rarity Give me some clarity Time for your couture love to rule"
Others,"The rules of Rarity, extra TLC This feels more sublime Soon now, they will see how good these can be With a little extra shine"
Rarity,Is that the customer who ordered this Princess Dress?
Sassy Saddles,I'll take care of her. You keep working.
Rarity,"Uh, actually, I'd love to see her reaction to this particular dress."
Sassy Saddles,"Paisley and poplin, Rarity, look at all the orders you still have to finish, and you want to take a break? Now?"
Rarity,"Well, it's just I made some really lovely changes to this dress<U+0097>"
Sassy Saddles,You did what?! But every Princess Dress is supposed to be exactly the same!
Rarity,"Yes yes I know, but these gems just spoke to me, and<U+0097>"
Sassy Saddles,Fine. Go see her reaction.
Rarity,"Hello, and welcome to Canterlot Carousel! I am so pleased to present to you your<U+0097>"
Others,"""Cayenne"": Princess Dress! Finally! I've been simply desperate to get this ever since I saw Princess Twilight wearing it on your<U+0097> ...Wait a minute. There's something different."
Rarity,"Well as an artiste, I did take the liberty to change a few minor details."
Rarity,"I, eheh, I saw these gems glistening in the light, and they just spoke to me. Aren't they lovely? And so unique!"
Others,"""Cayenne"": [sigh] They're... fine. But they're not what I ordered, are they?"
Rarity,"Uh, no. No, they're not."
Others,"""Cayenne"": I want the dress to be exactly like the one Princess Twilight wore. Understand?"
Rarity,"Yes... Y-Yes, of course."
Rarity,"The rules of Rarity Once stood for something But now it feels just like some factory Now every dress I make With every flaw and mistake Oh, how it makes my heart My heart just break"
Sassy Saddles,"Raving rick-rack, Rarity! You made two hundred Princess Dresses!"
Rarity,[deadpan] Yes. Isn't it spectacular?
Sassy Saddles,And I have a special surprise for you! The latest issue of Cosmare magazine just hit the stands!
Rarity,"[reading] ""Canterlot's newest rising star""?"
Sassy Saddles,"And in the hour since the magazine's come out, we've gotten another hundred new orders for the Princess Dress!"
Rarity,[weakly] One... hundred more... Princess Dresses?! I'm the Cosmare cover pony... I have the most successful shop in Canterlot... I've gotten everything I ever wanted... but I'm miserable!
Sassy Saddles,"[short laugh] How could you possibly be miserable? My pattern is perfect! Cosmare Cover Pony <U+0096> done! You have your signature gown, the Princess Dress of Success!"
Rarity,I don't want to make another hundred Princess Dresses!
Sassy Saddles,I have a piece for that! Assemble the Assembly Line! You'll never have to sew again!
Rarity,What?! No!
Sassy Saddles,Yes! Then the Canterlot Carousel never closes! And Sassy Saddles' boutique succeeds!
Rarity,"Stop! This is not your boutique! And if this is what success in Canterlot looks like, I want no part of it! Now, make up flyers for a going-out-of-business sale! I'm closing Canterlot Carousel!"
Sassy Saddles,"What?! No! Oh, you can't, Rarity! I-I've worked too hard to make this a success! I can't be a part of another failed boutique!"
Rarity,"[to a dress] Oh, don't you look lovely? Nice to see you out here again. [to herself, hushed] Seems Sassy Saddles isn't rushing to open the door this time. Hm."
Rarity,Welcome to the going-out-of-business sale of Canterlot Carousel.
Pretzel,"Hey, is this Princess Dress on sale?"
Rarity,"Oh, no, I'm sorry, the Princess Dress has been discontinued. But there are plenty of other lovely dresses on sale today."
Others,"""Moonlight Raven"": [flatly] Whoa. This dress completely speaks to my soul. Can I try it on?"
Rarity,Certainly. The dressing area is right back there.
Others,"""Sunshine Smiles"": This is the most amazing of amazing dresses! Just looking at it brightens my day!"
Rarity,And I'm sure you'll feel even brighter once you try it on!
Others,"""North Point"": Do you still have this In-spire-ation dress that's in the new issue of Cosmare?"
Rarity,"Oh, yes, I do. It's-It's right here."
Others,"""North Point"": Bats in the belfry! I have to try it on!"
Others,"""Moonlight Raven"": [flatly] Whoa. This dress makes me feel like a princess."
Others,"""Sunshine Smiles"": And this dress makes me feel like a princess!"
Others,"""Citrus Blush"": This gown is quite beautiful, but it totally clashes with my complexion."
Rarity,"Hmmm. Perhaps you'd be even more taken with this one. It was inspired by the fountain in the Canterlot Castle garden. I call it the ""Fountain of Truth""!"
Others,"""Citrus Blush"": It's exactly what I've been dreaming of!"
Rarity,"Oh! Well, then I'll finish it, and the gown shall be yours! [to herself] How can I have forgotten? This is what I've been dreaming about!"
Rarity,"My favorite moment's when a pony sees it That special gown that she just adores That pony's now in style My hard work's all worthwhile Oh, yes, it makes my heart My heart just soar!"
Rarity,"Attention, everypony! Canterlot Carousel will not be closing!"
Others,"""Moonlight Raven"": [flatly] But this stuff's still on sale, right?"
Rarity,"[giggles] Yes, yes, of course."
Sassy Saddles,"Oh, Rarity, I'm so sorry. I focused on that one dress, and the rest of Rarity's Royal Regalia paid the price."
Rarity,"Well, so did the Princess Dress. The more I sold, the more each dress lost its time, love, and couture, becoming terrible, lackluster, and common."
Sassy Saddles,I think I finally understand the Rules of Rarity... and will apply them at my next job.
Rarity,I beg your pardon? The Rules of Rarity are only to be applied at Canterlot Carousel! Which is why you must continue to manage the boutique while I'm in Ponyville.
Sassy Saddles,Ponyville?
Rarity,"Well, yes, I'll come to Canterlot with new designs and to see the customers of course, but Ponyville was always going to be my home base."
Sassy Saddles,"[gasps] Bobbins and bodkins, Rarity! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! And I promise to run everything following your rules."
Rarity,I would expect nothing less.
Others,"""Whoa Nelly"": Oh, my gosh, a sale! Do you have the Princess Dress?!"
Rarity,"Oh, Sassy Saddles, don't you just love my new Femme Mystique Chic line of gowns?"
Sassy Saddles,"[gasps] Sequins and sashes, Rarity, they're exquisite! Where in Equestria did you find the inspiration?"
Rarity,"Oh, I modeled them after the adventures of Shadow Spade. Her stories are always full of mystery and suspense and, best of all... fabulous costumes!"
Sassy Saddles,They're perfect! [beat] What are you doing?
Rarity,"[humming] Oh, uh, just making some minor adjustments. [blows on dress] Shadow Spade believes it all comes down to attention to detail. And so do I. There! Now it's perfect."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey guys, how's it<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,[nervous laughing] My bad.
Rainbow Dash,[groans] Sorry I messed up your dress thingy.
Sassy Saddles,Nothing we can't fix in a stitch. What are you doing in Canterlot?
Rainbow Dash,I'm here for Princess Celestia's royal garden opening tomorrow.
Sassy Saddles,"Oh, yes! Rumor has it the gardens are especially lush this season. I heard that the Wonderbolts will be kicking things off with an aerial display."
Rarity,You heard right. And Rainbow Dash is here to fly with them. So exciting!
Rainbow Dash,"Well, kind of exciting. Technically, I'm not flying. I'm just the lucky Reserve who was called in to be the backup flyer in case a Wonderbolt can't perform."
Rarity,"Oh, don't be so modest. Out of all the Reserves, you were the one chosen."
Rainbow Dash,"It is pretty sweet. And I do get to stay in the castle, hang out with the Wonderbolts, and eat awesome food at the dinner tonight. Speaking of the dinner, you're still coming, right?"
Rarity,"Heavens, yes! A chance to dress up, be charming and show off my newest femme mystique couture? I wouldn't miss it for all of Equestria."
Rainbow Dash,Great! See ya tonight!
Rarity,"Ooh, the rhinestones I ordered! [beat] Oh, my. Oh, there's been a mistake... I ordered dragon-cut stones, and these are hoof-polished."
Others,"""Package Deal"": I'm sorry, but I've got a full load of deliveries today. I'm not sure I have time to redo your order."
Rarity,"Of course you don't. Your job is so difficult. Honestly, I don't know how you keep all of those orders straight."
Others,"""Package Deal"": [chuckle] It is pretty tough, what with the boxes all being... box-shaped."
Rarity,"Oh, y<U+0097>oh yes, and I very much appreciate it. But if there was any way you could squeeze in one more little delivery, I would be eternally grateful."
Others,"""Package Deal"": [laughs nervously] Well, for you, Rarity, I'll see what I can do."
Sassy Saddles,"Rarity, you could sweet-talk a filly out of candy!"
Rarity,"Oh, [chuckles], it was nothing. Nopony minds a compliment. Now, you simply must help me pick out an outfit for tonight. Something from the new collection, of course."
Rainbow Dash,Let's grab some grub!
Rarity,"[sniffs] Mm, is that Juniper Phoenix I smell?"
Wind Rider,"Yeah, Juniper Phoenix is one of my favorite stallion colognes."
Rarity,"Oh, mine as well. It's masculine and yet<U+0097>"
Rarity,<U+0097>soft with the barest hint of floral notes and<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,[hushed] Rarity! Don't you know who this is?!
Rarity,A gentlepony with fabulous taste in colognes and scarves?
Rainbow Dash,It's Wind Rider!
Rarity,Oh! So nice to meet you!
Rainbow Dash,You didn't let me finish! He's a living legend. He holds the Wonderbolt record in the Mustang Marathon!
Wind Rider,"Well, that was a long time ago. Honestly, I can't believe I still hold the record."
Spitfire,"Wind Rider, I see you met Rainbow Dash! She's one of our most promising Reserves. She just might beat your record."
Wind Rider,Really now?
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, heh, I'm nowhere near as good as you. I mean, I'm fast, but I don't have the endurance to go long distances."
Spitfire,"Ah, don't be modest. A little practice and you'll be beating records in no time."
Wind Rider,"Heh-heh. Well, it's nice to meet you fillies."
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Not as nice as it is to meet you, sir. [barely-contained laughter] I can't believe I just met Wind Rider!"
Misty Fly,"Yeah, he's coming out of retirement to take the spot of honor in the center of our aerial flower formation tomorrow."
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] Really? That's incredible! Guess I'll just watch Wind Rider being awesome from the sidelines... Practice tomorrow is gonna be so boring.
Rarity,I don't suppose I could keep you company?
Rainbow Dash,You could! They always let friends and family come watch practices!
Rarity,"Mm, ooh!"
Rarity,"Uh, no-no, it's almost impossible to get stains out of silk. But not to worry. I've come prepared!"
Rarity,"That dinner was absolutely divine. Thanks for inviting me! Ooh, you're staying in the east tower? Those rooms have the best view of Canterlot!"
Spitfire,"How lucky are we? Well, we better get some shuteye before practice."
Rainbow Dash,"See you tomorrow, Rarity!"
Rarity,Good night!
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Thanks for keeping me company, Rarity. If you weren't here, well, I don't know who I'd be talking to right now."
Soarin,"Eh, you'd be talkin' to me. Rainbow Dash, Spitfire's mom sent a message that she was sick. She had to leave to take care of her."
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps] Oh, no! I hope her mom's okay!"
Soarin,"Me too. In the meantime, we need you to fly in her place."
Rainbow Dash,"L-Like, in the actual show?"
Soarin,"Unless Spitfire comes back, yes."
Rainbow Dash,"I won't let you down, Soarin! [squeals] This is the best thing ever! Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh! [sing-song] I'm gonna get to fly with Wind Rider and the Wonderbolts, 'cause I'm the bestest and I'm awesome and they know it! [continues under] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh..."
Soarin,Uh... Rainbow Dash?
Rarity,"[hushed] Shh! Let her have this, darling."
Rarity,Hello there! Friend or family?
Stormy Flare,"Family. My daughter's a Wonderbolt, but I don't see her up there. Do you know Spitfire?"
Rarity,"Ooh, you're Spitfire's mum? But I thought you were sick."
Stormy Flare,What?
Rarity,"Well, Spitfire got a note from you saying you weren't feeling well, and she went home to take care of you."
Stormy Flare,I didn't send a note.
Rarity,That's so strange.
Soarin,"Stormy Flare? Aren't you supposed to be sick? 'Kay, what's happening?"
Stormy Flare,I don't know. But I do know I didn't send my daughter a note.
Rarity,Could somepony have sent Spitfire a fake note?
Misty Fly,Who would do such a thing?
Soarin,"Somepony who wanted her out of the show, I suppose."
Rainbow Dash,Why would anypony want that?
Wind Rider,Maybe so they could take her spot.
Rainbow Dash,Me?! I would never do that to Spitfire! Why would you think it was me?
Blaze,I did see you and Spitfire leave the dinner together.
Rainbow Dash,We were room neighbors in the castle!
Misty Fly,And you did say you'd do anything to fly with Wind Rider.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, but I didn't mean anything."
Soarin,Spitfire came by my room and told me she had to go see her mom at around midnight. Where were you then?
Rainbow Dash,"I was asleep at midnight... having this totally amazing dream. There I was at the arena flying with Wind Rider and the Wonderbolts, like I've always wanted to<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,"<U+0097>ah, eh, never mind. Not helping."
Soarin,"Rainbow Dash, if you can prove that somepony else is behind Spitfire's disappearance before the start of the show, then you can still fly with us. In the meantime, Misty Fly, Blaze, head over to Stormy Flare's house and try to find Spitfire and bring her back. [to Rainbow Dash] I have to warn you, if you sent that letter, the bylaws are clear. I'd have no choice but to ban you from the Wonderbolts forever. Understand?"
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I understand. But how am I gonna prove I didn't send a letter that I didn't send?
Rarity,"With me! Detective Rarity is on the case, and we are going to get to the bottom of this faster than my costume change!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, what's with the getup?"
Rarity,"Obviously, I am channeling Shadow Spade through these gorgeous garments, and she would say that the best way to prove that you didn't send the letter is to find out whoever did. First stop <U+0096> the scene of the crime!"
Rarity,"[narrating] We had a long road ahead of us, Rainbow Dash and I. Well, not too long because we didn't have much time, but the point is... I was up for the challenge."
Rarity,"[narrating] There I was, surveying the crime scene, and looking tr<e8>s chic while doing it. [normally] This must be the envelope for the letter Spitfire got! [sniffs] Hmm. These look like hairs from a rainbow mane!"
Rainbow Dash,[gulps] That's not good.
Rarity,"[narrating] Rainbow Dash was getting antsy, but I had faith I could clear her name and find the real culprit."
Rainbow Dash,What are you doing?
Rarity,"[stammers] Uh, just thinking thoughts. [narrating] Rainbow Dash was right. In order to solve the mystery, we had to be focused. Driven. One hundred percent in the<U+0097> [normally] Ooh! The damask pattern on these curtains is exquisite! Oh, and this velvet rope-holder <U+0096> oh, it's just<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,We don't have time to look at the d<e9>cor! They're gonna kick me out of the Wonderbolts unless we solve this thing!
Rarity,"I know, Rainbow, and I'm on this case like a charm on a bracelet! Here's what I'm thinking: somepony had to bring Spitfire that letter, which means somepony must have seen them!"
Rarity,"I just have a few questions for you, and I'm sure once we get some things cleared up, we'll<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Rarity, we don't have all day! [to a guard] Where were you on the night of last night at midnight?!"
Castle Guard 1,"We were here, guarding the hallway entrance like we were supposed to."
Rainbow Dash,A likely story.
Castle Guard 1,"I'm telling you, we were there all night, and no one went in or out of that hallway."
Spearhead,Except for you.
Rainbow Dash,What are you tryin' to say?!
Spearhead,Just that there are only two rooms in the northwest wing: yours and Spitfire's. So the only other pony who had access to that wing was you.
Rarity,"[narrating] The waters were getting choppy. Rainbow Dash's tactics were, well, horrid. It was time for another approach. [normally] Perhaps I should take it from here! You castle guards have such a difficult job. I'm guessing that at times it can be rather... boring."
Castle Guard 1,It is. I've counted all three hundred and forty five bolts in the ceiling tiles two hundred and ninety three times!
Rarity,"And of course being a castle guard can be thankless work. I'm not saying you did, but if you took a break, you more than deserved it."
Castle Guard 1,"Oh, you're right. We don't get a lot of recognition for what we do."
Spearhead,Except for last night when somepony was nice enough to leave a cake for us. So we did take one little break when we ate that cake.
Rarity,What kind of cake was it?
Spearhead,Cherry with a custard filling.
Rarity,Was the frosting vanilla or chocolate?
Castle Guard 1,Chocolate.
Rarity,Was the base of the cake decorated with buttercream rosettes?
Castle Guard 1,It was.
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, who cares how it was decorated?!"
Rarity,[narrating] Rainbow Dash was questioning my methods. But I knew what I was doing.
Rainbow Dash,Do you?
Rarity,"Oh, oh, oh. Did I say that one out loud?"
Rainbow Dash,"I mean, even I think I'm guilty at this point! I really did want to fly in that show! What if I wrote that note when I was asleep?! Do you know what I do when I sleep?! Because I sure don't!"
Rarity,"Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash. We'll get to the bottom of this. There's only one bakery in Canterlot that makes a chocolate cherry cake with custard filling and buttercream frosting rosettes and that's..."
Rarity,...Cinnamon Chai's Tea and Cake Shop!
Cinnamon Chai,"Hello, how can I help you?"
Rarity,I've heard you have the best chocolate cherry custard cake with buttercream frosting rosettes in town!
Cinnamon Chai,"Ah, you travel in the right circles! We have the only chocolate cherry custard cake with buttercream frosting rosettes in town!"
Rarity,"Oh, no. But somepony's already bought it! Who was the lucky pony?"
Cinnamon Chai,[beat] I can't even say!
Rarity,Why? Because it was somepony famous?
Cinnamon Chai,"No... because it was hard to tell! She was wearing a trench coat, sunglasses, and a scarf around her head that covered most of her face. But I do remember she had a really deep, raspy voice."
Rainbow Dash,"What do you mean, raspy?"
Cinnamon Chai,"Well, kinda like yours."
Rarity,"If there's anything else you can remember, dish."
Cinnamon Chai,"Well, have I got a story for you! The pony who bought the cake threw a big fit when she accidentally got chocolate ganache on her scarf!"
Rarity,That's terrible! What color was the scarf?
Cinnamon Chai,"White! No, maybe more an ivory..."
Rarity,You don't say!
Rainbow Dash,I can't believe you're talking fashion at a time like this!
Rarity,"Rainbow, don't panic. I need you to trust me."
Rainbow Dash,Trust you?! You've spent more time changing clothes than trying to help me! I'm doomed!
Rarity,"No, you're not! Come on!"
Rarity,"[narrating] Rainbow Dash was obviously upset, but I had all my ducks in a row. Except one."
Rarity,"[narrating] She was not going to like it, but there was only one way to find out if my suspicions were correct."
Blaze,"We looked everywhere, but Spitfire wasn't at her mom's house!"
Stormy Flare,Where could she be?
Rarity,I have found the culprit!
Rarity,Somepony sent Spitfire away and framed Rainbow Dash for it. And that pony was none other than... Wind Rider!
Rainbow Dash,"Rarity, I can't believe you would accuse Wind Rider of framing me! He's a living legend, for pony's sake!"
Rarity,All the evidence points to him!
Rainbow Dash,"Peh! What evidence could you possibly have? All you did was ask about cake, admire d<e9>cor, and change outfits a gazillion times!"
Rarity,"Let me explain. I never believed you would send Spitfire away. When we found the rainbow hairs in Spitfire's room, I could tell they didn't fall out. They... were cut! Nopony loses hair in a chunk. And look at the ends. It's a straight line! They were clearly cut with shears, which means somepony planted it! Then when we were examining Spitfire's room, I smelled something on the envelope. Juniper Phoenix, Wind Rider's cologne of choice! Then, in the castle hallway, I noticed some of the damask curtains fell out of their velvet rope-holder, indicating that somepony had been hiding behind them! Perhaps after they dropped off the fake letter?"
Wind Rider,"Juniper Phoenix is a very popular fragrance, and anypony could have moved those curtains."
Rarity,"Precisely why I questioned the castle guards! They were at their post at the entrance to the hallway all night, except for a small window of time when somepony brought them cake. A cake that was ordered by a girl pony with a raspy voice! Whoever ordered the cake got a chocolate stain on her ivory scarf, and I couldn't help but notice that Wind Rider's scarf is tied in a tight Windsor knot instead of its usual loose slipknot! And why is that? Is it to hide the chocolate stain?!"
Wind Rider,"Ah, this is preposterous. Wonderbolts, you don't believe a word of this, right?"
Rarity,Just admit it <U+0096> you're as guilty of framing Rainbow Dash as you are of ruining that ivory scarf!
Wind Rider,"Ah, fine! You caught me! I did it!"
Rainbow Dash,"But why, Wind Rider?! Was it because I took the last broccoli at the dinner and you really, really wanted it?"
Rarity,"No. It was because he was afraid that you would break his long-distance Wonderbolt record! I heard him when Spitfire said you were close to breaking his record. He said, and I quote, 'Heh-heh'. That's the polite but disingenuous laugh you make when you want to seem happy but really you're not."
Wind Rider,"I thought if I could get Rainbow Dash kicked out of the Wonderbolts forever, my record could be preserved."
Rainbow Dash,Really? That is so not cool. And I thought you were the coolest Wonderbolt ever. Until now.
Wind Rider,I did what I had to do to protect my record! Sometimes you gotta play dirty to be the best!
Rainbow Dash,That's not what being a Wonderbolt is all about.
Soarin,"She's right! Wonderbolts look out for each other! Which reminds me, where is Spitfire?"
Wind Rider,"I sent her the letter pretending to be Stormy Flare. I told her I had Pegasitis, and the only cure is the ice iris in the Crystal Mountains."
Rainbow Dash,No wonder she's been gone so long. Ice irises are almost impossible to find in spring!
Soarin,"The Crystal Mountains are too far for anypony to make it there and back before the royal garden opening! Rainbow Dash, we need you to fly in Spitfire's place!"
Rainbow Dash,But Spitfire shouldn't have to miss this! I'm gonna get her!
Soarin,But you'll never make it in time!
Rainbow Dash,Then there's no time to lose!
Blaze,Rainbow Dash is still gone!
Rarity,"Oh, don't panic. If I know Rainbow Dash, she'll come through."
Soarin,"Spitfire, you're back! I can't believe you made it!"
Spitfire,"[out of breath] I wouldn't have, if Rainbow hadn't found me so fast! Gave me enough time to fly back!"
Rainbow Dash,"Rare, I couldn't have done it without you. And I'm sorry I doubted you. But why didn't you tell me what you were doing?"
Rarity,"Well, I didn't want to get your hopes up until I was sure, and I couldn't be sure until I saw that chocolate stain."
Rainbow Dash,"Thank you for believing in me, even when I was doubting you. I'm some friend, huh?"
Rarity,"Actually, you're quite a good friend. You went to get Spitfire, even though it meant you couldn't fly today."
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I'll get my chance one day.
Spitfire,Or today. How'd you like Wind Rider's spot in the show?
Wind Rider,"Uh, w-w-what? Y-You can't do this to me! I'm one of the greatest Wonderbolts there ever was!"
Spitfire,"Not anymore. For attempting to frame Rainbow Dash, I hereby strip you of your Wonderbolts status!"
Soarin,"[to Rainbow Dash] So, would you like to fly with us?"
Rainbow Dash,"Would I?! Woo-hoo! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, aww yeah..."
Soarin,"Uh, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,[embarrassed noise] Coming!
Rarity,"[narrating] So my friend got her moment in the sun. Or the center of an aerial flower, as the case may be. And as for me? I got a chance to show off my Femme Mystique Chic collection!"
Stormy Flare,"That's nice, dear."
Rarity,"Oh, did I say that out loud?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ehh... [blows raspberry] [sighs heavily, groans, sighs again] I'm bored."
Spike,But you're reading.
Twilight Sparkle,I've read all these books already.
Spike,And...?
Twilight Sparkle,And I'm bored! I wanna do something! Things have been so slow around here and I just<U+0097>
Rarity,"Twilight! Twilight! Ooh, Twilight, darling! Oh, thank goodness! It seems that my<U+0097>"
Applejack,[panting] Whew! Got here as fast I<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Yes! Finally! We've been summoned! I wonder where the map wants us to<U+0097>
Spike,"Uh, Twilight?"
Applejack,Where do you think<U+0097>
Rarity,"[excited squeals] Manehattan! We've been called to Manehattan! Oh, I've simply been dying to go back for a visit! And now I return... with a purpose!"
Twilight Sparkle,Hmmm. It looks like you've been summoned to this particular neighborhood here.
Applejack,"Seems a hair odd, though, don't it? Map callin' me to a big city like Manehattan?"
Twilight Sparkle,"You may be more of a country pony at heart, Applejack, but the map picked you two because you're the best ponies to tackle this particular mission."
Applejack,But how will we even know what our mission's supposed to be? That neighborhood probably has twice as many ponies as all of Ponyville.
Rarity,"Pff. Kch. Ts! More like three times! Why, it's not only home to the Haypacking District <U+0096> it's also home to the Fashion District! [to Twilight] Hmm. Shame you weren't called as well, though, darling. You did end up quite a fan of the hustle and bustle of Manehattan on our last visit."
Twilight Sparkle,"It's such an exciting city, and there's still so much I'd like to do there. So many museums and historical landmarks to visit. Not to mention all the libraries! But this is your mission. Heh-heh. Don't worry about me. I've got plenty of... books... to keep me... busy."
Rarity and Applejack,Mm-hmm.
Rarity,[gasps] I just remembered something! The Sisterhooves Social!
Applejack,We'll have to miss it. No tellin' how long we'll be in Manehattan. I sure hope Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle aren't too upset.
Rarity,"Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me!"
Rarity,"Darling, are you all right?"
Applejack,"Ponies move so fast here. Not at all like back home. [to herself] Eyes peeled, ears open. Eyes peeled, ears open."
Rarity,"Remember, Applejack, you're in the big city now. No moseying. You've gotta walk with speed and confidence!"
Rarity,Yoo-hoo!
Diamond Cutter,Move it!
Applejack,Sorry 'bout that.
Strawberry Ice,"Ah, get outta my way!"
Applejack,Sorry.
Others,Pedestrian Ponies 3 & Watch it!
Applejack,"Hey<U+0097> Oh, dear. Butter my biscuits. I can barely cross the street in this town. How am I supposed to help solve a<U+0097>"
Rarity,[gasps] There!
Others,"""Pearmain Worcester"": Yes, I think this is the one."
Rarity,No! No.
Others,"""Pearmain Worcester"": Excuse me?"
Rarity,"That hat clashes with your mane, not to mention it's far too large and will undoubtedly obstruct your vision. Oh, dear, none of these will do. Oh, Applejack! What good timing!"
Rarity,[humming] Here. This will do splendidly.
Others,"""Pearmain Worcester"": Oh, it's lovely! How much would you like for it?"
Rarity,"Oh, no-no, please, please, keep it. I can always make another."
Others,"""Pearmain Worcester"": Thank you!"
Rarity,[to Applejack] And you thought we wouldn't discover our purpose here! Pff. Kch. Ts!
Applejack,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that wasn't it."
Rarity,What? We just saved that poor pony from committing a terrible crime of fashion.
Rarity,"Well, she could've been meeting a friend who would've laughed at her new hat, and then their friendship could've been ruined forever! And... mmm... it's possible."
Applejack,Did your cutie mark glow signifyin' a job well done?
Rarity,"Ye<U+0097> No. I suppose it didn't. Still, a disaster was averted!"
Stinky Bottom,Averted? You just lost me a paying customer!
Rarity,"Oh, my! Oh, I-I-I-I-I'm s-so sorry. I never meant to<U+0097>"
Stinky Bottom,Beat it!
Rarity,"Uh, please accept my sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding, and might I add, what a lovely establishment you have here! [nervous laugh] [clears throat] You're right, Applejack. [sighs] The search continues."
Applejack,"Uh, 'scuse me, I was just wonderin'... Uh, friendship problem, anypony? See, we've been sent here to... A-A map summoned us and, uh... If you could just take a moment to..."
Rarity,Friendship advice! Anypony looking for friendship advice! Good grief. This isn't working.
Applejack,"[sighs] I'm not sure what we're supposed to do. To be honest, I'm still not even sure what the map called me here for."
Rarity,"Oh, try not to worry, Applejack. The map picked us for a reason. Although how we're supposed to uncover that reason, I haven't a clue. We can't possibly approach every single pony in town until we find out what we're meant to d<U+0097>ooh! [reading] ""Please help us restore our long-lost but beloved tradition, the Midsummer Theater Revival. There's a guest performance by a local theater troupe, the Method Mares, as well as games, food, and much, much more. This event promises to bring our Bronclyn neighbors together and restore our sense of community, but there's so much to do and we need your help."" Huh. [gasps] Darling, this is it! The contact on the flyer is Coco Pommel!"
Applejack,"Oh, right! She's the one you got a job makin' costumes for that designer friend o' yours."
Rarity,"Don't you see?! This must be why the map called us here! Oh, and you were so worried!"
Applejack,"Well, I suppose it's at least worth lookin' into... that is, if we can ever get off this street corner."
Coco Pommel,"I can't believe you found my flyer. Quite a coincidence, don't you think?"
Coco Pommel,"An outdoor play held at the community park. Many moons ago, local theater troupes would perform, and ponies in the neighborhood would help make the costumes and design set pieces, prepare food to share during the performance."
Applejack,Y'all do look like you're enjoyin' each others' company. Kinda reminds me of Ponyville.
Rarity,"It sounds lovely, darling."
Coco Pommel,"It was, up until several moons ago."
Applejack,What happened?
Coco Pommel,"That's Charity Kindheart. She was a well-known costume designer on Bridleway. She started the Midsummer Theater Revival as a way to share her passion for theater with the neighborhood. No matter how busy she was, she always made time for the Revival."
Coco Pommel,"But when she moved away to be closer to her grandfillies, the neighborhood lost the special tradition she had started, and worse, the sense of community it fostered."
Street Pony,"Hey, I'm trotting here!"
Applejack,Nopony else stepped up to take over for Charity?
Coco Pommel,"I've been trying to. But I've just gotten a last-minute request to alter costumes for the cast of My Fair Filly, and I'm afraid I haven't made much progress. Oh... There's just so much to do to bring back the Midsummer Revival, and my flyers haven't attracted a single volunteer!"
Rarity,"Say no more! You finish up your work, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend a hoof. Applejack and I will make sure of it!"
Coco Pommel,You will?
Applejack,You bet your boots we will!
Coco Pommel,"Oh, I don't wear boots. I find they chafe my calves when I walk."
Applejack,It's just an expression.
Rarity,"So you see, the Method Mares are only available on this one day, and we need all the help we can get with preparation."
Others,"""Fine Print"": Yeah, not a good time right now. Heh. What am I saying? It's never a good time!"
Rarity,[clearing throat] Well? What do you think?
Others,"""Chock-full Carafe"": I got my own problems. You think I've got hours to dedicate to somepony else's?"
Others,"""Uptown Clover"": Ah, yes, Charity's Midsummer Theater Revival. Such wonderful memories."
Applejack,So you'll help us?
Others,"""Uptown Clover"": Oh, [laughs], don't be ridiculous. I run a very important oat and hay import/export business. Why, I can't spare even a moment for such things!"
Coco Pommel,This is a nightmare.
Rarity,"Oh, not at all, darling. It's quite lovely."
Applejack,I think she was talkin' about the Midsummer Theater Revival.
Coco Pommel,"I finished the alterations for My Fair Filly, but I've barely started the costumes for the Revival, and the Method Mares are coming to the park tomorrow for a costume fitting and rehearsal!"
Rarity,"Well, I could help you with the costumes."
Coco Pommel,"But what are we going to do about the rest? The park is in desperate need of repairs, and the sets still need to be built!"
Applejack,"Well I know a thing or two about buildin' and fixin' things. It's kinda, well, my thing. Could be the reason the map called me here!"
Rarity,"You see, dear? We went out looking for volunteers when all the help you need is right here."
Applejack,Uh-huh.
Rarity,The map wouldn't have chosen just Applejack and me if it was more than we could handle. Everything is going to be just fine!
Rarity,Perhaps I spoke too soon...
Coco Pommel,"Oh, dear, you're right. Are you sure you can manage this by yourself?"
Applejack,"I know it looks bad, but I'm movin' as fast as I can."
Rarity,"Don't worry, we've still got plenty of time. Everything's going to be<U+0097>"
On Stage,"Um, excuse me? Is this where the Midsummer Theater Revival is supposed to be, perchance?"
Raspberry Beret,We're here for the dress rehearsal?
Coco Pommel,"Oh, yes! We've just put the finishing touches on the costumes."
Others,"""Late Show"": [to Stardom] At least those look professional."
Raspberry Beret,"We'll do a dry run of the play first, and then the fitting."
Applejack,"No, wait! I haven't gotten a chance to<U+0097>"
Applejack,...reinforce the stage yet.
Coco Pommel,"[sighs] I just wanted to live up to Charity's example, to bring my neighborhood together again. But the park is still a mess, we haven't even thought about what refreshments to serve during the performance, and even if we had, we don't have a stage for the Method Mares to perform on! It's hopeless... Just hopeless!"
Rarity,"[hushed] I don't understand. The map summoned us here to solve a friendship problem. We've clearly found it, but why did it send the two of us? Why not Twilight? I'm sure she could have used her magic to transform this park in an instant!"
Applejack,"I've been thinkin' the same thing. I mean, I can at least see why you're here <U+0096> Coco's your friend, and you have an eye for costumes and all <U+0096> but me? I was never gonna be able to finish a project this big."
Rarity,"[dramatically] We'll return to Ponyville as failures! Why must this be, Applejack? Why? Why?! Wh<U+0097>"
Applejack,Now hold on there. I'm not suggestin' we pack up and go home.
Rarity,[muffled] Then what are you suggesting<U+0097> [ptoo] Then what are you suggesting?
Applejack,"I'm suggestin' we stop worryin' about what we can't do and start doing what we can. I think I've got a plan. It won't be anythin' big or fancy, but it'll be somethin'. And somethin's gotta be better than nothin', right?"
Coco Pommel,I suppose so...
Applejack,That's the spirit! Sorta...
Applejack,"Alright, y'all, it's ready!"
On Stage,Should we go ahead and start?
Raspberry Beret,"[as Charity Kindheart] Excuse me. I'm Charity Kindheart. I'm here about the open design position. I brought some samples of my work. I'm sorry I'm late. I had the hardest time finding my way here. [tearing up] I just moved here, and I keep getting mixed up by the street names! I had a map, but I dropped it in a puddle, which only made the street names harder to read!"
On Stage,I see.
Others,"""Cloudy Daze"": What is that?"
Blueberry Curls,"I dunno, sugar, looks like some kinda play."
Others,"""Cloudy Daze"": Well, can we stay and watch it please? Please, can we, can we?"
Blueberry Curls,"Oh, alright, I suppose we could stay for a minute."
Others,"""Late Show"": Excuse me, but your next appointment is here."
On Stage,"Alright. Send him in. [to Raspberry Beret] I'm sorry, but based on these samples, I just don't think this is the place for you."
On Stage,"Don't get me wrong. These clothes are all exquisite and well-made, but more theatrical than avant-garde. Have you considered costume design? I have a contact on Bridleway! If you're interested, I can put you in touch with him. ...And scene."
Others,"""Stardom"": Charity, dear, is that you?"
Raspberry Beret,"Hello, Mrs. Pearblossom! I didn't see<U+0097>oops!"
Others,"""Stardom"": Oh, let me help you, dear. Are these the costumes you've been working on?"
Raspberry Beret,"Yes, I was supposed to be finished by now, but there's just so much to do, and I still have a few last-minute alterations to make before opening night! I'm sorry I couldn't get enough tickets for everypony in the neighborhood. I hope Mr. Pearblossom wasn't too disappointed. I know Trotter on the Roof is one of his favorites."
Others,"""Stardom"": Oh, my dear filly, don't worry about that. We're so proud of you. We shall be with you in spirit!"
Raspberry Beret,Thank you! You've all made me feel so welcome here and have become like family to me! I just wish I could share this experience with you and the others!
Others,"""Rivet"": Eh, what's goin' on?"
Luckette,It's the Midsummer Theater Revival. The Method Mares are performing!
Others,"""Rivet"": [sighs] The Revival. Mhm, yeah. My pop used to bring me."
Others,"""Stardom"": So nice of you to put on this play for the neighborhood."
Raspberry Beret,"I couldn't have done it without everypony's help! I know it's not Bridleway, but<U+0097>"
Others,"""Stardom"": Oh, pish-tosh! It's perfect, dear!"
Pearly Stitch,"Oh, you're such a dear, thank you! This is so nice. Haven't seen the neighborhood this friendly since Charity moved away!"
On Stage,"Thank you, fillies and gentlecolts. Please give a warm welcome to the one who made this entire event possible <U+0096> our neighbor Coco Pommel!"
Coco Pommel,"[clears throat] Thank you all so much for coming. The Midsummer Theater Revival was always something that meant so much to me, and it seems it means quite a lot to all of you as well. I really can't take all the credit, though. My dear friends Rarity and Applejack helped me ever so much."
Rarity,"Oh, darling, please, it was just a few costumes."
Applejack,"Aw, shucks, I just happen to be good with a hammer is all. To be honest, we had much bigger plans to start. When those fell through, we decided to simplify. This here was the result."
Rarity,"Oh, don't be so modest. Coco and I were lost."
Coco Pommel,You bet your boots we were!
Others,"""Viola"": We just wanted to say how much we enjoyed the Midsummer Theater Revival and how much it inspired us!"
Applejack,"Oh, yeah?"
Others,"""Uptown Clover"": I used to think that to help my community I had to do something big. Heh-heh. And let's face it <U+0096> in this day and age, who has the time for such a commitment? But here, you did something as simple as building a stage and putting on a play and, heh, look at how it's brought everypony together."
Others,"""Viola"": I saw Coco's flyers for volunteers but didn't think anything I'd have time to do would be that useful. Now I wish I'd offered to help, even if it was just pulling a few weeds or planting a few flowers."
Applejack,"Not sure if you noticed, but the park is far from bein' fixed up. I imagine if you look around, you'll find there's lots of little ways for you to get involved in changin' this place for the better."
Others,"""Viola"": And I will!"
Others,"""Uptown Clover"": And I don't think we'll be alone!"
Applejack,Yee-hoo!
Applejack,We did it!
Rarity,[gasps] I understand now! It all makes perfect sense!
Applejack,Huh?
Rarity,I know why the map called you here.
Applejack,You do?
Rarity,"If Twilight had used her magic to fix the park, it wouldn't have fixed the real problem, which is that these Manehattan ponies didn't think they had time to do something for their community! But by building that stage and making sure the play went on, you showed them that just by doing something small, you can make a big difference!"
Applejack,"Well, I'll be!"
Rarity,Seems you have more in common with the Manehattan ponies than you thought!
Applejack,"Heh-heh. But all the same, I'd sure like to head back to Ponyville on the next train. I want to check in with Apple Bloom and find out how the Sisterhooves Social turned out."
Rarity,"Oh, absolutely, my dear. Just as soon as I stop that pony in the shop over there from purchasing that dreadfully hideous scarf! Stop! You're making a terrible mistake!"
Granny Smith,"Oh, snickerdoodle! Where is the darned thing? [groans] I wish for once I'd remembered to label these boxes! Uh, Big Mac, be a dear and help me move those... Uh, maybe it's in that one on the bottom."
Granny Smith,"Oh, dagnabbit, it's not in there either!"
Apple Bloom,[muffled laughing] [normal] You can't catch me!
Applejack,[laughing] Woo-hoo!
Apple Bloom,Hey!
Applejack,[more laughing] You trickster!
Granny Smith,"Sisterhooves Social is right around the corner. Thought it'd be nice to award the winner of the big race the ribbon from when we hosted the very first Social! If'n of course I could find the darn thing. Oh, would you looky here! My, how Apple Bloom used to love watching you make that thing fly. It's like she thought you was magic. Ah, right, enough reminiscin'. Gotta find that ribbon! If you would just help me<U+0097> [straining] pull... this... box, then maybe I can... Uh, Big Mac?"
Granny Smith,[straining] Found her!
Apple Bloom and Applejack,S-I-S-T-E-R-S! Which two sisters are the best? We are! Apple Bloom and Applejack forever! Yee-hoo!
Apple Bloom,We're gonna win every competition at the Sisterhooves Social! Those other fillies aren't gonna know what hit 'em!
Applejack,"Oh. Hey there, Big Mac! Did you want somethin'?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"Hold that thought. Applejack, you are the most awesome sister ever!"
Applejack,"Aw, gee-whiz. [laughs]. Well I think it's sweet that you hold that opinion, but<U+0097>"
Apple Bloom,"It's not opinion! It's objective fact! You saved Equestria like a gazillion times, you're smart, funny, strong... Why you're the best sister of all time! Probably the best Apple of all time! Right, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"And with you by my side, I am guaranteed to taste sweet, sweet Sisterhooves Social victory! Go, Apples, go, go, go, Apples go!"
Applejack,"Uh, Apple Bloom? I think Big Mac's got somethin' he wants to show you."
Apple Bloom,"Oh, hey. Is that the toy we used to play with when I was little?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Apple Bloom,"Neat. [to Applejack] Alright then! Let's get back to practicin'! One more run-through of our jugglin' routine, make sure our harmonies are tight in our song, and see if we can't beat our best pie-eatin' time!"
Applejack,"Hold on, sugarcube. I need a minute to talk with Big Mac."
Apple Bloom,Mind if I go ahead and start eatin' this pie?!
Applejack,"Hey, Big Mac, you all right?"
Big McIntosh,[sighs] Yup.
Applejack,You sure? You seemed a little down back there.
Big McIntosh,[scoffs] Nope.
Applejack,"Come on, you can tell me. You feelin' a little left out? Apple Bloom and I have been spendin' a lot of time together gettin' ready for the Social."
Applejack,[gasps] What in the...?
Apple Bloom,"Your cutie mark! You're being summoned, Applejack! This is so cool!"
Big McIntosh,[sighs] Eeyup.
Applejack,Now calm down. Let me just go over to Twilight's castle and see what's what! Maybe it's just a false alarm.
Apple Bloom,But you said it was a false alarm!
Applejack,"I said maybe it's a false alarm. Well, it's not. Rarity and I have to go to Manehattan."
Apple Bloom,Can't you just tell that map it'll have to wait a couple days?
Applejack,"No can do, sugarcube. When duty calls, I gotta answer right away. What kind of an example would I be settin' for my little sister if I didn't?"
Apple Bloom,This can't be happening! Your extreme awesomeness is backfiring on me!
Applejack,"[sighs] I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. [to Big Mac] Try and cheer her up, won't you?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Granny Smith,"Breakfast, come and get it!"
Granny Smith,"Oh, it's no use, Big Mac. If I know my Apple Bloom, she won't come out of a funk this funky 'til her big sister gets back."
Sweetie Belle,"Hey, Apple Bloom, the Social's gonna start in a few hours. Thought you might want to go with us."
Scootaloo,"Since Rarity and Applejack are out of town, you and Sweetie Belle can cheer on me and Rainbow Dash instead!"
Sweetie Belle,Pretty great they're letting you participate even though you're not technically sisters.
Granny Smith,"Well, the Social's always had a pretty loose definition of what consti-ma-tutes a sister. As long as you share a bond that represents the spirit of the Social, you're in!"
Sweetie Belle,So what do you say?
Scootaloo,You coming?
Apple Bloom,Why not...? Got nothin' better to do... Lemme wash up and I'll meet you in a little bit.
Granny Smith,"[sighs] Such a shame we don't live closer to all your second cousins. You could maybe do the Social with one of them instead. What is it, Big Mac? Y'all got an idea?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Apple Bloom,What? What is it?!
Scootaloo,Today is our big day!
Rainbow Dash,We have so got this. I'm gonna go sign us in.
Sweetie Belle,I guess I'm just a little jealous you two get to compete and I don't. But at least I get to be here and cheer you on! I thought Apple Bloom was gonna be here too.
Scootaloo,"Guess she changed her mind. Hey, there you are! You ready to cheer on me and Rainbow Dash to victory?"
Apple Bloom,"Uh, not exactly. Seems I'm gonna get to participate after all."
Sweetie Belle,[gasps] Applejack is back from Manehattan already? That must mean Rarity is back too!
Sweetie Belle,Your cousin who what now?
Big McIntosh,"Oh, my! I'm so delighted to meet your little friends, Apple Bloom. Would these be your dear and beloved Cutie Mark Crusaders?"
Apple Bloom,"[sighs] Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, cousin Orchard Blossom."
Big McIntosh,It is my extra-ordinary pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Sweetie Belle,[deadpan] That's Big Mac in a dress.
Big McIntosh,"Big Mac? Why, as charmed as I am that you find me in the slightest resemblance to such a-a-a fine and noble product of the Apple clan. I am astonished in equal measure. However, I shall take this startling observation under advisement given that it's from such an astute and perceptive filly as yourself, Sweetie Belle."
Sweetie Belle,"That's awful nice of you to say, cousin Orchard Blossom! I've been told before I'm pretty observant."
Big McIntosh,I haven't the slightest doubt.
Big McIntosh,"Pardon me. My dearest cousin Applejack is regrettably unable to be here as planned, so I, her cousin Orchard Blossom, will accompany Apple Bloom in her stead. I trust that's acceptable to all concerned?"
Rainbow Dash,"Cousin Orchard Blossom, huh? I know Applejack has a lot of relatives, but I feel like she would've mentioned you."
Big McIntosh,"Why, you must be Rainbow Dash. You're Scootaloo's... say... how are y'all related again?"
Rainbow Dash,Hm. Why don't I just let you finish signing in? [hushed] But don't think me and Scootaloo are gonna take it easy on you just 'cause you're a stallion!
Big McIntosh,"[laughs] Now, where were we?"
Big McIntosh,"[tuts] You mean 'powder your muzzle', don't you, dear? Such a more, uh, feminine-like reference to nature's call, don't you agree?"
Sweetie Belle,Have they called your brother's bluff yet?
Apple Bloom,"No, but they're about to! I can't bear to watch!"
Big McIntosh,"Yoo-hoo! Apple Bloom! They've approved us as a pair! [giggles] Hurry along now, precious!"
Apple Bloom,I can't believe they bought it!
Sweetie Belle,"It's sweet he wants to help you out like this. Weird, but sweet."
Booth Barker,"Bravo, bravo! Weren't those two sisters great? Now, where are our next competitors?"
Big McIntosh,"Here we are! This one, please."
Booth Barker,Excellent choice... ma'am.
Apple Bloom,[hushed] You sure you know all the words? 'Cause it took Applejack a pretty long time to get it down.
Big McIntosh,[hushed] Did it now?
Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh,We all love our brothers And our fathers and mothers We honor them like every family should
Others,But there's somethin' that's quite unique When my sister's there with me And we share that special bond of sisterhood
Apple Bloom,Sisterhood
Big McIntosh,Sisterhood
Apple Bloom,Is a special kind of friend Sisterhood
Big McIntosh,Sisterhood
Apple Bloom,Is a bond that never ends
Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh,It's not always perfect You might fight or be misunderstood But together you'll always have sisterhood
Big McIntosh,Sisterhood
Apple Bloom,Sisterhood
Big McIntosh,Sisterhood
Apple Bloom,Sisterhood
Big McIntosh,Sisterhood
Apple Bloom,Sisterhood
Big McIntosh,[deep bass] Sisterhood!
Apple Bloom,[joining in] ...ood
Big McIntosh,"Just a frog in my throat, dear. Probably just need to get a sip of water. If you'll excuse us, we've another event in which to participate. Oh, my, that certainly didn't go as I had planned. But don't you worry. We'll get you a blue ribbon yet, Apple Bloom."
Apple Bloom,You sure about that?
Big McIntosh,As sure as my name is cousin Orchard Blossom.
Apple Bloom,[to herself] But that isn't your name!
Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh as Orchard Blossom,"C-O-U-S-I-N-S! Which two sis<U+0097> uh, cousins are the best? We are! Apple Bloom and Appleja<U+0097> I mean, Orchardjack<U+0097> Blossom forever!"
Big McIntosh,Whee!
Apple Bloom,Whoaaa!
Apple Bloom,[spits] Yay.
Big McIntosh,"Oh, I don't know why I didn't choose to wear something more casual. Why, I knew that juggling routine like the back of my hoof! But never you mind. There is still the race to be run!"
Apple Bloom,"I really appreciate all the effort, Big Ma<U+0097> cousin Orchard Blossom, but maybe we just skip the whole obstacle course thing and call it a day."
Big McIntosh,"Why, Apple Bloom! I wouldn't hear of it! Your cousin Orchard Blossom may be many things, but she is not a quitter."
Apple Bloom,"I'm sure she's not, but it's like Applejack said! There'll be more Sisterhooves Socials down the line, and I'm sure she'll help me get a blue ribbon next time around."
Big McIntosh,"B-But you wanted to win it this Sisterhooves Social! And no matter what, I am gonna get you that win! Why, I simply have to."
Rainbow Dash,"Alright, Scootaloo, remember the parts where teamwork really comes into play!"
Scootaloo,How could I forget? We've been training all week!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, hot stuff! What's our move on the grape squish?"
Scootaloo,The alley-oop.
Rainbow Dash,Apple toss?
Scootaloo,Flip-flop.
Rainbow Dash,Egg carrying?
Scootaloo,Flutter-bomb.
Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo,Yeah!
Big McIntosh,"Oh, dear."
Granny Smith,[through megaphone] Competi-sis-tors! Take your positions!
Granny Smith,"[through megaphone] And a-ready, and a-set, go!"
Rainbow Dash,"Nice jump, Scoot!"
Apple Bloom,Woo-hoo!
Apple Bloom,Yikes! You almost squished me!
Big McIntosh,"Pick up those hooves, Apple Bloom! Why, you're barely movin' at a mosey!"
Big McIntosh,"Come on, junebug, it's... like you've never carried an egg before!"
Apple Bloom,Argh! I'm goin' as fast as I can!
Big McIntosh,Woo-hoo!
Big McIntosh,"[coughs] I mean, [clears throat] victory is ours, sweet Apple Bloom!"
Big McIntosh,Uh-oh.
Registration Pony,"""Uh-oh"" indeed!"
Apple Bloom,I should've known you'd eventually get busted for bein' a stallion!
Registration Pony,"Oh, no, we've known all along. The Sisterhooves Social has always had a loose policy when it comes to what counts as a ""sister"". But we do have a strict policy when it comes to sportsponyship! In your ""sister's"" desperation to win, he used brute strength to physically take out the competitors. Uh, that kind of behavior is not just unbecoming of a lady, but quite frankly, of anypony! And for that, you two are hereby disqualified!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hah! Looks like we win, squirt!"
Scootaloo,Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Apple Bloom,I told you I should've just waited until the next Social to win with Applejack.
Apple Bloom,"You know I'm... not mad, right?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,I mean... let's face it <U+0096> you dressin' up as my cousin Orchard Blossom was a pretty crazy idea in the first place.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,And it's not like you got me disqualified from the Social forever or anythin'. I can participate next time with Applejack. Everything's fine.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"I just don't understand why you went so crazy there at the end of the race. I mean, I know you like to win an' all, but... you wanna tell me what's goin' on?"
Big McIntosh,Nope.
Apple Bloom,"Alright. Well, it's getting late. You comin'?"
Big McIntosh,Nope.
Apple Bloom,"Okay. See you later, I guess..."
Big McIntosh,Apple Bloom?
Apple Bloom,Yeah?
Big McIntosh,"When you were little, you used to look up to me, thought I was the best thing since zap apple jam. Things are different now. Applejack's the hero of the Apple family, always rushin' off to save Equestria. And I'm just here on the farm, doin' chores, helpin' out the way I can, nothin' special, nobody's hero. I guess I just thought... oh, never mind. Here I am about to start blabberin' on about my feelin's. You don't wanna hear all this."
Apple Bloom,"Yes, I do!"
Big McIntosh,"I guess I just thought if I could... fill in for Applejack at the Social and get you a blue ribbon, well, I could be somepony you looked up to again. Be your hero again. Even if it was for just a day. It was foolish and I'm ashamed. Please, I just wanna be alone right now."
Apple Bloom,"Yeah, well, too bad, you big goof! 'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere. And I know that you're always gonna be here when I need you. Heck, you'll do a whole obstacle course in high heels if you think it'll help me get somethin' I want. You're my big brother. You've always been a hero to me, Big Mac, and you always will be. I'm real sorry I haven't been lettin' you know that's how I feel. Guess both of us have been holdin' back when it comes to expressin' ourselves, huh?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Granny Smith,Big Mac! Apple Bloom! Your sister's home! She says she's got quite a story to tell about her trip to Manehattan!
Apple Bloom,"Be there in a bit! I'm spending some quality time with my big brother! [to Big Mac] Hey, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup?
Apple Bloom,How do you think cousin Orchard Blossom would describe this sunset?
Big McIntosh,"[chuckles] Why, dear, I do declare this is the most beautiful sunset my eyes have ever looked upon. Though sitting here on these tree roots is a trifle uncomfortable for my hindquarters."
Apple Bloom,"Okay, Crusaders! Back to the business of earnin' our cutie marks! Any suggestions?"
Scootaloo,"No, we've tried everything!"
Sweetie Belle,We've run out of ideas.
Apple Bloom,"Are you kiddin' me, Crusaders? We can do better than that!"
Apple Bloom,We've been searchin' for our cutie marks For a while now Tryin' to find out how we fit in
Others,So many ways we've tried before But we keep on tryin' more
Cutie Mark Crusaders,'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in
Others,We'll make our mark One way or another We'll make our mark On the day that we discover The ultimate reward of our cutie marks!
Apple Bloom,"Now, that's more like it!"
Pipsqueak,Cutie Mark Crusaders! Help!
Apple Bloom,"What's wrong, Pipsqueak?"
Pipsqueak,"I'm running for student pony president, I was hoping you three would be my campaign managers!"
Apple Bloom,"We've never tried gettin' our cutie marks in campaign managin'! What do ya say, Crusaders?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Yeah! Hoof!
Apple Bloom,"[loudly] So, Pip, how would you help the school if you were elected student pony president?"
Pipsqueak,Our playground equipment took quite a beating during Twilight's battle with Tirek!
Pipsqueak,"If I'm voted in as student pony president, I'll go to the school board and right this wrong!"
Diamond Tiara,"Well, I think that's a ridiculous waste of money! It's just like when Twist proposed to repair the window that Discord destroyed! She just wanted to repair it like a plain old schoolhouse window. But you all know voting for me was the best choice because I convinced the school board to give that window visual appeal!"
Apple Bloom,"'Course, it doesn't hurt that her mother Spoiled Rich is president of the school board."
Silver Spoon,"Exactly! Which is why when Diamond Tiara is voted student pony president, the school will be putting a statue of her in the center of our schoolyard!"
Diamond Tiara,[through gritted teeth] Silver Spoon! That was my big announcement for when I won!
Silver Spoon,I was only trying to help.
Diamond Tiara,[through gritted teeth] I don't need that kind of help!
Apple Bloom,Haven't we all had enough of Diamond Tiara?
Scootaloo,Do we really need a big statue of her?
Sweetie Belle,Especially where our playground equipment should be?
Pipsqueak,A vote for Pip is a vote for the playground!
Diamond Tiara,A vote for Diamond Tiara is a vote for more Diamond Tiara!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,It's time to make a change This is our chance Don't be afraid to do what's right He's it! Vote for Pip!
Others,"We got an opportunity To have fun again A vote for Pip, and you can join the fight"
Others,It's time for a new leader It's time to make a change We're here to fight for what we believe (Vote for Pip!) It's finally time we beat her And play a better game 'Cause when we vote together There's nothing that we can't achieve
Diamond Tiara,"I don't believe what I am hearing I'm the only one you should be cheering Pipsqueak? Try ""Pip's weak!"" Don't you think?"
Others,"But a diamond is perfection It's natural selection So your vote better be for me, not the weakest link"
Apple Bloom,We'll let the votin' decide!
Diamond Tiara,Everypony has their little secrets
Others,I know you do A vote for me will help you keep them safe
Others,Like your creepy super strength!
Others,Or your mane extension A little thing I won't mention Or those freakish large teeth in your face!
Apple Bloom,"Come on now, ponies! Don't listen to her!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,You've gotta vote for change It's time for a new leader End all the tyranny Vote now and we can beat her
Others,It's now another day And we believe in what's right
Foals,Vote for Pip! Vote for Pip!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Our victory is in sight
Diamond Tiara,"Stop! Everypony who hasn't voted, listen up!"
Others,Pip makes promises he can't keep But I can do more
Others,You could really use a new bookbag
Others,'Cause I'll make things happen That none of you here can afford
Others,"To do, like, ever!"
Others,Wouldn't you like a little something sweet? Here's a parasol to hide you from the heat Who says that I can't be nice?
Others,But first there's one thing An itsy-bitsy little string And voting for me is the price!
Silver Spoon,I've a tiny suggestion That you should be aware You could probably win this election If you show them all you real<U+0097>
Diamond Tiara,I don't recall asking you to speak!
Sweetie Belle,"Well, if that's how you treat your best friend, then I choose Pipsqueak!"
Foals,Vote!
Foals,He's it! Vote for Pip! Vote!
Foals,Vote for Pip!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,It's time for a new leader It's time to make a change We're here to fight for what we believe
Foals,Vote for Pip!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,It's finally time we beat her And play a better game 'Cause when we vote together There's nothing that we can't achieve
Foals,Vote for Pip!
Cheerilee,The votes have been counted! The student pony president is... Pipsqueak!
Diamond Tiara,Huh?!
Apple Bloom,"Oh, my gosh, Crusaders! Pip won!"
Pipsqueak,"I couldn't have won without the hard work of my campaign managers, the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Sweetie Belle,Campaign manager cutie marks!
Diamond Tiara,"Guess you're not as good as you thought, blank flanks! In fact, I demand a recount!"
Cheerilee,"Trust me, Diamond Tiara. Pip won."
Diamond Tiara,"I'll be the judge of that, Miss Cheerilee!"
Diamond Tiara,What?! One vote! Silver Spoon! You didn't vote for me?!
Silver Spoon,"No, I didn't."
Diamond Tiara,But you're my best friend!
Silver Spoon,"Am I? 'Cause I tried to help by mentioning your 'surprise' statue, and suddenly I wasn't even allowed to speak! You could have actually won this election if you just listened to me. You wanna know how? [whispering] Sorry. I'm not allowed to speak."
Silver Spoon,[to Cutie Mark Crusaders and Pipsqueak] What? I don't have to follow her drum any more.
Apple Bloom,"I know Diamond Tiara's been pretty awful, but... we should probably make sure she's okay. Just 'cause she's never cared about anypony else's feelings doesn't mean we shouldn't care about hers."
Spoiled Rich,Diamond Tiara! Why are you making that face? That is not the face of a winner.
Diamond Tiara,Because... I didn't win.
Spoiled Rich,What?! You mean I hefted all these party supplies to celebrate nothing?!
Diamond Tiara,Sorry mother.
Spoiled Rich,"It's bad enough you lost to that transplant from Trottingham, but imagine if you'd lost to one of those blank flanks. As a Rich pony, you must always think of your social standing."
Fancy Pants,Hm.
Spoiled Rich,"That starts here in Ponyville and reaches all over Equestria. Don't ever forget that, Diamond Tiara. Ever!"
Diamond Tiara,If I'm a diamond Then why do I feel so rough? I'm as strong as a stone Even that's not enough
Others,There's something jagged in me And I've made such mistakes I thought that diamonds were hard Though I feel I could break
Others,Would you believe That I've always wished I could be somepony else? Yet I can't see What I need to do to be the pony I want to be
Others,"I've been told my whole life What to do, what to say Nopony showed me that There might be some better way"
Others,And now I feel like I'm lost I don't know what to do The ground is sinking away I'm about to fall through
Others,Would you believe That I've always wished I could be somepony else? Yet I can't see What I need to do to be the pony I want to be
Others,To be the pony I want to be
Sweetie Belle,Is it weird that I feel bad for her?
Scootaloo,"If it is, then... I'm weird, too."
Apple Bloom,"She wants to change, but she doesn't know how."
Sweetie Belle,Seems like she could use a friend or two to help her figure it out.
Apple Bloom,"Hey, Diamond Tiara! Wait up!"
Diamond Tiara,What do you three want? To gloat? Rub in my defeat?
Apple Bloom,"Actually, we wanted to invite you to our clubhouse to hang out."
Diamond Tiara,Really?
Scootaloo,"Yeah, for real!"
Diamond Tiara,"Well, thanks to you all, I don't have any important class president business to attend to or anything. So I might as well."
Sweetie Belle,That sounds like a yes...
Diamond Tiara,"So, do you three just sit around here plotting out different ways to try and get your cutie marks?"
Apple Bloom,"Actually, yeah."
Diamond Tiara,You three are... really lucky.
Cutie Mark Crusaders,We are?!
Diamond Tiara,"Yeah! You get to explore all these options, learning who you really are before you're stuck with something you don't understand."
Apple Bloom,"But... you've done that, right?"
Diamond Tiara,"Yeah, 'cause I have my cutie mark! And I'm not struggling at all to figure out who I'm supposed to be and what I'm supposed to be doing with this mark that's already on my flank!"
Apple Bloom,Uh... are you sure about that?
Diamond Tiara,[scoffs] That's a weird question.
Sweetie Belle,"Not really, since we kind of overheard you yesterday."
Diamond Tiara,Were you trying to get your cutie mark in spying? Is that on your little chart?
Sweetie Belle,"No! We were just worried about you when you lost the election, and then you lost your friend, and then your mom yelled at you..."
Apple Bloom,"We know you wanna change, and we think we can<U+0097>"
Pipsqueak,[muffled] Help!
Pipsqueak,Cutie Mark Crusaders! I was at the school board meeting and they didn't approve my request for the new playground equipment!
Sweetie Belle,Why not?
Pipsqueak,"There's no money in the budget! So I checked my Peggy bank to see if I had enough bits, but my little Peggy wasn't nearly full enough!"
Sweetie Belle,"Don't worry, Pip!"
Scootaloo,We'll meet you back at school.
Apple Bloom,And help you find a solution!
Pipsqueak,"Thanks, Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Diamond Tiara,"Oh, I already have a solution! Our new student pony president is gonna be kicked out of office, and I'll be reinstated!"
Scootaloo,Where's she going?
Apple Bloom,Where do you think?! C'mon! After her!
Sweetie Belle,Wait! I'm coming too!
Diamond Tiara,"Cutie Mark Crusaders, get out of my way Those ponies need to know the truth And they'll hear it from me"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Stop! Diamond Tiara, this is not the way You know you're better than this hostility"
Diamond Tiara,You don't even know me at all Don't understand the meaning of my fall What my family would think if I ever Fail at anything
Others,I'm a diamond <U+0096> that means you'll never break No matter what be the cost of the path I take Whatever I have to do to win in the end
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Stop! This is not the answer Wait! And it's plainly seen Listen! You can redeem yourself But by helping others, not by being mean"
Others,"We know you want friends who admire you You want to be the star with all the power too But there's a better way, there's a better wa-a-ay"
Others,There's so much more still left to Learn about yourself See the light that shines in you We know you can be somepony else
Others,You can stop right now And try another start You'll finally free yourself from the dark And see the light And see the light of your cutie mark
Diamond Tiara,"Everypony, I have an announcement!"
Apple Bloom,Diamond Tiara! Think hard about the choice you're makin' right now!
Scootaloo,You can be a better pony!
Spoiled Rich,"Diamond Tiara! I just happened to be here for the school board meeting, and this is what I see when we adjourn? My daughter associating with confused, insignificant lowlifes? Socializing with their kind is not how you move up in Equestria! Come, Diamond Tiara!"
Diamond Tiara,"No, mother!"
Spoiled Rich,Excuse me?!
Diamond Tiara,"You've spent your life acting like a high horse and raised me to follow in your hoofprints! At first I thought this was fine, but then I finally realized I wanted something you don't have <U+0096> friends!"
Spoiled Rich,"That's enough, Diamond Tiara! Step away from those blank flanks!"
Diamond Tiara,"These are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and they are my friends! You need to stop calling them such mean and hurtful names! They are working harder to get their cutie marks than anypony I've ever seen! And they will get them exactly when they discover their true talent, which I guarantee will be amazing! Now, will you please deliver this to father?"
Spoiled Rich,"Yes, of course, dear..."
Diamond Tiara,"I have to thank you, Crusaders. Obviously I've known since I got my cutie mark that my talent is getting other ponies to do what I want. I just asked my father if he could donate the money for the new playground equipment!"
Diamond Tiara,"[to Pipsqueak] I knew you were worried for a second there, weren't you? Ha! Well, I think it's all gonna work out just fine, Mister President!"
Diamond Tiara,We'll build a playground For all of us to enjoy So full of games There's enough for each girl and boy
Others,"I want to help and do Everything that I can I'm here to show you I changed Listen up, here's the plan"
Others,"Bring it in! That's right, keep it coming! Hey there, you with the amazing strength. Can you help them move that merry-go-round across the lawn? Thank you so much! And you with the super teeth, we need you to help with that teeter-totter. You got it! That's the spirit!"
Others,There's so much I can do To help everypony else I see the light that shines in me I know I can be my better self
Others,I can free the past 'Cause now the future's bright for me My cutie mark has set me free To do what's right and be the pony I want to be
Others,And be the pony I want to be!
Apple Bloom,"I've been thinkin', Crusaders. We spend an awful lot of time fussin' and frettin' tryin' to discover our true talent. But when we take a little time off, we end up helpin' other ponies figure out their true talent!"
Sweetie Belle,"Yeah, and I think that's way more important than worrying about our cutie marks, don't you?"
Scootaloo,Absolutely! I don't care if I ever get my cutie mark as long as I get to hang out with my best friends.
Apple Bloom,"So what do you say, Crusaders? Want to just focus on helpin' others find their cutie marks?"
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,Yeah!
Sweetie Belle,What happened?
Apple Bloom,What's goin' on?
Diamond Tiara,It's your cutie marks! They're amazing!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,We all got the same cutie mark! Cutie Mark Crusaders forever!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,We were searching for our cutie marks For a while there Trying to find out how we fit in
Others,So many ways we've tried before But we kept on trying more 'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in
Scootaloo,Now we know what it took all along
Sweetie Belle,And our journey here is never really done
Apple Bloom,For it is more than just a mark It's a place for us to start
Cutie Mark Crusaders,An adventure that has only just begun
Others,We'll make our mark Show the world what we can do We'll make our mark Helping fillies to break through To the ultimate reward of a cutie mark
Pinkie Pie,"All right, everypony! Get ready for the biggest cute-cea<f1>era celebration ever!"
Applejack,"Oh, sugarcube, if Mom and Dad were here, they'd be so proud of ya."
Apple Bloom,"Oh... Thanks, Applejack."
Applejack,Now go on and party with your pals.
Rainbow Dash,"I'm so proud of you, little buddy You've taught me a thing or two"
Rarity,You've inspired everypony around you And you've inspired me too
Others,"[Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack] You've made your mark Done Equestria so proud You've made your mark And we're here to sing it loud For the ultimate reward of your cutie mark"
Apple Bloom,"Well, what do you think, Crusaders? Were these cutie marks totally worth waiting for or what?"
Sweetie Belle,Yeah! I can't wait to see who we're gonna help next!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,We started out just three Crusaders driven to see What we find in our hearts Discover our destiny
Others,"And here we are, best friends About to start it again An adventure that never will end"
Others,We'll make our mark Helping fillies most in need We'll make our mark So each one of them succeeds 'Cause the ultimate reward is a cutie mark!
Pinkie Pie,"Five hundred and sixty-six, five hundred and sixty-seven, five hundred and sixty-eight... Phew! Look at that, Pound Cake! I am so close to breaking my personal cupcake-icing record!"
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. My goodness! I can't believe what I'm seeing here!
Pinkie Pie,Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Pinkie, would you mind watching the counter while I pop to the supply room? We've just received a very special order, and the ingredients need to be perfect."
Pinkie Pie,Okie-dokie-lokie.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Thanks, dear!"
Pinkie Pie,A baby?! Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are having a baby?! [squeals] This is the best news ever! I can't wait to tell Twilight!
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, em, Pinkie, uh... [whispers] it's a top secret surprise."
Pinkie Pie,A top secret surprise?! That means I have to keep the exciting news... [gulps] ...to myself!
Pinkie Pie,"Even though I didn't technically make a Pinkie Promise to Mrs. Cake, I can't tell Twilight or anypony the big news! That would make me a... a... a big old surprise ruiner! Right, Gummy?"
Pinkie Pie,Did you take that from Pound Cake again? Don't you know it's wrong to steal from a baby?
Rarity,What's all this about a baby?
Pinkie Pie,What? Who? What? Who said something about a baby?!
Rarity,"You did, Ms. Pie, just now. What were you talking about?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Great! Everypony's here. Now I don't have to wait any longer to tell you all the wonderful news! Somepony special is coming to visit Ponyville, and I need your help getting everything ready!"
Twilight Sparkle,It's...
Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle,Shining Armor and Princess Cadance!
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, and they're coming<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle,Tomorrow!
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, on the<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,Yes.
Pinkie Pie,Annnnnd?
Twilight Sparkle,And that's it.
Pinkie Pie,Oh.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, how did you know all that?"
Pinkie Pie,[nervous laugh] Uh... Pinkie Sense?
Rainbow Dash,"So, you said you needed our help with something?"
Twilight Sparkle,Follow me.
Rainbow Dash,Sweet posters! Is that Smash Fortune?
Twilight Sparkle,"It sure is! When Shining Armor said he wanted to come to the castle and visit, I started collecting things he liked when he was a colt as a surprise!"
Twilight Sparkle,I've been so excited that it's been hard to keep it to myself!
Pinkie Pie,[slightly muffled] I have no idea what that's like!
Fluttershy,"Aww, look at the cute little ant farm!"
Spike,And check out all these old comic books!
Twilight Sparkle,Be careful! They're mint-in-bag!
Pinkie Pie,What's this?
Twilight Sparkle,This is Brutus Force. Shining Armor used to carry him around like his baby!
Rarity,"It is a bit juvenile for castle d<e9>cor, but it is very sweet of you."
Fluttershy,I'm sure Shining Armor will love it.
Twilight Sparkle,"Me, too. But there's a few more things I'd like to add before he gets here, and I could really use a hoof collecting them."
Applejack,"Whatever you need, sugarcube, we'll help you get it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks, everypony! I just can't wait 'til they walk in and see everything!"
Rainbow Dash,Totally understandable. Watching somepony else be surprised with something is almost better than being the one who's getting the surprise!
Pinkie Pie,"But... eh... what if the surprise is something so incredibly exciting that a pony can't keep it in any longer, and she has to tell the pony standing next to her what it is or she might explode?!"
Fluttershy,I would say... no.
Rarity,The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!
Pinkie Pie,[nervous laugh] Gotta bounce!
Rainbow Dash,"So, I know the bar is set pretty high, but does anypony else think Pinkie Pie was acting weirder than usual?"
Pinkie Pie,"[heavy breathing] Phew, that was close! Too close. I almost spilled the beans. Beans that would be really hard to clean up! I obviously can't be around my friends right now. Or anypony for that matter! Hmmm... That's it! If Shining Armor and Cadance are coming tomorrow, then all I have to do is lock myself in my room away from everypony until they arrive! Then I won't ruin anything!"
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Oh, good, you're back! Mrs. Cake needs my help, but these deliveries can't wait! I can't thank you enough for agreeing to be my backup delivery pony, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie,I... did?
Mr. Cake,Mr. Maybe I should hire somepony to be my backup delivery pony.
Pinkie Pie,I'll do it!
Mr. Cake,Mr. Really?
Pinkie Pie,"Sure! There's no possible way that I could ever have anything that might interfere with doing that task, like a gigantic, emotionally exhausting surprise that would make it super hard to be around other ponies."
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Great! Uh, you're sure you won't change your mind?"
Pinkie Pie,"No way! Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, yeah. I Pinkie Promised I'd do it. And I never break a Pinkie Promise! Never!"
Mr. Cake,"Mr. Well, thanks again! You're a real cake-saver!"
Pinkie Pie,"[deflates, sighs] Hm. Maybe it'll be a quiet day and I can just avoid everypony!"
Apple Bloom,"Hiya, Pinkie Pie!"
Sweetie Belle,Heard any good gossip today?
Scootaloo,"Yeah, we're bored. Please say you have some interesting news."
Pinkie Pie,Nope!
Fluttershy,You were in such a rush earlier. Twilight wanted me to ask you if you would bring some snacks to the castle for Shining Armor and Cadance's visit.
Pinkie Pie,Definitely! Got it! Pinkie Promise! Yeah! Heh.
Fluttershy,"You know, maybe some baby carrots..."
Pinkie Pie,[nervous laugh] What did you say?!
Fluttershy,Baby carrots! They're Shining Armor's favorite.
Pinkie Pie,"Mine too! Baby carrots are kinda like big carrots but smaller, kinda like how foals are tiny versions of their parents but smaller and cuter and<U+0097> Albino squirrel!"
Fluttershy,Where? Is it Albert?
Pinkie Pie,It's time to kick this operation into hyper-hoof and avoid all ponies by any means necessary!
Pinkie Pie,It didn't feel good ignoring my friends like that... Maybe I can tell just one little pony the surprise?
Rarity,[with reverb] The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!
Pinkie Pie,"You're right, spooky-reflection-of-Rarity-that-I-know-is-actually-my-own-imagination. I can't tell anypony at all! [sighs] Then they would tell Twilight, and she wouldn't be surprised, and it would be all my fault."
Pinkie Pie,"[sighs] Finally, I'm all aloney on my owney."
Pinkie Pie,"Wow, great idea! I'm starving too! [chewing] [with mouth full] This apple is delicious! [swallows] What are you having, Gummy? Oh, no! It's the list that Twilight helped me make yesterday so I wouldn't forget all of my Pinkie Promises today! And I have three more things to do! Aw, four if you count bringing those snacks to Twilight's castle! I've been getting liberal with those Pinkie Promises lately..."
Sweetie Belle,Ooh! I want a flamingo!
Apple Bloom,I want a goldfish!
Scootaloo,Surprise me!
Scootaloo,Is that a... baby bottle?
Pinkie Pie,"[screams] No! It's a... a... puppy! Ha ha, woof woof, ha ha! Eh..."
Scootaloo,Are you sure? Because it looks like a<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,Next!
Featherweight,"Uh, a baby pony, please! Uh, unless of course that would be a royal pain..."
Pinkie Pie,"Interesting choice of words, Featherweight."
Featherweight,Was it?
Pinkie Pie,I don't know. Was it?
Featherweight,"Uh, maybe you'd better just make me a giraffe."
Mayor Mare,"My, your friends weren't kidding when they said you had a great filing system, Pinkie! You are Ponyville's best kept secret!"
Pinkie Pie,"No, I'm not!"
Mayor Mare,"[hushed] Speaking of secrets, have you ever known somepony else's secret?"
Pinkie Pie,Noooooo...
Mayor Mare,[hushed] A surprise that was so big and exciting that it was all you could think about?
Pinkie Pie,Nope!
Mayor Mare,[strangled sigh] Me neither...
Others,"""Wooden Legs"": [laughing] That's just what I wanted. Thanks, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie,You're welcome!
Others,"""Wooden Legs"": Oh, by the way, can you help spread the word about the big crib sale I'm having?"
Pinkie Pie,"[reading] ""Treat your foal like... royalty""?!"
Others,"""Wooden Legs"": [laughing] Pretty good slogan, huh? I came up with it all by myself!"
Others,"""Wooden Legs"": Oh. I thought it was clever."
Twilight Sparkle,"Those look yummy, Pinkie! Let me help you! But we better cover them up so they don't get spoiled."
Pinkie Pie,Why would they get spoiled? We're all gonna eat them super soon!
Applejack,"Oh, didn't anypony tell you? Shining Armor and Cadance are held up. They may not arrive 'til Saturday."
Pinkie Pie,Whaaaaaaaaaat?! [hyperventilating] You mean... [breathes] I have... [breathes] to wait... [breathes] another whole day?! I don't know if I can!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, do you have something you need to say? You seem like you've been keeping something in."
Fluttershy,We're here to listen.
Applejack,"Well, go on then, sugarcube."
Rarity,"We're not going to judge you, darling."
Spike,You'll feel so much better once you get it off your chest!
Rainbow Dash,Come on.
Rainbow Dash,"Whatever it is, you can tell us! We're best friends! [with reverb] Friends! Friends! Friends!"
Twilight Sparkle,[with reverb] Tell!
Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle,[with reverb] Tell! Tell!
Main cast sans Pinkie Pie,Friends! Friends! Friends! Tell! Tell! Tell!
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, okay, you win! [inhales] Shining Armor and Cadance are gonna have a<U+0097>"
Shining Armor,An awesome weekend with the best little sister in all of Equestria!
Princess Cadance,"[giggles] Hi, everypony."
Twilight Sparkle,"Shining Armor, Cadance! You're early! I thought something had come up and you weren't gonna make it until Saturday!"
Princess Cadance,"So did we. Turned out we weren't needed in Maretonia until next week. And the summit we were supposed to attend today had to be rescheduled, so... we got here even sooner than planned!"
Shining Armor,Surprise!
Princess Cadance,It's wonderful to see you all again!
Applejack,"Well, the pleasure's all ours, Princess."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm so glad you're here! I have a big surprise for you!
Shining Armor,"Oh, yeah?"
Shining Armor,"[hushed] Lucky we came when we did, huh? I'm guessing you saw the scroll we sent to Mr. and Mrs. Cake? Hey, I'm impressed you've been able to keep our secret this long!"
Pinkie Pie,So you're gonna tell Twilight now?!
Shining Armor,"[hushed] You're gonna have to wait just a little bit longer. We have something special planned. It'll be worth it, I promise."
Pinkie Pie,It'd better be.
Applejack,"So, do you think Shining Armor liked his surprise?"
Twilight Sparkle,Didn't you see him? He couldn't stop raving about it!
Rainbow Dash,Where did Shining Armor and Cadance say they'd meet us? [stomach rumbling] I'm starving!
Twilight Sparkle,"In the town square. I wish they'd waited to walk over with us, but they said they had something to take care of first!"
Pinkie Pie,[through gritted teeth] They're gonna have a lot more to take care of soon...
Twilight Sparkle,What?
Pinkie Pie,Nothiiiiiiing!
Twilight Sparkle,That's odd. Usually they're quite punctual.
Rainbow Dash,Ughhh! I need a hayburger in my belly right now!
Rarity,What does it say?
Twilight Sparkle,"A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor used to set these up for me when I was a filly! At the end, there was always a big prize, like a new book, or several new books, or<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,We get the picture! You like books!
Applejack,So what's the first clue?
Rainbow Dash,I hope it's something about eating lunch!
Pinkie Pie,"[reading quickly] ""You've got a scroll, you're on a roll, why don't you take a peek where young ones spend their week? A piece of paper will continue this caper."""
Twilight Sparkle,"I've got it! ""Where the young ones spend their week."""
Applejack,I'm not quite followin'.
Twilight Sparkle,It's the Ponyville Schoolhouse!
Twilight Sparkle,"""A piece of paper will continue this caper."" [gasps] It's in the Foal Free Press!"
Rarity,"Ooh, look at that dress Mayor Mare is wearing in the social report! Why, it's stunning!"
Applejack,"Uh, didn't you make that, Rarity?"
Rarity,"Yes, what is your point?"
Pinkie Pie,"Focus, everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, there's really no time limit on these scavenger hunts, Pinkie."
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""Though this hall is rather small, in it you'll find files of all kinds. Take a look on the back of the birth certificate of Applejack."""
Applejack,I don't like where this is goin'.
Mayor Mare,Baby! A royal ba<U+0097>!
Pinkie Pie,A-hem?
Twilight Sparkle,Does anypony know where the birth certificates are kept?
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh! I do, I do! Go down that hall, then you take a left, then a right, then another right, then a slight left, and it's the third door from the right!"
Fluttershy,"Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you knew so much about town hall."
Pinkie Pie,There's a lot of things I know! That you don't know I know!
Fluttershy,"Oh, you're so cute."
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""This next place is where you can buy a table or chair, or some comfy beds to rest little heads""?"
Pinkie Pie,"Ugh, really? None of you? [groan] It's obviously the furniture store! Go in, go in, go in!"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know...
Pinkie Pie,"Daagh, fine!"
Rainbow Dash,"Wow, you're scary good at this, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,"[reading quickly] ""It seems we've saved the best for last. We hope that you have had a blast. Now it's time to take a break where you can get a slice of cake!"""
Main cast sans Pinkie Pie,Sugarcube Corner!
Pinkie Pie,[scoffs] That was an easy one.
Shining Armor,"Surprise! Twily, did you like the scavenger hunt?"
Twilight Sparkle,"It was perfect! Just like old times, except even better because this time I got to share it with my best friends! There's just one thing missing, isn't there?"
Shining Armor,What's that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Mmmm, the book prize at the end!"
Shining Armor,"[laughs] There's still a prize, but it's a little different this time."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. I don't understand.
Princess Cadance,All the places we sent you today had something in common.
Twilight Sparkle,First we went to the schoolhouse...
Twilight Sparkle,And then we read the Foal Free Press... After that we found Applejack's birth certificate... And then the last clue was under a crib.
Twilight Sparkle,Hmmm... School... foal... birth certificate... and crib... [gasps] Can it be? Are you two...?!
Princess Cadance and Shining Armor,We're having a baby!
Pinkie Pie,"A baby, Twilight! It's a baby! Woo-hoo!"
Twilight Sparkle,You mean... I'm going to be an aunt?! This is the best prize ever!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I love you guys! And I can't wait to meet your little foal!"
Shining Armor,Neither can we.
Pinkie Pie,"I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it! [squee] [pop] Go, Pinkie."
Princess Cadance,"[giggles] You did it, Pinkie Pie! You kept it a surprise! Thank you! Was it much trouble?"
Pinkie Pie,Happy Hearth's Warming Eve!
Applejack,"Shucks, Twilight! Y'all done it up nice and cozy in here."
Twilight Sparkle,We're about to hang our Hearth's Warming dolls if you wanna join us.
Applejack,"Oh, that's mighty sweet of you, but we're just stoppin' in to wish y'all a happy Hearth's Warmin' before we go."
Twilight Sparkle,I think it's sweet that your families are spending the holiday together.
Pinkie Pie,Picture the most fun-tacular thing you can think of. Now multiply that times infinity! Whoo! It's gonna be great!
Applejack,That's us. See you later!
Spike,Now can we open presents?
Applejack,But tonight is Hearth's Warming Eve. Everypony knows you don't open presents 'til tomorrow.
Twilight Sparkle,"When Spike and I spent our first Hearth's Warming Eve together, he couldn't wait all night to open his presents! Ever since then, we've always opened them the night before!"
Spike,It's kinda like our tradition!
Applejack,"That's not how our family does it, and I reckon it can't be how Pinkie's does it. Is it?"
Pinkie Pie,No sirree!
Twilight Sparkle,"To each their own, I suppose."
Pinkie Pie,"Agh! Gotta go, bye!"
Spike,Just what I always wanted! A book...
Porter Pony,Chancellor Puddinghead puddings! How 'bout a Windigo-frosted snow cone?
Applejack,"It's so excitin'! Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one roof!"
Pinkie Pie,Apples and Pies together again for the first time! Maybe. Unless we're related! Which maybe we're not. I think I just confused myself.
Applejack,"Friends or family, this here's about togetherness."
Apple Bloom,"[mouth full] Have you tried the Equestria flag crepes? The blue is blueberry! And don't tell Granny I saw, but her trunk is full of presents!"
Applejack,"Now hang on, sugarcube. You know Hearth's Warmin' isn't just about candy and presents, right?"
Apple Bloom,Uh-oh. That's your boring sisterly lecture voice.
Applejack,"'Fraid so! [clears throat] A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies weren't friends."
Pinkie Pie,[as unicorn pony] I don't like you! [as Pegasus pony] I don't like you either!
Applejack,"But then, the icy chill of the Windigos almost iced up everythin'. So the ponies decided to work together, and their friendship drove them nasty critters away."
Pinkie Pie,"[as Pegasus pony] Beat it, Windigos!"
Applejack,"Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, and Equestria was born."
Applejack,"Uh, what happened to the flag?"
Apple Bloom,Is that why we celebrate with a flag raisin' tomorrow?
Applejack,"Mm-hmm! And tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties of our ancestors."
Pinkie Pie,We do that too!
Applejack,Then we'll hang our Hearth's Warmin' dolls over the fireplace to remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night.
Pinkie Pie,That's what our family does too!
Applejack,"And tomorrow, we open presents!"
Pinkie Pie,Ah! We do that too!
Apple Bloom,Sounds like the Apples and the Pies do everything the same way!
Applejack,"""Rooftastic""?"
Pinkie Pie,"As in, I'm gonna stand on the roof and yell to everypony how rooftastic this is!"
Applejack,What if our families don't like each other?
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] I'm so excited to see you, Pinkie Pie. You too, Applejack. I hope you had fun sledding yesterday."
Applejack,How'd you know that?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Isn't it obvious? There are specks of extrusive andesite on your hoof. It's a mountain rock.
Granny Smith,"[hushed] Oh, she's good."
Pinkie Pie,How's school going?
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] If you thought quartz was high on the Mohs hardness scale, wait 'til I tell you about corundum."
Pinkie Pie,I missed you so much!
Apple family,Mm-hmm.
Applejack,This place looks amazin'!
Pinkie Pie,"Come on, everypony! Meet my super-mega-fun-derful family! Everypony, meet everypony!"
Igneous Rock,"Surely thy name is not but Granny Smith. I am called Igneous Rock Pie, son of Feldspar Granite Pie."
Cloudy Quartz,Thou shalt know me as Cloudy Quartz.
Igneous Rock,"May Providence favor thee well, and to thou comfort our humble homestead bring."
Granny Smith,"Y'all gabbin' with words real funny-like. Wh-wh-what'd you say them names were? ""Iggy""? And I'm just gonna call you ""Big Mama Q""!"
Limestone Pie,"Gaze into the eyes of Limestone Pie. Ma and Pa may own this rock farm, but I keep it running. Cross me and<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"Aye aye, Captain Grumpy! No one's gonna mess with your precious mine!"
Limestone Pie,Or Holder's Boulder!
Pinkie Pie,"[sighs] Everypony stay away from Holder's Boulder. There, you happy now?"
Applejack,And you must be<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"This is Marble Pie, my baby sister who's only a few minutes younger than me but she'll always be a baby to me, isn't that right? She's so excited to meet everypony! Oh, and she wishes you all a happy Hearth's Warming!"
Marble Pie,Mm-hmm.
Applejack,"[hushed, to Apple Bloom] Guess Pinkie Pie always did the talkin' for her."
Pinkie Pie,[whistles] Attention!
Limestone Pie,What'd I say about the boulder?!
Pinkie Pie,I'll just be a second. Everypony get settled in! There's plenty of room upstairs. And then it's time for Hearth's Warming Eve dinner!
Applejack,"[hushed] So far, so good, cousin!"
Pinkie Pie,Hee-hee!
Apple Bloom,"Oh, I can't wait to taste their fresh sweet rolls! They're my favorite part of Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner."
Granny Smith,I'm more of a six-layer bean dip filly myself!
Apple Bloom,"I love that too! Oh, Applejack, do you think theirs'll be even better than ours?"
Applejack,"Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least."
Pinkie Pie,Are you excited for dinner time? Because guess who is! Spoiler alert <U+0096> it's me!
Applejack,What about hot rolls and mulled cider and double-baked pot pie?
Granny Smith,"Uh, what about six-layer bean dip?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] We have rock soup.
Pinkie Pie,"Potato, po-tah-to. Double-baked pot pie, rock soup! Dinner is dinner. Am I right or am I right?"
Applejack,"Yeah, um, you know what? This is what we were expectin'! Right, everypony?"
Pinkie Pie,"[slurping, exhales] Is everything all right, Applejack?"
Pinkie Pie,"More rock, please!"
Pinkie Pie,"Eat up, so we can get to our Hearth's Warming dolls!"
Applejack,Now that's somethin' I know all about!
Pinkie Pie,Who wants a Hearth's Warming doll?
Applejack,Are you sayin' that rock is a Hearth's Warmin' doll?
Pinkie Pie,"Don't be silly, silly!"
Pinkie Pie,"Our dolls are these little pieces! Isn't that right, Marble Pie?"
Marble Pie,Mm-hmm.
Apple Bloom,Our dolls are... rocks?
Applejack,Uh... y'all don't have traditional crocheted dolls passed down in your family?
Pinkie Pie,"Aww, you're just a frown factory because you got a weird rock. Cheer up! I'm sure you'll do great in the flag finding mission!"
Applejack,The what findin' what now?
Pinkie Pie,"Limestone Pie, you're the judge! Big Mac, Marble Pie, you're team one! Apple Bloom and Maud, you're team two! Ma, Pa, you're gonna be with Granny Smith. Don't think of it as team old. Think of it as team three! And I'm with Applejack of course, since we might be cousins!"
Applejack,"So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'?"
Pinkie Pie,As everypony knows<U+0097>
Limestone Pie,Stay off Holder's Boulder!
Pinkie Pie,"Sheesh. When the three tribes united to form Equestria, the first flag was sewn by Nimble Thimble. It's tradition to raise a flag on Hearth's Warming to celebrate that famous day."
Pinkie Pie,But who gets to put the flag on Holder's Boulder?
Applejack,You mean on the flagpole?
Pinkie Pie,"No, silly, it goes on the highest point! And who's the lucky pony?"
Applejack,"Traditionally, it's the youngest<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"[quickly] On your marks, get set, go!"
Applejack,"Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on?"
Pinkie Pie,I'll explain on the way!
Applejack,I still don't understand.
Pinkie Pie,"Earlier today, Limestone Pie hid an obsidian stone. Whoever finds it gets to raise the flag!"
Applejack,"It's all just so... complicated, and... rock-based."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, how else would we do it?"
Applejack,I don't know. I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time.
Marble Pie,Mm-hmm.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Marble Pie,Mm-hmm.
Big McIntosh,Eeeeeeeeeyup.
Granny Smith,"So, how'd you meet this Iggy feller?"
Cloudy Quartz,We were chosen by the Pairing Stone and betrothed within a fortnight.
Igneous Rock,"The choosing stone decreed, ""Thou shalt love one another."" And lo, it was so."
Granny Smith,"Hoo-wee, I gots to look into this oldfangled choosin' stone thing. You reckon it knows any apple-farmin' hunks?"
Igneous Rock,Indeed so.
Cloudy Quartz,[simultaneously] Mmm.
Apple Bloom,What does the rock look like?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] It looks like something that formed when volcanic lava cooled quickly.
Apple Bloom,Oh.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Have you ever wished you could turn into a rock?
Apple Bloom,I had a dream once I was an apple.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] We have a lot in common when it comes to thinking about turning into things.
Pinkie Pie,"Found it, found it, found it!"
Applejack,"A picture? I've been lookin' for a real stone, Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie,"Um, that would be weird. Do you know what this means? I get to raise the flag, and now it's time to hide the presents!"
Applejack,Y'all hide your presents?
Pinkie Pie,"Of course! What's more fun than getting a present? Finding a present! Although, most years, nopony finds one."
Applejack,So nopony gets presents?
Pinkie Pie,"Eh, not usually."
Applejack,"So lemme get all this straight. You're only allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole, and to top it off, you don't even get presents?!"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, it doesn't sound very fun when you say it that way."
Applejack,"Well, how 'bout you picture this? Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag...?"
Pinkie Pie,Picturing it... Loving it...!
Pinkie Pie,"Goodnight, everypony!"
Applejack,"Goodnight, Pinkie Pie! [hushed] We've gotta do somethin', y'all! Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'!"
Granny Smith,Is that really what she said?
Applejack,"Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant."
Apple Bloom,These are their traditions.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,"[sighs] I know they have their traditions and we have ours, but I just want them to see how much better theirs could be."
Pinkie Pie,Hearth's Warming!
Igneous Rock,"Oh, my. Oh, my."
Limestone Pie,What. Happened. To. My. Farm!
Applejack,"It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style! We've been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit! Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because you're the youngest Pie! Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll never forget! And look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em!"
Pinkie Pie,"...Yeah, this is gonna be great! All the stuff she's said. Right, everypony?"
Igneous Rock,Pinkamena Diane Pie! Truly thou cannot favor this madness!
Pinkie Pie,"Well, I wanna be one big family!"
Limestone Pie,But what about what we usually do?!
Pinkie Pie,"I, um, well, I-I don't know! [tearing up] Don't make me choose!"
Applejack,"I didn't mean to cause a fuss... Why don't we just open presents around the flag pole? It'll be fun, you'll see!"
Maud Pie,Excuse me. You planted your pole on a fault line.
Limestone Pie,Nooooooooooooooo!
Applejack,"Oh, boy."
Pinkie Pie,You didn't have to ask them to leave!
Limestone Pie,They wanted to go! We don't need anypony forcing their way into our family!
Pinkie Pie,"This was all a misunderstanding, everypony! I know Applejack, and she'd never do anything bad to anypony!"
Limestone Pie,"Look around, Pinkie Pie! It's gonna take me ages to get this rock farm back on track! And how are we gonna lift Holder's Boulder?! This is all her fault!"
Pinkie Pie,Then it's my fault too...
Granny Smith,"Prob'ly best if we head back to Sweet Apple Acres. Maybe in time we'll be friends again, but for the now it's best if we give them a little space."
Apple Bloom,I wish we didn't have to. I really like Maud. She's sweet once you get to know her. They all are. Worst Hearth's Warmin' ever.
Granny Smith,"Eh, has anypony seen Applejack?"
Applejack,[sniffling] I really cracked the corn this time.
Pinkie Pie,[sniffling] I really popped the pi<f1>ata this time.
Applejack,Pinkie Pie?
Pinkie Pie,[yelps] What are you doing here?
Applejack,What are you doin' here?
Applejack and Pinkie Pie,[simultaneously] I came here to think! You did? So did I! [laughing] Aww.
Applejack,"I'm too ashamed to go back up there. Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop."
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, no one thinks that! Pushy, aggressive, mean... Oh, I'm not helping. Sorry."
Applejack,I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours. I don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into and the friends who love you like one. I really hoped we could be one big happy family. I guess not.
Pinkie Pie,Don't say that!
Applejack,"I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch."
Pinkie Pie,[crying] H-Ha... Happy Hearth's Warming.
Applejack,[tearing up] You too.
Granny Smith,"You want to know why Holder's Boulder's so danged important? [exhales] Well, now their great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Holder Cobblestone <U+0096> he found that boulder in a dragon's nest, older than time itself! He built the family farm around it, even though it was just an ordinary rock. It always brought them good luck."
Applejack,"Aw, crickets! That is important! I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em!"
Applejack,"[reading] To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie. Cousins forever."
Apple Bloom,You just found your first Pie Hearth's Warmin' present ever!
Applejack,[laughing] Only Pinkie Pie could hide a present on a movin' train. ...What a great tradition. [beat] Stop the train!
Pinkie Pie,"[straining] Come on... you... boulder, come on... agh!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'm pushing as hard as I can too.
Limestone Pie,"Rrrgh, it's hopeless!"
Applejack,Need a little help?
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Apples!
Limestone Pie,What do you want?!
Applejack,"I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away, I was tryin' to share ours. I was so focused on us bein' one big happy family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away. What I should've done was learn about yours and teach you about ours. And over time, we'd make new traditions together. I'm sorry, y'all."
Limestone Pie,"Well, don't just stand there! We got a boulder to move! And I'm in charge."
Pinkie Pie,I think we've just invented our first combined tradition! Pushing Holder's Boulder out of the quarry! [squeals] I can't wait for Applejack to knock it over next Hearth's Warming!
Pinkie Pie,"Marble Pie, you want to wish Big Mac a happy Hearth's Warming, don't you! And you too, right, Big Mac?"
Marble Pie,Mm-hmm!
Big McIntosh,[short giggle] Eeyup.
Granny Smith,"Eh, lemme see here, uh... 'If thou ask-eth me, uh, thou two art, eh, okay-eth in my book'."
Igneous Rock,'Yee-haw'.
Pinkie Pie,Happy Hearth's Warming!
Applejack,"Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie."
Apple Bloom,"Attention, everypony! Maud wants to sing some Hearth's Warmin' carols that she wrote!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] The first one is about rocks. They're all about rocks. [reading, deadpan] Hearth's Warming is great. Like calcium silicate. What a wonderful day. As good as mica or clay."
Fluttershy,"Fuzzy Legs, do you think you could secure those windows?"
Fluttershy,And you'll alert me if anything scary comes close to the cottage?
Fluttershy,"Oh, who am I kidding? When something scary comes close to the cottage! Please tell me my hiding place is ready."
Fluttershy,"Oh, look, you've filled it with everything I need to survive this awful night. Thank you. Thank you all! Now I don't have to step a hoof outside until this whole thing is over."
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! You don't have any carrots? Do we have any other fresh veggies you may enjoy?"
Fluttershy,Or maybe some hay? But that means I'll need to go out... on Nightmare Night!
Foals,"[singsongy] Nightmare Night, what a fright! Give me something sweet to bite!"
Foals,"[singsongy] Nightmare Night, what a fright! Give me something sweet to bite!"
Granny Smith,"Fluttershy? What're you doin' out and about? It's Nightmare Night, remember?"
Fluttershy,"How could I forget? Oh, I don't suppose I could borrow a few pieces of hay from you? I forgot to stock up on food for Angel, and you do seem to have quite a lot."
Granny Smith,We need it for the Apple Family Haunted Maze. [spooky voice] The scariest maze that there ever was. Who knows what lurks inside?
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sure I don't."
Granny Smith,Is that a mummified pony that just leaped out at ya?
Fluttershy,I don't know. Is it?
Granny Smith,And what's that crunchin' sound beneath yer hooves? Maybe it's the bones of ponies that didn't make it out alive!
Fluttershy,B-B-B-B-Bones?!
Granny Smith,And are those peeled grapes or a thousand slimy eyeballs starin' at ya from beyond the grave?
Fluttershy,Please tell me they're grapes!
Granny Smith,Huh. I wonder what got stuck in her craw.
Spike,"You think it's scary now, just wait until it's done."
Fluttershy,That's okay. I'll take your word for it.
Spike,"[grunts] Hey, wait a minute! It's Nightmare Night and you're here and not holed up in your cottage! Does this mean what I think it means?"
Fluttershy,That I foolishly forgot to stock up on food for Angel and had to go out to get him something but got spooked in town so I came here hoping Twilight had some lettuce I could give him?
Spike,Oh. I thought maybe you decided to come out with us tonight.
Fluttershy,"Goodness, no! I couldn't be out tonight. I just couldn't."
Spike,"Technically speaking, you already are out right now."
Fluttershy,Oh. I guess that is true.
Spike,So what if you stayed out a little longer with your friends? I know they'd be super excited.
Fluttershy,You think so?
Spike,"You would make them so happy if you joined in. They wouldn't believe their eyes! Come on, Fluttershy, what do you say?"
Pinkie Pie,"And then it got very, very quiet and suddenly they realized the balloons had never been inflated!"
Rarity,Did I ever tell you about the night that the mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes?
Rainbow Dash,What happened?
Rarity,"I just told you, darling. A mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes."
Fluttershy,"Hi, everypony."
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, what are you doing here? Is everything okay?"
Fluttershy,"Everything is fine. In fact, it's more than fine. I've decided to join you in your Nightmare Night festivities."
Rainbow Dash,[scoffs] Seriously? You? Out? Tonight?
Fluttershy,"Every Nightmare Night, I shut myself in my cottage and refuse to come out until morning. But it's just like when I was afraid to sing in front of anypony. If I hadn't given it a try, I never would've found out how much I enjoy it."
Applejack,And we'd have missed out on how great you sound.
Rarity,"Fluttershy with us on Nightmare Night? Why, that's positively the most wonderful news I've heard in ages!"
Pinkie Pie,You can get dressed up in a costume with us and play Nightmare Night games with us and eat candy apples with us!
Applejack,Don't forget the best part. Goin' through my family's corn maze!
Fluttershy,"Oh, right. The maze."
Applejack,"Uh, only if you're up for it."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I am! I am ready to take on Nightmare Night!"
Rarity,"Mummy? No. Headless pony? No. Vampire fruit bat? Ugh, definitely no. You see, Fluttershy, the beauty of Nightmare Night is that you don't have to dress up as something scary."
Rarity,Ooh! Yes. This one will look gorgeous on you. Period costumes are all the rage this year. What? No good?
Fluttershy,"What if we encounter something terrifying and need to get away quickly? All those layers could slow me down, or worse, make me trip!"
Rarity,Oh. I never... considered that. Never fear!
Rarity,"[hums] Ooh, now this is a real stunner! I call it ""Masquerade""! Just a simple black dress underneath but with this ornately decorated mask!"
Fluttershy,A mask?
Rarity,No?
Fluttershy,They can just be so difficult to see out of.
Rarity,"Yes, but this one has eyeholes."
Fluttershy,W-What about being able to see what's to the left or right of me?
Rarity,"I suppose your vision would be somewhat obscured. It's your first Nightmare Night out and about, and we do want you to be comfortable."
Fluttershy,What if I just wear the dress?
Rarity,"Oh, sure, dear. That's... fine. [to herself] It's so plain, it's frightening. [out loud] Oh, my! Look at all of you! My costumes fit you to a T!"
Applejack,"Hoo-wee, we're gonna have the best time!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Fluttershy, where's your costume?"
Fluttershy,I'm wearing it.
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] I get it! You're a robber escaping into the night! You're a ninja escaping into the night! You're black licorice escaping into the night!
Fluttershy,Close. I'm going to a masquerade ball. Without the mask.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, that's great! Isn't it great?"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, yeah."
Pinkie Pie,So creative.
Applejack,Great costume.
Pinkie Pie,I figured I'd save the really scary games for next year when Fluttershy's more used to it.
All but Rainbow Dash,"Round and round and round you go, where you stop nopony knows!"
Pinkie Pie,Okay... go!
Rainbow Dash,"[grunting] Good luck beating that, Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy,"Well, um, it's just that if I'm blindfolded and somepony were to leap out in front of me, I'd never have the chance to defend myself."
Rarity,"That's fine, darling. You don't have to do anything you don't want to."
Twilight Sparkle,We're just glad you're here.
Pinkie Pie,We don't have to finish that game. I have another one I know you'll love! Bobbing for apples!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, what's wrong?"
Fluttershy,"It's just that, um... What happens if, when my head is deep down in the water, some kind of scary monster appears? How would I even hear to know I was under attack?"
Pinkie Pie,Time for candy!
Fluttershy,It is?
Pinkie Pie,"I made candy bags. Each bag has been made with each of you in mind, complete with each of your favorite candies!"
Rainbow Dash,Ha! Awesome!
Pinkie Pie,Here. Take it. Take it! What are you waiting for?
Fluttershy,"Well, it's just... What if when I'm eating one of these chewy taffies, my mouth becomes glued shut and I can't scream for help?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, goodness. We've only just started to celebrate Nightmare Night together, and I'm already taking all the fun out of it, aren't I?"
Pinkie Pie,You're not taking out all of the fun.
Rainbow Dash,"Just, like, ninety per<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,...Some of it.
Fluttershy,I really wanna do this. But there's just so many things that terrify me about tonight. I couldn't possibly predict what might upset me.
Twilight Sparkle,Unless... you were the one doing the scaring!
Rainbow Dash,Her scaring us? [laughing] Oh. You're being serious.
Twilight Sparkle,"The thing you hate is being scared, but if you're the one doing the scaring, then..."
Fluttershy,Then I can help you all have fun and I can still be a part of Nightmare Night!
Twilight Sparkle,So you like that idea?
Fluttershy,"I think I do! And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I think I have the perfect idea for how I'm gonna do it!"
Pinkie Pie,"Really? Oh, this is so exciting!"
Fluttershy,"[spooky voice] Meet me at my cottage in an hour. [normal voice] Oh, I'm excited to see everypony soon!"
Fluttershy,[spooky voice] Welcome to Fluttershy's tea party!
Rainbow Dash,"Did she just say ""tea party""?"
Twilight Sparkle,It sounds like it's a scary tea party?
Fluttershy,"[spooky voice] Have a seat. Don't be scared of what awaits you. Go on. Pass the sugar. Oh, no! There is none! You're a terrible host! Rarity, put your coat on!"
Rarity,Why would I do that?
Fluttershy,"[spooky voice] You need to cover up because no one has complimented your dressssssss! Pinkie Pie, look to your left and ask your best friend to pass the cucumber sandwiches!"
Pinkie Pie,Huh? I can't. There's nopony there.
Fluttershy,[spooky voice] That's right. Because she didn't care to show uuuuuup.
Pinkie Pie,What?
Fluttershy,"[spooky voice] A friend who didn't come through. That must scare you to the coooore. Quick, everypony, look behind you!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, what are those?"
Fluttershy,"[spooky voice] They're unplanned guests. Your woooorst nightmare. You don't have enough food for them! Oh, no! There's a tiny kitten that needs a home! But you are over-scheduled right now. You don't have time to help! I said, ""You don't have time to help!"" This should appear to scare you! [normal voice] Why don't you look terrified? You showed up to a party and everypony was extremely disappointed in you. Can you imagine anything more upsetting?"
Rarity,"It was a really good try, darling, but the scares at Nightmare Night are of an entirely different nature."
Twilight Sparkle,"It was really creative, though. I never would have thought of... all this."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm just not cut out for this. Just go on without me."
Rarity,"Oh, no. We couldn't possibly."
Fluttershy,You have to. This is the night you look forward to all year.
Pinkie Pie,We could... stay here?
Fluttershy,It's okay. I really want you all to have fun. This is how I spend every Nightmare Night. Please go. I'll be fine.
Pinkie Pie,"Eh, it's funny. I actually thought she had an idea for something really scary for a second there."
Applejack,She definitely tried her hardest.
Fluttershy,I did try my hardest.
Fluttershy,Or... maybe not. I suppose I could have gone with something a bit scarier. You're right! I've been taking baby steps! I think it's time for grown up ones! I don't suppose you have any ideas how I could do that?
Applejack,"Everypony's linin' up for the corn maze, y'all! Let's go!"
Spike,"Oh, yeah! I can't believe we're finally doin' this!"
Rainbow Dash,It's a good thing Fluttershy isn't here because she would never be able to handle this!
Big McIntosh,Boooo... Eeyup.
Rarity,What. Is. That. Sound?
Pinkie Pie,It looks like... bones!
Rainbow Dash,Looks like a bunch of dried sticks painted white to me.
Applejack,"Hey, try to keep up the illusion, would ya?"
Rarity and Spike,Gah!
Pinkie Pie,Whoo!
Applejack,Agh! What was that?
Spike,Don't you know?
Applejack,"Uh, o-of course I do. It was, uh..."
Rarity,[grunts] Fluttershy had a point with the layers on the dress.
Rarity,What is this? Is it a tunnel? Where does it lead?!
Twilight Sparkle,Which way are we supposed to go now?!
Applejack,"Uh, I don't know! I don't know what's goin' on!"
Rainbow Dash,[grunts] What do you mean? Didn't you help plan this?
Spike,"Applejack, didn't you know about any of this?!"
Applejack,"Alright, I got to admit I didn't know about any of this, but maybe they're just tryin' to make it interestin' for me, too! I'm sure Granny Smith or Big Mac is behind this."
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Applejack,[teeth chatter] That's what we were supposed to do! I don't know why we're down here! This is really scarin' me now!
Pinkie Pie,How did that get down here?!
Rainbow Dash,RUUUUUUUUUN!
Pinkie Pie,I can't see!
Rainbow Dash,I can barely move!
Rainbow Dash,It's like glue!
Fluttershy,"Oh, my! I'm so, so sorry. Can you ever forgive me?"
Applejack,Fluttershy?
Rainbow Dash,It was you the whole time?!
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe it!
Rarity,That... was...
Rainbow Dash,It was way more terrifying than the most terrifying thing I could have thought of!
Applejack,You out-nightmared the scariest part of the corn maze!
Twilight Sparkle,How did you do all this?!
Fluttershy,"After you left, I realized that I wasn't ready to give up on Nightmare Night. So I asked Granny Smith if I could try to make the maze even scarier for my friends."
Rainbow Dash,You came up with all of this?
Fluttershy,"I had some help. Angel was the scary figure that kept scurrying after you in the maze. Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall that made it difficult for you to see and move. And, of course, Harry was the especially scary monster."
Twilight Sparkle,Wow! That was inspired!
Pinkie Pie,You have to do this every year!
Applejack,Uh-huh!
Rarity,Absolutely!
Twilight Sparkle,Every year!
Rainbow Dash,Yeah!
Fluttershy,We could celebrate Nightmare Night together every year. But the truth is I really don't want to.
Pinkie Pie,You don't?!
Rarity,But you've done it. You found a way that we can all have a fabulous time together.
Fluttershy,"Yes, but I've also realized something. You all may love Nightmare Night and I may be good at being a part of it, but it's no fun for me to see my friends feel like they're in danger, even if I know they're not. I really don't like it. It's just not my cup of tea."
Pinkie Pie,Spoooooooooky tea?
Fluttershy,"No. Just regular tea. We do lots of fun things together, but I'm afraid this just isn't gonna be one of them. Actually, I'm not afraid. I'm perfectly fine with it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Then we are, too."
Fluttershy,[sighs] I don't know why I doubted myself for a second. Now this is what I call a perfect Nightmare Night.
Spike,[sighs] Didn't we just shelve all the books in the library a few months ago?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, but that was because we needed to! This is just because I want to! I call it my ""book-sort-cation""! Three uninterrupted days of reorganizing books. Can you think of anything more relaxing?"
Spike,"Well, claw massages, back rubs, bubble baths... You weren't really looking for an answer, were you?"
Twilight Sparkle,I've even devised a better system for organizing them. It decreases the amount of time it takes to find a book you're looking for by nearly three quarters of a second!
Spike,[flatly] Whoa. That much?
Twilight Sparkle,"Look at them all. Why, there must be at least twenty thousand books to organize!"
Twilight Sparkle,Best long weekend ever! I'm sure we can make some time for a claw massage and a back rub too.
Spike,Yes! Best long weekend ever!
Spike,Whoa! That strange yellow orb in the sky! What is that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Alright, alright, so it's been a little while since we've seen the sun."
Spike,A little while? We've been in that library for three straight days!
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, but they were three very productive days! Even if you did take that two-hour claw massage break."
Spike,"Hey, you promise a claw massage, I'm getting a claw massage."
Twilight Sparkle,It's not like we missed anything.
Rainbow Dash and Discord,"Hello, Twilight! Hi, Spike!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hi, Rainbow Dash. Good to see you, Discord."
Spike,Did you rehearse before you found us?
Rainbow Dash and Discord,What makes you think we practiced?
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, Rainbow Dash. What's going on here?"
Rainbow Dash,[laughing] Sorry. Me and Discord are just messin' around. Like we do.
Twilight Sparkle,Since when?
Rainbow Dash,[laughing] Sneaky snake!
Discord,[laughing] Just snaking around!
Twilight Sparkle,It is?
Rainbow Dash,Kind of an inside joke from this weekend. You wouldn't really get it unless you were there.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. Okay.
Rainbow Dash,"Cool. Well, uh, catch you later, Twilight!"
Discord,"[laughing] Catch you later, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"That was strange, right? Since when have Rainbow Dash and Discord had inside jokes?"
Spike,"Since sometime in the last three days, I guess."
Twilight Sparkle,Hey! Nopony made you join me on my book-sort-cation.
Spike,"I'm jokin', I'm jokin'!"
Twilight Sparkle,Rarity?
Rarity,[gasps] Twilight! You've returned from your book sorting sabbatical! All that organizing has done wonders for your complexion!
Twilight Sparkle,Thanks! It was very relaxing. And we were able to clear a shelf for those old-fashioned books you wanted to donate.
Rarity,"Oh, pfft, they're not old, darling. They're vintage, and they're over there! I've even included my favorites by former Canterlot designer to the stars Rococo Froufrou!"
Spike,"Oh, I love her!"
Rarity,Him.
Spike,[laughs nervously] Both.
Discord,Twilight! This makes twice I'm seeing you in one day! Aren't I lucky?
Twilight Sparkle,Weren't you just with<U+0097>
Fluttershy,"Hi, Twilight! Hi, Spike! How was your book-sort-cation?"
Twilight Sparkle,It was good!
Fluttershy,[giggles] Orange you glad you did it?
Fluttershy,"Oh, please. You'll make me blush."
Discord,You do seem to be turning a shade of... [gasps] orange!
Rarity,"Oh, sorry, darling. You see, we were at Sweet Apple Acres and, uh, ooh, how to explain..."
Discord,"Well, let me try and paint her a picture, dearest."
Spike,"[to himself] ""Dearest""?"
Discord,"[imitating Bob Ross] You see, we were all at Sweet Apple Acres, and I ended up turning the trees into the most<U+0097> [normal] Oh, who am I kidding? I simply can't do it justice. You really had to be there."
Fluttershy,"We would've invited you to come along too, but we didn't want to interrupt your organizing. We know how important it is to you."
Twilight Sparkle,"I appreciate that... Speaking of books, I should get these on the shelves."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hmm. Rainbow Dash bonding with Discord, Rarity finding something he did genuinely funny... Must've been some weekend."
Spike,Somepony sorry she missed it?
Twilight Sparkle,Of course not.
Twilight Sparkle,What's got you two in hysterics?
Discord,"[gulps] Oh, we were just reminiscing about the best weekend ever!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] He's everywhere today, isn't he?"
Discord,"Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes, we had just finished our soup, and then Applejack said, [imitating Applejack] ""Peanut butter hoof? Yuck, not even with jelly!"""
Twilight Sparkle,"Eh, I don't get it."
Pinkie Pie,[laughing] It was hilarious! I wish we'd taken a picture for you!
Discord,"Oh, well, this should do!"
Twilight Sparkle,I guess that's funny?
Pinkie Pie,[within laughter] Sticky situation!
Applejack,"Aw, shucks, Twilight. We haven't even asked how your weekend went."
Twilight Sparkle,It was fine!
Twilight Sparkle,I am not glum. I'm glad! I'm glad you all had such a good time together. Having inside jokes can really create a lasting bond between friends.
Discord,I'm just sorry that all this bonding happened while you were holed up in your castle.
Applejack,"Heh. Oh, don't you worry about Twilight. Bet you were in hog heaven organizin' all them books. Again."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm sure I had just as much fun as the rest of you.
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe I missed out on all that bonding!
Spike,[gulps] I knew it! You are jealous!
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, I'm the Princess of Friendship. I don't get jealous. I'm sorry I missed out because sharing that experience would've helped me with my Princess of Friendship duties!"
Spike,[chewing] [mouth full] Come again?
Twilight Sparkle,"If our friends could enjoy three full days with Discord that much, it must have something to do with the specific things they did together! If we could find out what those things were, it could be a real breakthrough in the science of friendship!"
Spike,Hm. I guess so.
Twilight Sparkle,I know so! You thought our book-sort-cation was fun? This is gonna be even better!
Twilight Sparkle,Thank you for coming. I wouldn't have asked you here if it wasn't important.
Pinkie Pie,I love important!
Twilight Sparkle,I want to know how these funny moments you shared came to pass. I can use this data to help advance friendships all over Equestria.
Applejack,"Well, I like the sound of that!"
Twilight Sparkle,Perfect. Let's start with the snake.
Rainbow Dash,I don't know if I can get it out! It's too funny!
Discord,"Oh, but we must! It's for the greater good! It started when we were helping Granny Smith with her garden..."
Applejack,"Uh, I reckon you mean my sister Apple Bloom."
Discord,Eh... All you Apples look the same. And then Rainbow Dash saw a snake!
Fluttershy,I think it was a garden hose.
Rainbow Dash,It was a hose snake. Super deadly.
Applejack,"I recall it bein' a large stick that looked like a hose that, in turn, did in fact resemble a snake."
Pinkie Pie,"Point is, we galloped away."
Rainbow Dash,And it chased after us!
Twilight Sparkle,The hose? A snake? A stick?
Rainbow Dash,A snake!
Fluttershy,A hose!
Applejack,A stick!
Discord,We literally trotted for our lives. Isn't that hilarious?
Fluttershy,I guess you had to be there.
Twilight Sparkle,I do need to be there.
Rarity,"But you weren't! And it's already happened! Ooh, are you suggesting..."
Pinkie Pie,Time travel?!
Twilight Sparkle,Absolutely not! Time travel is not something to be messed with. We simply need to recreate everything that led to these jokes.
Discord,"Oh, what a brilliant idea! Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off the glorious weekend you missed out on?"
Twilight Sparkle,Are you sure it was this table?
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, does it really matter?"
Twilight Sparkle,"When it comes to science, everything matters. One change to the equation could ruin the experiment."
Discord,Ohhhhhh... it was this table here.
Twilight Sparkle,"Alright, so you sat down at the table, and then what happened?"
Rarity,"Oh, well, first I expressed my displeasure with the design of the menu. It<U+0097>"
Discord,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed something."
Twilight Sparkle,Yes?
Discord,The tablecloth. It isn't the same color as the one the restaurant used on the day in question.
Twilight Sparkle,...Really?
Rarity,He's right! The tablecloth was red! I remember because it clashed with the font on the menus.
Applejack,"I don't suppose that means we're gonna need to get a new tablecloth, does it?"
Discord,"Oh, most definitely."
Fluttershy,Ooh.
Pinkie Pie,Wowee!
Discord,One change to the equation could ruin the experiment. Twilight said so herself. Anything stand out as being different? Anything at all?
Fluttershy,"Um, I've noticed a couple of things."
Pinkie Pie,Me too!
Discord,Excellent!
Discord,"A little to the left! No, my left! A little bit more... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, a little more right!"
Pinkie Pie,The cloud over our table looked like an ice cream sundae!
Pinkie Pie,Perfect!
Discord,"No-no-no-no-no, this is barely room temperature! Gar<e7>on! Gar<e7>on, over here!"
Discord,No? Nothing?
Twilight Sparkle,Are you sure there's not something you've missed? Some other detail about your lunch together that you're forgetting?
Discord,"Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts to recreate every single detail of our previous encounter."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, Twilight. If you don't get it by now, I don't think you're ever gonna get it."
Twilight Sparkle,But it is really important that I figure this out. It's for the good of all Equestria!
Discord,"Well, perhaps we should have another look at the data we've collected. [gasps] Of course! There is one last variable that we haven't accounted for."
Twilight Sparkle,What?
Discord,You!
Twilight Sparkle,Me?
Discord,"You weren't there observing us. No matter how hard we try, we can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun exactly as it happened because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there."
Main cast sans Twilight Sparkle,Hmmm.
Pinkie Pie,He makes a good point.
Discord,It has only served to prove that moments of levity and bonding between friends simply cannot be recreated so that others might share in the experience.
Pinkie Pie,He makes another good point!
Rarity,"Oh, don't worry, darling. I'm sure there'll be plenty of other chances for you to share in the kind of [starts giggling] frivolity we had with Discord while you were away."
Fluttershy,[laughing] Absolutely.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm not buying it. Not for a second. There is definitely something else going on here, Spike!"
Spike,"[gulps] Or maybe there isn't, and you should just drop this whole thing and admit that you're a little jealous!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Even if I'm not able to laugh at what happened, I should be able to figure out why they find it funny. Why they think they had this amazing and hilarious time together. But I can't figure it out! It doesn't make sense!"
Spike,Some things just can't be explained.
Twilight Sparkle,"Our friends think something great happened to them while I was away, but no. It was something awful! If we don't break the spell they're under, who knows what terrible things could happen?!"
Spike,Spell?
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, Spike! There's no time to lose!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Zecora, what do you think? Can you undo Discord's magic?"
Zecora,In what way can you tell that they are indeed under a spell?
Twilight Sparkle,"They're having fun with Discord, that's why!"
Zecora,Ah. A friendship with Discord is truly a shock. But who says it is something that we must block?
Twilight Sparkle,"Trust me, they would never laugh like that unless something magical was involved. It's not that funny. I know funny."
Zecora,"Alright. This potion will break the spell, then you will be able to tell."
Spike,"Wait. If that's the potion, then what's brewing in your cauldron?"
Zecora,"It ties the room together and emits a warm glow. But if I am to be honest, it's just for show."
Applejack,[yawns] I wonder why she asked us here so bright and early.
Rarity,"Another map adventure, perhaps?"
Pinkie Pie,"Nope, no glowing tushies here!"
Fluttershy,Or maybe it's more of a non-adventure. Maybe she just wants to tell us how last night's slumber went?
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, gang!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, you look excited!"
Twilight Sparkle,I am excited! We're gonna have fun today!
Pinkie Pie,Yes!
Twilight Sparkle,"Just one tiny, minuscule, microscopic thing before fun times. I need everypony to sip this potion to break Discord's spell on you!"
Applejack,A what now?
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't be embarrassed. So what if Discord cast a spell on you so you thought you had a great time, and now you have all these inside jokes that you seem to be constantly laughing at? Don't worry! You didn't have your defenses up. I get it."
Rainbow Dash,You're kidding.
Rarity,"Twilight, darling, we simply had a nice time with Discord. As I recall, we spent much of yesterday afternoon reenacting it for you."
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-huh. Or you reenacted what you thought was fun but really wasn't because you were under a spell that made you think what happened was fun!
Applejack,"What kind of fertilizer have you had your nose in, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Be honest. The only reason you won't drink the potion is because, deep down in your hearts, you know there's a chance that Discord has you under his power!"
Fluttershy,"Twilight, how could you say such a thing?! I know Discord still makes mistakes sometimes, but you're accusing him of being downright evil!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! And to top it off, you're accusing us of not being able to tell he was up to something! What do you take us for?"
Pinkie Pie,Yeah! [glug] What do you [glug] take us for?!
Pinkie Pie,"Dee-licious! Got any more, Twilight?"
Discord,"Hi, Twilight! The gang mentioned we'd all be hanging out together today!"
Twilight Sparkle,"""The gang""?"
Pinkie Pie,[laughing] It's still funny!
Applejack,"[hushed] So much for that whole ""spell"" theory."
Twilight Sparkle,Ugh. But it's still not funny!
Rainbow Dash,It's funny if you were there.
Twilight Sparkle,"But I wasn't there! I wasn't included! Maybe it's my own fault for staying in and having a book-sort-cation when I could have been making jokes and memories and having a great time with my friends! But I didn't do that, did I?! You all did! You were all there, but<U+0097>! [sighs] I wasn't there. I missed out. And seeing you having all these jokes I wasn't a part of and couldn't understand made me..."
Spike,Jealous?
Twilight Sparkle,No. The Princess of Friendship can't get jealous.
Applejack,"Sure you can, Twilight, and none of us begrudge you for it."
Fluttershy,We're sorry if we made you feel left out.
Twilight Sparkle,You didn't do anything wrong. You're allowed to share things that don't include me.
Rarity,And you're allowed to feel a little jealous about it. You just have to be able to admit that that's what you're feeling so you can let it go.
Rainbow Dash,"And, you know, not try to make us recreate everything that happened when you weren't around."
Discord,Of course none of this would've happened if I hadn't encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend.
Twilight Sparkle,They wanted me to be there? And you convinced them to not invite me?
Discord,"Well, I didn't think that they should interrupt you. But now I see that we should have. Oh, I feel just terrible."
Pinkie Pie,You don't look like you feel terrible.
Discord,Better?
Applejack,"Wait a minute. You didn't suggest not inviting Twilight because you wanted to make her feel left out, did you?"
Discord,Of course not. That whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident.
Discord,"Certainly we can all agree that Princess Twilight learned a valuable lesson here <U+0096> that even she can have feelings of jealousy, that she should recognize said feelings rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them. Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the old me would have tried to do. Orange you glad I've changed?"
Discord,"I said, Orange you glad I've changed?"
Discord,"Orange! Like the ones at the Applejack farm! I-I mean, from this weekend!"
Discord,No? Nothing? Really? I thought you'd find this hisss-terical!
Rarity,"...Yes, no. Discord, I think these jokes have run their course."
Pinkie Pie,Only way we'd find them funny now is if you put us all under some kind of spell!
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, you'd have to be a complete crazy pony to think he'd do something like that! What are you gonna say next, Pinkie? That we all have to drink some weird potion to break the spell?"
Discord,W-W-What's so funny?
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Discord, do we really have to spell it out for you?"
Discord,I-I-I don't get it. Somepony want to tell me what's so hilarious? Anypony? Hello?!
Discord,"I'm talking to you! You! And-and you and you! W-W-What's funny about spells? I mean, really, I don't get it, I feel left out and I feel really bad about that..."
Spike,"Sorry, buddy. Guess you had to be there."
Fluttershy,"Does everyanimal have their copy of Wuthering Hooves? Hooray! I love Furry Friends Book Club! Now, let's discuss the theme of nature as it applies to Hoofcliff's love."
Fluttershy,"Did somepony leave a light on? Oh, it's me. Oh! It's me!"
Fluttershy,We'll continue this discussion when I get back!
Twilight Sparkle,You're here!
Twilight Sparkle,Isn't this exciting?!
Fluttershy,"Oh! You were called, too! Thank goodness. I feel so much better going with a friend."
Twilight Sparkle,"I was about to come and get you, but then I got distracted."
Fluttershy,Oh.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ever since the map called us, I've been doing a ton of research."
Twilight Sparkle,Testing out potential friendship problems.
Twilight Sparkle,Diversifying my solution portfolio.
Fluttershy,Ever since the map called us? But that happened five minutes ago.
Twilight Sparkle,"I know! But I wanna be one hundred percent prepared! I mean, I'm the Princess of Friendship. How would it look if I couldn't solve a friendship problem?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm so lucky I'm being sent with you. Speaking of which, where are we going?"
Twilight Sparkle,The Smokey Mountains!
Fluttershy,"Oh, I've never been there before."
Twilight Sparkle,Neither have I. And there isn't a lot of information on them. All I could find was this. The Smokey Mountains harbor the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria between its two majestic mountain peaks.
Fluttershy,"That's gorgeous. And where there's nature, there's a ton of animal friends!"
Twilight Sparkle,I can't wait to get started! I'm a little nervous since that's all I could find. I usually like to be a bit more prepared.
Fluttershy,You seem pretty prepared to me. Are those for us?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yep! I've prepared our things. Snacks, books, blankets, books."
Fluttershy,"You said ""books"" twice."
Twilight Sparkle,There are a lot of books.
Fluttershy,Ooh!
Twilight Sparkle,What do ya think our friendship problem's gonna be?
Twilight Sparkle,Do you think it'll be a problem about lying?
Fluttershy,[grunts] I'm sure we'll find out when we get there.
Twilight Sparkle,You're right.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ooh! Could it be about when two friends just randomly decide to do something together, but they forget to invite the third friend, and the third friend feels left out?"
Twilight Sparkle,Or where one friend tells another friend's secret after they asked them not to?
Fluttershy,"[exhausted] We'll know very, very soon. Since we're almost there."
Twilight Sparkle,Here. Lemme get that.
Fluttershy,[sighs] Thank you.
Twilight Sparkle,Sorry I've been a little skiddly-bopty-boo. I just can't believe this is finally happening!
Fluttershy,Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,Whoa! What in Equestria is happening?
Fluttershy,It's nothing like your book said it would be!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, boy. I'm feeling very unprepared. Where do we even start?"
Fluttershy,Maybe by figuring out where the flying pumpkins are coming from?
Ma Hooffield,Ready... Aim... Fire!
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, hi. Hello. Excuse us, but what are you doing?"
Ma Hooffield,We're pumpkinin' our neighbors!
Fluttershy,"Yes, but, um, why are you... ""pumpkining"" your neighbors?"
Ma Hooffield,"Well, because the McColts are just plain rotten. Hey, wait a tick. Who are you two?! You're not spies for the McColts, are ya?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship. And I am here to solve your friendship problem."
Fluttershy,"I'm Fluttershy, and... um... I'm here, too."
Ma Hooffield,"Ma Hooffield. Pleased to meet ya, but you're wastin' your time. We don't have a friendship problem. We have... a McColt problem."
Others,"""Buzzard Hooffield"": And there's absolutely no friendship there."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, maybe there could be if we figure out what the McColts did to make you so mad."
Ma Hooffield,"Oh, they done so many things. Why, just today, they shot pebbles at our farmhouse an' wrecked it. See, we're not very good at buildin', so all it took was a little pebble. But still!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, no!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I know what to do. We're gonna talk with these McColts and hear their side of the story. Once we have all the facts, we can put an end to this using reason and rationale."
Fluttershy,Good plan. [to mice] That's why she's the princess.
Twilight Sparkle,"In the meantime, could you please call off the pumpkining?"
Ma Hooffield,"Oh, alright."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks. C'mon, Fluttershy."
Others,"""Steel Bolts"": State your business!"
Others,"""Rosy Riveter"": Don't even bother. They're probably spies for the Hooffields."
Others,"""Steel Bolts"": Hey, wait! You're an Alicorn! I thought just the three princesses were Alicorns."
Twilight Sparkle,"There are four Alicorn princesses in Equestria now. I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship."
Fluttershy,And I'm Fluttershy.
Others,"""Steel Bolts"": We have a new princess? When did that happen? A-A-And how did the Hooffields come by a princess spy?"
Twilight Sparkle,We are not spies! [to Fluttershy] Why does everypony assume we're spies?
Big Daddy McColt,Because we don't get a lot of visitors. I'm Big Daddy McColt. You caught us at a weird time. We're in the middle of a giant feud with our... Terrible neighbors!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, actually, that's why we're here <U+0096> to solve your problem with the Hooffields."
Big Daddy McColt,So you're here to help us get rid of 'em.
Twilight Sparkle,No! That's not what I meant at all!
Big Daddy McColt,"Well, if you ain't fer us, you're agin' us."
Twilight Sparkle,We are not on anypony's side. We're here to help you become friends again.
Big Daddy McColt,"Well, that's gon' be hard. I don't believe we've ever been friends with the Hooffields!"
Twilight Sparkle,But you could be! They're just really upset you ruined their farmhouse.
Big Daddy McColt,Wait a hog-wogglin' minute! We only did that because the Hooffields pulled the pin out of our wagon wheel!
Big Daddy McColt,"A whole week's worth of food rollin' down the mountain. Us McColts are mighty fine builders, but we don't know the first thing about farmin'."
Big Daddy McColt,"We have to travel a ways away to buy our food. Now, we'll be stuck eatin' the pumpkins the Hooffields launched at us. Pumpkin bread, pumpkin soup, pumpkin [mispronounced] quesadillas, pumpkin paella, pumpkin cheese, pumpkin pie, pumpkin frittatas... Actually, that all sounds pretty good. But it'll get old!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Have you tried meeting at a neutral location, talking about your problems, and really listening to each other?"
Big Daddy McColt,What?! No! They'd sooner launch their dinners at us than listen to us.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, they'll listen to me. I'm an impartial third party."
Twilight Sparkle,"[voice amplified] Attention, Hooffields and McColts! I'm not on anypony's side, but I can see you're both wasting time and resources on being mean to each other. Ponies are supposed to help each other and be kind. So let's stop this senseless fighting! [speaking normally] There. That should do it. Ready to go home, Fluttershy?"
Fluttershy,"I'd love to. But if we solved the problem already, shouldn't our cutie marks be glowing again?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, yeah. They should be glowing any minute now..."
Twilight Sparkle,Or not.
Twilight Sparkle,So much for potential friendship solution number twenty-eight.
Fluttershy,I guess we should find out why the Hooffields are launching tomatoes now.
Ma Hooffield,"One at a time, Greenhoof. If you smoosh them tomaters in the slingshot, they won't break on the McColts."
Twilight Sparkle,What are you doing? I asked you to stop fighting.
Ma Hooffield,"Oh, is that what you were hollerin' about? We thought the McColts rubbed ya the wrong way. So we tomatered them for ya. My mistake. [to Hooffields] Stop the tomater slingshots!"
Ma Hooffield,Reload the tomater slingshots! We're gonna paint their mountaintop red!
Fluttershy,Bleh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, that didn't work. I was so sure it would."
Fluttershy,[gasps] It was a good plan. We need to think of another one. And soon. This fight is really affecting the animals around here.
Twilight Sparkle,"Not to worry. I'll just, uh..."
Twilight Sparkle,...find the root of the problem and work from there.
Twilight Sparkle,"Pardon us, Ma, but do you remember what started this whole feud in the first place?"
Ma Hooffield,They know what they did.
Big Daddy McColt,They know what they did!
Twilight Sparkle,I'm starting to think neither of you know what either of you have done.
Big Daddy McColt,"Sure, we do. Them Hooffields did us a grave injustice some time ago for some reason."
McColts,"Hear, hear!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, backup plan to the backup plan. Maybe we can find some common ground that you can bond over. What do you do when you're not fighting?"
Big Daddy McColt,That's easy. Gettin' ready to fight.
Fluttershy,What do you hope to get out of fighting?
Ma Hooffield,The satisfaction of winnin'!
Twilight Sparkle,Of winning what?
Big Daddy McColt,"The fight, of course! To prove our family is the best!"
Fluttershy,The best at what?
Ma Hooffield,Winnin'! Haven't you been listenin'?!
Twilight Sparkle,"So the only thing they have in common is that they both want to win a fight, and neither of them know what it's over. How can I end this feud if I don't know what it's about?"
Fluttershy,Ooh! Maybe somepony just needs to say they're sorry.
Twilight Sparkle,That's a good idea. And friendship solution number forty-eight. But we can move it up.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm so glad you agreed to do this. This apology cake will go a long way to making amends between you two. Which part of my argument changed your mind? The part where I said the benefits of friendship outweigh the cost of war, or the part where I said forgiveness is an investment in happiness?"
Ma Hooffield,"Yeah, yeah. All of it."
Twilight Sparkle,Wait. Are you even listening to me?
Others,"""Steel Bolts"": Who goes there?!"
Ma Hooffield,It's Ma Hooffield.
Others,"""Steel Bolts"": Hooffield alert! Arm the cannons!"
Ma Hooffield,With an apology cake!
Others,"""Steel Bolts"": Did you say ""cake""? As in... [slurps] cake?"
Ma Hooffield,Consider it a gesture of goodwill from us to you.
Others,"""Rosy Riveter"": I haven't had cake in ages."
Others,"""Steel Bolts"": Open the gates!"
Others,"""Hacksaw McColt"": [sniffles] Oh, it's such a bee-utiful cake."
Twilight Sparkle,Think of this as more than just a cake. It's the first step in the long road to forgiveness.
Fluttershy,"Nothing says ""let's be friends"" like a cake that says, ""Let's be friends!"" [hushed] I wrote that in icing on the top."
Hooffields,For glory! Whoa!
Big Daddy McColt,McColts! Assume Delta Force formation!
McColts,Yah!
Ma Hooffield,Ready... aim... fire!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ma Hooffield, you planted ponies in that cake?!"
Ma Hooffield,Yeah! [laughing] Wait. Were you serious about apologizin'? Why in Equestria would we do that? We didn't do anythin' wrong!
Big Daddy McColt,What're you talkin' about?! You done so many things wrong!
Ma Hooffield,Not as many as you!
Fluttershy,"Um, if you could just not yell so much or maybe stop saying words altogether..."
Fluttershy,Wah! Twilight?
Fluttershy,"Um, Twilight? We should probably get back there. I mean, if you need a break, that's fine, but I really can't do this without you."
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know if we can do this at all. Even if I make things right, they're just gonna fight again."
Fluttershy,"Hey, little fellas. Oh, that's okay, you can come out."
Twilight Sparkle,What was that?
Fluttershy,"Oh, you poor things! There isn't enough food here for you! Oh, brrr, and you're freezing! I'm gonna take you all home with me and get you all hot cocoas. How do you feel about book clubs?"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't get it. This was supposed to be the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria. What happened?
Fluttershy,What's that? Oh! Uh-huh... Twilight! They know what happened here!
Twilight Sparkle,What?
Twilight Sparkle,Stop! You have to listen to me!
Twilight Sparkle,[straining] Fluttershy! You have to tell them! [strains] It's a lot harder to freeze an army of ponies than just six of them!
Fluttershy,"[raised voice] Before you keep fighting, there is something you should know! Long ago, there were two best friends..."
Fluttershy,"[voiceover] ...Grub Hooffield and Piles McColt. When they found the valley between the Smokey Mountains, they knew it was something special. So they made a promise to each other to protect and preserve the valley for all its adorable furry inhabitants. But they disagreed on how to go about it. Grub wanted to start by planting crops so that everypony would have something to eat. But Piles thought it would be better to start by building a shelter to protect them against the cold and wind. The two ponies were unable to come to an understanding, so Piles went ahead and built a shelter anyway, exactly where Grub was gonna start his farm! Grub was upset, so he tore down Piles' shelter so he could plant his crops!"
Fluttershy,"[voiceover] They kept fighting back and forth, until it turned into a feud!"
Fluttershy,"[voiceover] The valley suffered from the constant destruction, until finally the Hooffields and McColts moved to separate mountains."
Fluttershy,"Even then, the valley and all the animals in it continued to be caught in the crossfire. You see? By fighting, you're destroying the very thing that brought you here in the first place! So it's time you both put your differences aside and come together! If not for yourselves, then for the sake of these cute and cuddly guys!"
Big Daddy McColt,"Aw, shucks, we never meant to hurt you little critters."
Ma Hooffield,"Yeah, we're sorry!"
Fluttershy,They say they accept your apology.
Big Daddy McColt,"Uh, princess? You can unfreeze us now."
Twilight Sparkle,"[straining] Oh, right!"
Big Daddy McColt,Ma Hooffield? We promise we won't fight you no more.
Ma Hooffield,"Us too, except we promise not to fight you. I suppose it doesn't matter who's right. We're both wrong."
Big Daddy McColt,That's one thing we can agree on.
Twilight Sparkle,This is wonderful! I am so proud of you two!
Ma Hooffield,"Aw, thanks, princess. Though I would just like to point out that I was the, uh, first to admit I was wrong."
Big Daddy McColt,"That may be, but I promised not to fight first. That counts for more!"
Ma Hooffield,"Oh, yeah?!"
Ma Hooffield,"Oh, all right. We don't have to speak animal to know what y'all are sayin'. Truce?"
Big Daddy McColt,Truce.
Big Daddy McColt,Woo-hoo! Ain't that a pretty sight?
Ma Hooffield,Sure is! The McColts are gonna help us rebuild our homes! Good ones this time.
Big Daddy McColt,And the Hooffields are gonna help us grow some crops!
Others,"""Steel Bolts"": Not pumpkins."
Ma Hooffield,Thanks for teachin' us that friendship is so much better than winnin' a silly argument.
Fluttershy,Yay! I told you we'd figure it out.
Twilight Sparkle,"We did, and we didn't need my friendship portfolio to do it. We just needed each other. So, what do you think will happen next? We've all been called by the map now."
Fluttershy,Oof! [straining] I'm sure we'll find out when we get home...
Twilight Sparkle,"What if it summons all six of us to another place? Or another pony we weren't expecting? [gasps] What if it wants us to solve other kinds of problems, like quantum physics, or why the apple doesn't fall far from the tree?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Applejack! Are you sure you've never managed a concert before?"
Applejack,"Well, it turns out doin' up a concert's the same as settin' up a rodeo."
Twilight Sparkle,"And thanks to Pinkie's connections organizing the Ponypalooza Rock Concert, we've got quite a lineup for the Helping Hooves Music Festival."
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight! Applejack! Rainbow Dash! Rarity! Fluttershy! Spike! Pinkie Pie! Oh wait, that's me. Everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle,"What is it, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie,I have the most amazing news ever! It is totally gonna freak your frizz!
Rainbow Dash,"Well, spill it, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie,"It wasn't easy. In fact, it was terribly difficult. But I have managed to book the biggest pony pop star in all of Equestria as the main attraction of the Helping Hooves Music Festival!"
Applejack,Sapphire Shores?
Pinkie Pie,"Sapphire Shores?! Please! Sapphire Shores is merely the second biggest pony pop star in Equestria. I have booked the one, the only, Countess Coloratura!"
Others,"Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Ahhh..."
Applejack,Who in the hay is Countess Coloratura?
Pinkie Pie,My frizz has been freaked!
Applejack,"Pinkie Pie, who is this Countess Coloratura pony?"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, I just told you that she's the biggest pony pop star in Equestria! How-how-how-how-how have you not heard of her?!"
Applejack,Don't know. Though I did know a gal named Coloratura when I was just a filly. [laughs and snorts] Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing if that Coloratura and this Coloratura were the same Coloratura? Heh.
Pinkie Pie,Do you mean to tell me that you actually know Countess Coloratura?
Applejack,"Well, I don't think it's the same pony, since my friend wasn't any sort of high-falutin' countess."
Pinkie Pie,Do you remember her cutie mark?
Applejack,Sure do. It had this super colorful bunch of musical notes that just shimmered in the light.
Pinkie Pie,You mean... like this?!
Applejack,"Well, fancy that! That there's the very same cutie mark!"
Pinkie Pie,Do you have any idea the number of hoops I had to jump through to get her to perform at the festival?! A whole lot of hoops! That pony is very demanding!
Applejack,Nah.
Pinkie Pie,Yah!
Rarity,I completely understand. We artistes require certain necessities in order to do our best work.
Applejack,"This was clearly some sort of misunderstandin', 'cause Rara was just as down home as me!"
Others,"Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Royal Riff, Spike, Rara?!"
Applejack,"Even that big name was too fancy for her, so I shortened Coloratura to ""Rara""!"
Applejack,[voiceover] We had the best time at Camp Friendship!
Applejack,[voiceover] Rara was just so easygoin'! We were like two apples from the same branch.
Applejack,"[voiceover] Rara and I prepared this song for the camp talent show. When we performed, she belted it out, singin' in the most colorful, clear voice I'd ever heard!"
Young Coloratura,"Equestria, the land I love A land of harmony Our flag does wave from high above For ponykind to see"
Others,"Equestria, a land of friends Where ponykind do roam They say true friendship never ends Equestria, my home"
Applejack,"[voiceover] After camp, we wrote to each other for a bit, but..."
Applejack,"...then we lost touch. But Rara always did want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big. But a demandin' diva? Just you wait, Pinkie. Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a plain old pony like you and me."
Pinkie Pie,I don't have to wait <U+0096> she's here!
Applejack,Really?
Applejack,Rara?
Pinkie Pie,[squealing] Countess Coloratura!
Svengallop,Clear the way! Stand back! Keep your hooves and tail to yourselves!
Applejack,"No... that can't be her. [clears throat] Um... hi. Remember me? We met at Camp Friendship? I gave you the nickname ""Rara""?"
Countess Coloratura,AJ?
Applejack,"Yeah! Heh. Howdy, Rara!"
Rarity,"Ooh, you got hoofsies from Countess Coloratura! Look! Ooh, she clearly thinks you're very special!"
Applejack,Yeah... real special.
Svengallop,"Now that's how you make an entrance! Big, bold, absolutely stunning! Though it was muddied a bit with your interaction with that dusty farmpony. Do you actually know her?"
Countess Coloratura,"Oh, yeah, that's my childhood fillyfriend AJ! She was the one that started calling me Rara."
Svengallop,"Oh, yes, how cute and... common. Of course, I was the one that started calling you Countess, and just look at how you've moved up in Equestria since then! Why, you've gotten everything you've ever wanted! Speaking of which, where is the pony Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh! I'm the pony Pinkie Pie, Mr. Manager, sir!"
Svengallop,Do you have the water imported from Rainbow Falls that I requested for Countess Coloratura?
Pinkie Pie,I have twenty glass containers full right here!
Svengallop,Did I not tell you to provide straws in all of Countess Coloratura's beverages?
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, I don't think so. But lucky for you, I have the biggest straw collection in Equestria! I call this straw Fernando."
Svengallop,"Hm. Let us confirm that you acquired the rest of the items that Countess Coloratura requested before she performs her run-through, shall we?"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, we shall!"
Svengallop,Floral arrangements from the royal Canterlot gardens... Chocolate <e9>clairs made by Gustave le Grand... A selection of crystals from the Crystal Empire... Freshly picked cherries from Cherry Jubilee's farm separated red from yellow...
Pinkie Pie,Abso-toot-ly!
Svengallop,"Well, by some miracle, your requests have been reasonably met. So let us move on... to rehearsal!"
Pinkie Pie,"See, Applejack? Demanding!"
Applejack,"Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara I knew didn't hide behind a veil givin' out fake stamp kisses, sippin' up imported water, and needin' her cherries separated."
Rarity,"Oh, I do understand. Sometimes it's hard to see our friends change."
Applejack,She's become a whole other pony!
Rarity,"Trust me. Once you see Countess Coloratura perform, you simply won't believe it!"
Countess Coloratura,Time for the spectacle Time for the show The lights are bright and the colors glow
Others,"I'm not just anypony I think you know The time is now, it's about to blow!"
Others,"Razzle dazzle Glitz and glam Turn it all up, it's a spectacle"
Others,"Razzle dazzle Glitz and glam Turn it all up, it's a spectacle"
Others,"Give me more Razzle dazzle Glitter eyes, big surprise Lights, cameras"
Others,"Razzle dazzle Glitz and glam Turn it all up, it's a spectacle"
Others,"Hear the applause Here to impress Not just a pony, I am the Countess!"
Applejack,Rarity was right! I don't believe it!
Svengallop,"Oh, my shining star! Thanks to the sparkling costumes, dazzling choreography, and brilliant vocal effects that I designed, your performance was spectacular, Countess Coloratura!"
Countess Coloratura,"Oh, [short laugh], thank you, Svengallop!"
Applejack,"Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller isn't actually complimentin' Rara. He's complimentin' all the bells and whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura."
Rarity,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you don't understand, Applejack. Creating all those elements is a lot of work, and Countess Coloratura's performance wouldn't exist without them."
Applejack,"If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing."
Countess Coloratura,"Oh, if we're all done here, I'd love to go back to my trailer and rest, Svengallop."
Pinkie Pie,"Actually, right now you're scheduled for your meet and greet with the schoolponies!"
Svengallop,"Ugh. I can totally get you out of meeting with the schoolponies, Countess."
Countess Coloratura,Absolutely not. My favorite part of any event is meeting with the schoolponies!
Applejack,"The schoolponies'll be so happy to hear that, Rara!"
Countess Coloratura,"Ponyville schoolponies! As part of the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I'm holding a contest where some of you will get a chance to sing with me onstage at the concert tomorrow! Sound fun?"
Countess Coloratura,Alright! Now who wants more hoofsies?
Applejack,Now that's more like the Rara I remember.
Pinkie Pie,[distant] But... I got everything you requested!
Svengallop,That was for Countess Coloratura! This is for me! And what I want is premium oats!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh! Well, we have lots of tasty oats right here in Ponyville!"
Svengallop,"I would not feed those to a chicken! I want top-of-the-line Appleloosan oats! Next, it appears that we are surrounded by apple trees. Bring me five hundred pre-peeled, pre-cored apples, and I want those things in twenty-four hours!"
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] But that's impossible!
Svengallop,Do you want me to pull Countess Coloratura from your little podunk charity show?! Because I will!
Pinkie Pie,Applejack! Svengallop just made all of these new demands and he said<U+0097>
Applejack,"I heard, Pinkie. But don't you fret. I'll talk to Rara and fix things right up."
Apple Bloom,"Did'ja see, sis?! Did'ja see?!"
Countess Coloratura,"Is this the little sister you wrote to me about, AJ?"
Apple Bloom,"Hold on, Applejack. You wrote to Countess Coloratura about me?!"
Countess Coloratura,"AJ said you were the best little sister ever, Apple Bloom!"
Applejack,"Alright now, you'd best get along, little ponies."
Applejack,"Uh... Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk to you about your manager?"
Countess Coloratura,"Sure, what about him?"
Applejack,"Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie."
Countess Coloratura,"Svengallop works very hard as my manager, AJ, so if he needs some things when we're on the road, I don't see anything wrong with that."
Applejack,"Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd pull you from our charity festival?"
Countess Coloratura,"What? But he knows how important charity is to me, and leaving the festival would completely ruin my image!"
Applejack,I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work.
Countess Coloratura,That's not true! Svengallop has always supported me in all my interests. You're just saying those things because you're jealous!
Applejack,"Jealous of what? A pony who hides behind a veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her? No, I'm not jealous of that, Rara!"
Countess Coloratura,"I am not Rara! I am Countess Coloratura! And while we may have been friends when we were young, we have clearly gone in different directions!"
Applejack,"It just ain't right! He's manipulatin' her, and she's just not seein' it!"
Pinkie Pie,"Enough stewin', more peelin'!"
Applejack,"Sorry, Pinkie, but there is no way I'm lettin' that lousy Svengallop use my friend like that!"
Applejack,Countess Coloratura!
Countess Coloratura,"Wow, AJ, you said my real name."
Applejack,"I said your new name, but I saw the real you hangin' out with those schoolponies yesterday. And I know somepony that'd prefer if you stop doin' those little events."
Countess Coloratura,"Ugh, not this again."
Applejack,Come on now. You've just got to give me a chance to prove what I'm sayin' is true.
Countess Coloratura,And just how are you going to do that?
Applejack,Do exactly what I say. We'll see if that Svengallop truly has your best interests at heart.
Countess Coloratura,"Svengallop? Svengallop! Where are you, Svengallop?"
Svengallop,Here I am! Did you need something?
Countess Coloratura,"Yes, I was... considering... m-maybe cancelling the contest with the schoolponies...?"
Svengallop,"Countess, this is wonderful! I've been waiting forever for you to cancel that pointless schoolpony contest."
Countess Coloratura,You... have?
Svengallop,"You do it at every charity event, and it does absolutely nothing to promote the Countess Coloratura image that I built! Consider it cancelled. Pinkie Pie!"
Svengallop,We are making some adjustments to the show. Follow me!
Svengallop,"Cancel the contest for the fillies and schedule me a spa treatment. Now that I don't have to oversee a rehearsal with those brats, I have time for the works! You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!"
Svengallop,"Okay, Countess Coloratura, all taken care of!"
Svengallop,"[amplified] You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!"
Countess Coloratura,So that's how you've been managing things?
Svengallop,"Yeah, so? What's the problem?"
Countess Coloratura,"The problem is, is you've been using my name to intimidate ponies to get what you want!"
Svengallop,But I work incredibly hard for you! I deserve everything I get!
Countess Coloratura,But not because you scare ponies into thinking I won't perform for their charities otherwise! I would never do that to my fans! Which is why you should have known that I would never cancel the schoolponies' contest!
Svengallop,Hmph. All this charity and schoolpony contest nonsense is just remnants of that boring little Rara I met back in Manehattan!
Countess Coloratura,You clearly don't understand the real me!
Svengallop,"Ha, that's a joke! I made you somepony! What can you even do without me? Good luck, Countess Coloratura! Good luck."
Applejack,"Oh, Rara, I'm so sorry. Are you gonna be okay for the concert tonight?"
Countess Coloratura,"Of course. After all, the show must go on!"
Coloratura,"Oh, my gosh, Rarity, Svengallop's right! This is gonna be a disaster! I'm gonna be terrible!"
Applejack,"Can you give us a minute, Rarity?"
Rarity,Certainly.
Applejack,"Now, why's it gonna be so terrible?"
Coloratura,"Because Svengallop was in charge of everything! The lights, the visuals, the sound! Without Svengallop, I have nothing!"
Applejack,"Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a tizzy there, Rara. Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a star. But the real perk of friendship is gettin' to see your friend bein' true to their self. And Rara, when you're simply yourself, you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine."
Twilight Sparkle,"Good evening, everypony! Welcome to opening night of the Helping Hooves Music Festival! Now it is my great honor to introduce you to our headlining act <U+0096> Countess Coloratura!"
Coloratura,"This song may be familiar, but yet, it's totally different. Kind of like me, Rara."
Coloratura,"I'm here to show you who I am Throw off the veil, it's finally time There's more to me than glitz and glam, oh-whoa And now I feel my stars align"
Others,"For I had believed what I was sold I did all the things that I was told But all that has changed, and now I'm bold 'Cause I know"
Others,That I am just a pony I make mistakes from time to time But now I know the real me And put my heart out on the line
Others,And let the magic in my heart stay true Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa And let the magic in my heart stay true Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa Just like the magic inside of you
Others,And now I see those colors Right before my eyes I hear my voice so clearly And I know that it is right
Others,"They thought I was weak, but I am strong They sold me the world, but they were wrong And now that I'm back, I still belong 'Cause I know"
Others,That I am just a pony I make mistakes from time to time But now I know the real me And put my heart out on the line
Others,And let the magic in my heart stay true Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa And let the magic in my heart stay true Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa Just like the magic inside of you
Others,Just like the magic inside of you...
Coloratura,"[amplified] Thank you, everypony! When I arrived at the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I had forgotten who I really was! But then an old friend reminded me what real friendship is about, and she told me that if I was true to myself, I couldn't go wrong! So I have a very special surprise for her. Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, come on up!"
Coloratura and Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Equestria, the land I love A land of harmony Our flag does wave from high above For ponykind to see"
Others,"Equestria, a land of friends Where ponykind do roam They say true friendship never ends Equestria, my home"
Twilight Sparkle,"If somepony had told me when I was a blank flank that one day I'd give a speech to a class at Celestia's School of Magic, I wouldn't have believed it, but..."
Twilight Sparkle,"I hope that I have been up to the task, because I can tell that all of you are and that the future of Equestrian magic is in good hooves."
Twilight Sparkle,"Eh, I don't know, Spike. I'd like to be able to get through the whole speech without looking at the cards."
Spike,"Come on, Twilight! You can't be nervous about giving a speech to a bunch of magic students!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I'm not nervous, Spike, but I do have to set a good example, especially for magic students. That's why this speech has to be..."
Spike,[sighs] Perfect?
Twilight Sparkle,"Exactly. Let's go through it one more time. [clears throat] When Princess Celestia asked me to speak to you today, I was honored to have the opportunity to talk about my favorite subject: magic."
Twilight Sparkle,"Obviously, the long term effects of..."
Audience Pony,Shhhh.
Twilight Sparkle,"...the simultaneous acquisition of cutie marks has yet to be determined, but... [sips water] Ahem. Next slide, please."
Spike,[snoring] Huh? Huh!
Twilight Sparkle,"I can speak from my own experience that the power of Cutie Mark Magic is very real, and in the instance of my friends and I, it can be traced to a single event! Without Rainbow Dash's race to defend Fluttershy's honor, this rainboom wouldn't have happened. Fluttershy might never have discovered her love of animals. Applejack might never have realized that she belonged on her farm. And Pinkie Pie might never have decided to leave hers. It might be hard to imagine Rarity without her sense of fabulousness. But it's even harder to fathom what my life would be like. Without this rainboom, I might not have gotten into magic school. Celestia wouldn't have taken me on as her pupil or sent me to Ponyville to meet my friends. And the most powerful thing about Cutie Mark Magic that I found is the connection I share with them."
Twilight Sparkle,"But, um..."
Twilight Sparkle,The real question about... Cutie Mark Magic is... who it seems to affect.
Spike,Starlight Glimmer?
Twilight Sparkle,"I was sure I saw her, Spike. But when I looked again, she was gone! I'm just worried what she could be up to."
Spike,"Nothing good, I bet. I heard she wasn't very happy the last time you saw her."
Twilight Sparkle,Forcing everypony in her village to have the same cutie mark wasn't right. We had to do something!
Spike,"And now she's coming back for revenge. Uh, or she was just really interested in your speech!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Honestly, Spike. I'm not really sure what I saw. But as long as I have my friends, I know everything will be all right."
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe I was just more stressed about that speech than I thought.
Spike,Yeah. That sounds better than Starlight Glimmer coming back with an evil plot for revenge.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, when you say it like that, it does sound kinda silly."
Spike,Or it's totally true!
Starlight Glimmer,"Welcome home, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,"What are you doing, Starlight?"
Spike,Where'd she go?
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know, Spike, but I think we better find out!"
Spike,I guess we could start with this.
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, no! Don't touch that!"
Spike,[continued screaming] Cloudsdale? Starlight doesn't even have wings! Why would she come here?
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know, Spike, but it looked like she could fly with just magic! Keep your eyes open. We don't know what she has planned."
Spike,Isn't that Rainbow Dash?
Twilight Sparkle,Did Rainbow Dash look really young to you? And I didn't see a cutie mark. You don't think...
Spike,...We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash raced the bullies who made fun of Fluttershy and performed her first sonic rainboom?
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, only Star Swirl the Bearded could do something like that, and even his spell just went back a week! How could Starlight do more than the greatest wizard in Equestria?"
Spike,With this.
Twilight Sparkle,"Star Swirl's spell! Oh, no!"
Spike,"Come on, let's go!"
Twilight Sparkle,Go where?
Spike,To watch the race. I don't wanna miss the rainboom! Whoa!
Young Rainbow Dash,Whoa!
Young Hoops,"Heh. Later, Rainbow Crash!"
Young Rainbow Dash,Hey!
Starlight Glimmer,"Aw, sorry about this."
Young Rainbow Dash,Hey! What gives?
Twilight Sparkle,What did you do?!
Starlight Glimmer,You are about to find out.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh... I don't know what Starlight's up to yet, but we'd better figure it out before it's too late."
Spike,"Um, Twilight? I think it already is."
Spike,"Uh, Twilight? Where's your castle?"
Twilight Sparkle,"The map pulled us back, but whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here!"
Spike,But why? And how did we get here? Where's here?
Twilight Sparkle,More like when.
Spike,What do you mean?
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight altered Star Swirl's spell, then somehow used it on the map to travel into the past and change something! Once she did, the map pulled us back to the present!"
Spike,"So we're back where<U+0097> I mean, when we started?"
Twilight Sparkle,Not exactly. Everything's different. Look. The map doesn't even make sense anymore! The Crystal Empire takes up half of Equestria!
Spike,Plus there's the whole missing castle thing.
Twilight Sparkle,Right! This is too big to handle on our own.
Spike,You think?
Twilight Sparkle,We need to find our friends and get help!
Spike,"I'm gettin' a bad feeling about this, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"I know, Spike, but this is Ponyville. How bad could things be?"
Spike,Is that Sugarcube Corner?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't understand.
Spike,[gasps] [panting] Rarity?
Spike,[grunts] Rarity?!
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't think she's here, Spike. I'm not sure anything we know is the same. But I know one place that could never change!"
Twilight Sparkle,Applejack?!
Applejack,What can I do for you?
Twilight Sparkle,"It's so good to see you! We couldn't find Pinkie or Rarity or Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash, but I just knew you'd still be here!"
Applejack,Of course I am. This is my home. But who in tarnation is Pinkie Bow and Flutterdash? Or you for that matter?
Twilight Sparkle,You... don't know who I am?
Applejack,"Nope. Honestly, the only name I recognize is Rarity, but she left for Manehattan years ago."
Spike,"Probably to become a world-famous fashion designer, I bet."
Applejack,"Not that I know of. Last I heard, she went to help with the cause like everypony else."
Twilight Sparkle,The cause?
Applejack,The war against King Sombra and the Crystal Empire?
Twilight Sparkle and Spike,What?!
Applejack,Where have you two been?
Spike,"Actually, it's when."
Twilight Sparkle,"I know this is hard to believe, but you and I and those other ponies I mentioned are friends!"
Applejack,Did you bump your head on a crate of cider or somethin'?
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm telling you the truth! And if you come with me, I'll prove it."
Applejack,"Well, I'll admit. I've lived in these parts my whole life and I've never seen this before."
Spike,There's also supposed to be a castle that goes with it.
Applejack,But I still don't see what this has to do with you and I bein' friends.
Twilight Sparkle,"Another pony named Starlight Glimmer used this map to travel through time and change things in the past. For some reason, the map's here but everything else is different!"
Applejack,Different how?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, for one thing, where we came from, there's no war with King Sombra. Maybe you could tell us how the war started, then we can figure out when everything changed!"
Applejack,"That's easy enough. [sighs] When the Crystal Empire returned, it brought King Sombra back with it."
Applejack,[voiceover] And it didn't take long for him to force every one of his subjects to fight for him against Equestria.
Applejack,"[voiceover] And even with Princess Celestia leadin' the charge, it still takes every last pony in Equestria doin' their part, workin' day and night, to keep up the fight."
Twilight Sparkle,I just can't believe it! We stopped King Sombra! You and me and all of our friends!
Applejack,But we aren't friends. At least not here.
Twilight Sparkle,Right.
Applejack,"Look. I hope all this helped, but I really need to get back to cannin' those apples."
Twilight Sparkle,Thank you. We're going to set things right.
Applejack,[sighs] I hope you do.
Spike,So... how are we gonna set things right?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know! The only thing we know for sure is that Starlight stopped the rainboom.
Spike,And that the map's still here.
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Spike, that's it! The map is connected to the Tree of Harmony! It must sense that something isn't right! That's why it's still here! I'll just use Starlight's version of the spell and go back a little earlier and stop her before she even knows we're there!"
Twilight Sparkle,All we have to do now is find Starlight and<U+0097>
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, finding her will be easy! But stopping her's gonna be harder than you think. Sorry to disappoint you, but I created that spell to send myself back in time. So even when you cast it, I still get sent back here. It wasn't difficult to change Star Swirl's spell. He'd already done the hard part. But figuring out I could use the map to go to any time or place and pull you along with me? [short laugh] I even impressed myself with that. I knew you'd try to stop me. You're so predictable. Why else would I leave the scroll behind? Touching it triggered the map to whisk you here and watch me erase the one thing that linked you with your friends! My village was a sanctuary of equality, where nopony's cutie mark allowed them to feel superior! It was a special place, and you and your friends took it away!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Now it's my turn to take something special from you! Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bonds! Cutie marks for cutie marks! Sounds like a fair trade to me!"
Spike,Twiliiiiiiight!
Twilight Sparkle,Oops!
Spike,[screaming] Thanks!
Twilight Sparkle,"No problem, Spike. At least now we know exactly what we have to do!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, keep your eyes peeled."
Spike,Right!
Twilight Sparkle,We have to stop Starlight as soon as Rainbow Dash and those bullies race by!
Spike,"Um, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,So be ready.
Spike,"I know, but<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,Because she could pop up anywhere!
Spike,Like over there?
Starlight Glimmer,Just remember how you'd feel if someone said those things to you.
Twilight Sparkle,What's going on here?
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, I was just reminding these two colts how hurtful teasing can be."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, don't!"
Others,"Young ""Dumb-Bell"" Huh?"
Young Fluttershy,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,I mean... you were?
Starlight Glimmer,"Of course! In a world where everypony is unique, some are bound to feel more special than others. But that isn't a license to be cruel, is it?"
Twilight Sparkle,"No, of course not..."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, isn't it a shame we don't live in a world where everypony is equal? No one would ever tease anyone there! Wouldn't that be nice?"
Others,"Young ""Dumb-Bell"", Mm-hmm."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, it wouldn't! I mean, it'd be nice not to be teased, of course, but that's not the same thing!"
Young Hoops,"Come on, Fluttershy. Maybe I can help you get through the course this time."
Young Fluttershy,"Well, I-I sure could use the practice..."
Twilight Sparkle,I know you only convinced those bullies to not tease Fluttershy to stop the rainboom!
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, that's not true. I convinced them not to be bullies because everypony should be equal. Stopping the rainboom is just a bonus."
Spike,Look!
Twilight Sparkle,This isn't over yet!
Starlight Glimmer,If you say so!
Twilight Sparkle,Hi!
Young Rainbow Dash,Um... hi?
Twilight Sparkle,You think you can stop for a minute?
Young Rainbow Dash,Sure.
Twilight Sparkle,I hear you're pretty fast!
Young Rainbow Dash,Pretty fast? Please! I'm even faster than that!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, so, um, hey, you want to race?"
Young Rainbow Dash,"Um, that wouldn't really be fair. I mean, you're a full-grown pony, and... Wait. Are you an Alicorn?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, I thought you were fast!"
Young Rainbow Dash,"Uh, actually, I just remembered I have somewhere I need to be."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, listen. You don't have to race me. I just need you to fly fast enough for a sonic rainboom!"
Young Rainbow Dash,What?! I can't do that! Nopony can! It's not even a real thing! It's just an old mare's tale!
Twilight Sparkle,But it's not! I know it's not! I've seen you do it! In the future!
Young Rainbow Dash,Ooookay... I'm gonna go now.
Twilight Sparkle,No! Wait!
Starlight Glimmer,"Gee, Twilight, what's the matter? Couldn't convince her to do the impossible? That's too bad."
Spike,"Ugh. Well, that didn't work."
Twilight Sparkle,This is gonna be harder than I thought. We'll have to try again!
Spike,"Hey, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't want to live in that awful future we saw!
Spike,I don't think you'll have to!
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie? Fluttershy?
Pinkie Pie,"Silence, changeling!"
Fluttershy,All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be... destroyed!
Spike,Starlight Glimmer?
Twilight Sparkle,"I was sure I saw her, Spike!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Welcome home, Twilight!"
Spike,We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash performed her first sonic rainboom?
Starlight Glimmer,"Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bond!"
Twilight Sparkle,But whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here!
Twilight Sparkle,I don't want to live in that awful future we saw!
Spike,I don't think you'll have to.
Fluttershy,All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be... destroyed!
Twilight Sparkle,Wait! We're not changelings! I'm a pony! And he's a dragon!
Pinkie Pie,A likely story! Do something dragonish!
Pinkie Pie,[wheezes] That works!
Fluttershy,The servants of Chrysalis will do anything to save their evil skins!
Zecora,Stop! If they are changelings we'll soon see. Though I think they're not what they appear to be.
Twilight Sparkle,"Zecora! Please, you have to listen."
Zecora,"Beneath this salve, no changeling hides, for it reveals the truth inside."
Pinkie Pie,What does it mean?
Zecora,"The meaning is far worse, I see, for it is we who should not be."
Twilight Sparkle,I think I can explain.
Zecora,"I'm sure you can, but let's not talk here. Chrysalis and her army will soon draw near!"
Zecora,The changelings took over not long ago. Though I'll wager in your world that isn't so.
Twilight Sparkle,"Chrysalis and her army tried to take over Canterlot, but my friends and I stopped her."
Zecora,"Those friends as you know them are not here, alas. But tell me how all this came to pass."
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight Glimmer, a pony who traveled back in time to stop my friends and me from ever coming together!"
Zecora,And it is these friends you have in life that keep Equestria free from strife?
Twilight Sparkle,"I guess so. But this is the second time I've come back and this world is even worse than the last one! If Starlight keeps doing the same thing in the past, how could the present be so different?"
Zecora,"Ah. Time is a river, where even the tiniest changes seen can lead to a cascade of effects downstream."
Zecora,"This part of the forest is dark and damp, but it's done well to hide our camp."
Spike,This is cozy.
Rarity,[shrieks] Please! You have to help us!
Rainbow Dash,The changelings attacked Ponyville! We barely escaped with our lives!
Zecora,The only changeling attack I see is the one that come here looking for me!
Queen Chrysalis,"[laughs] What a lovely village you've chosen to stage your little resistance. It looks absolutely delicious! [slurping] Oh, come now, Zecora. You're vastly outnumbered."
Queen Chrysalis,I know you don't want your charges hurt. Come quietly to the dungeons of Canterlot and I promise to leave the others alone.
Fluttershy,Why would she ever trust you?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Even if there's a chance Chrysalis will honor her word, shouldn't you try?"
Zecora,[hushed] Race to the map while we hold off their attack. Stop Starlight and put the whole world back on track!
Queen Chrysalis,"Time to make a decision, Zecora!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Not bad, but it's gonna take a lot more than that!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Lucky for you, there's more where that came from!"
Starlight Glimmer,You've really gotta work on your aim.
Twilight Sparkle,What are you doing? You have to finish your race!
Young Rainbow Dash,No way! This is way more exciting!
Starlight Glimmer,See? You can't stop me no matter what you do.
Young Rainbow Dash,"Aw, man."
Spike,That's strange.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, you obviously don't mean us falling, because that's becoming pretty routine."
Spike,"No, it's just the other times we've come back, it's been day! But look!"
Twilight Sparkle,Why would the map bring us back to a different time of day than when we left?
Spike,"Um, maybe we should figure it out later!"
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] The Castle of the Two Sisters!
Spike,"Well, don't just stand here!"
Spike,This place looks a lot cleaner than I remember.
Twilight Sparkle,Rarity?
Rarity,The castle isn't open for viewings today. The tapestries all need changing. Again.
Spike,"Rarity, it's me!"
Rarity,I don't socialize with dragons. I don't know anypony who would.
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, you have to listen to me! The future of Equestria's at stake!"
Rarity,"I don't know how you know my name, but I am far too busy to entertain some tourist's ridiculous fantasies."
Twilight Sparkle,"I have to get back to the map so I can stop Starlight from changing the past, because every present I come to is worse than the last!"
Nightmare Moon,"Time travel, you say? Now that's something I would like to see."
Nightmare Moon,[laughing] Tell me how you came by this magic to travel through time.
Rainbow Dash,"The princess asked you a question! And unless you wanna end up in the dungeon, you'll tell her what she wants to know!"
Nightmare Moon,Nopony in my kingdom but me should possess a magic powerful enough to change time.
Spike,Your kingdom?
Nightmare Moon,Who else?
Spike,"Um... Celestia, of course!"
Nightmare Moon,"[laughing] My sister has been imprisoned in the moon for years! But it is no less a fate than she'd sentence me to! Now, reveal to me the source of this time magic!"
Twilight Sparkle,...Alright.
Spike,"Twilight, no!"
Twilight Sparkle,"We have no choice, Spike. [to Nightmare Moon] I can take you to it, but you'll have to get past the timberwolves."
Nightmare Moon,I am the ruler of all of Equestria. Do you think I can't deal with timberwolves?
Twilight Sparkle,No. I know you can.
Nightmare Moon,And if you were thinking of trying to escape...
Nightmare Moon,...it would be very unfortunate for your friend.
Nightmare Moon,How does it work?
Twilight Sparkle,A pony from my time used this spell to travel back and change the past.
Nightmare Moon,"And now you will give this spell to me! With it, I will ensure that the Elements of Harmony are never found and my reign lasts forever!"
Twilight Sparkle,But it won't.
Nightmare Moon,What?!
Twilight Sparkle,"In my world, my friends and I found the Elements and used them to defeat you! And I will do everything in my power to bring that world back!"
Nightmare Moon,No!
Nightmare Moon,Noooooo!
Twilight Sparkle,Now more than ever I know how important it is to stop you!
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, good luck!"
Young Rainbow Dash,Whoooaaaa!
Starlight Glimmer,"Up for another race-ending fight, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,No. You were right. I can't stop you.
Twilight Sparkle,"But you can't stop me from trying, and we could be stuck doing this for all eternity!"
Starlight Glimmer,"If that's what it takes to keep you and your friends from getting your cutie mark connection, then I'm game!"
Twilight Sparkle,What you're doing goes way beyond cutie marks! Everything we do here in the past <U+0096> even the smallest change <U+0096> can snowball into an avalanche of trouble for the future!
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, next I suppose you'll tell me that ""the fate of all of Equestria hangs in the balance""!"
Twilight Sparkle,It does!
Starlight Glimmer,"Spare me your overblown ego! No group of friends, not even Princess Twilight's, is that important!"
Young Rainbow Dash,Aaaaaaah!
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know how important other ponies' friendships are to the future, but I can show you what the world is like without mine!"
Starlight Glimmer,Where are we?!
Twilight Sparkle,"The future. Or rather, the present."
Starlight Glimmer,But there's nothing here!
Twilight Sparkle,"I wish I could say I was surprised. But every world I come back to is worse than the last. I don't know why my friends and I are so important to Equestria, but we are."
Starlight Glimmer,I don't believe you!
Spike,"Come on, Starlight, look around!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Like I said, everything in the past affects the future, even the tiniest act. And what you're doing leads here. I know I can't stop you, but I thought showing you this might change your mind."
Starlight Glimmer,Change my mind? You don't know anything about me! I was perfectly happy before you and your friends ruined what I built!
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know what happened that led you to make your village without cutie marks, and I'm sorry my friends and I had to take it away."
Starlight Glimmer,You want to know what happened to me?! I'll show you!
Twilight Sparkle,Where are we?
Starlight Glimmer,"That map of yours is connected to every part of Equestria, and this part is my home."
Starlight Glimmer,"Sunburst and I did everything together. In fact, I don't remember us ever being apart. Until today."
Starlight Glimmer,"And just like that, my friend was gone. His family recognized his magical talent and sent him off to Canterlot. I never saw him again."
Spike,"Well, why not?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Because of his cutie mark! He got his, and I didn't! He moved on, and I didn't! I stayed here and never made another friend because I was too afraid another cutie mark would take them away, too!"
Twilight Sparkle,That's ridiculous. A cutie mark can't take your friends away.
Starlight Glimmer,Not everypony's lucky enough to get her cutie mark at the same time as her friends!
Starlight Glimmer,"You don't know what it's like to lose a friend because of a cutie mark. But once I stop the rainboom, you will!"
Starlight Glimmer,"And when I destroy this scroll, there'll be no way for you to change it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, you're right! I don't know what you went through! But I do know you can't do this! I've seen where this leads, and so have you!"
Starlight Glimmer,I only saw what you showed me! Who knows what'll really happen?
Twilight Sparkle,I've seen it a dozen times! Things don't turn out well in Equestria without my friends!
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh! What's so special about your friends?! How can a group of ponies that are so different be so important?!
Twilight Sparkle,The differences between me and my friends are the very things that make our friendship strong!
Starlight Glimmer,"I thought Sunburst and I were the same. But we turned out different, and it tore our friendship apart!"
Twilight Sparkle,"So try again! Make new friends! And if something that you can't control happens that changes things, work through it together! That's what friendship is! And it's not just my friendships that are important to Equestria! Everypony's are! When yours ended, it led us here. But just imagine all the others that are out there waiting for you if you just give them a chance!"
Starlight Glimmer,How do I know they won't all end the same way?
Twilight Sparkle,I guess it's up to you to make sure they don't.
Spike,[kissing] One Castle of Friendship <U+0096> check!
Rarity,What in Equestria was that?!
Fluttershy,Is everypony okay?
Pinkie Pie,[squeals] Can you do it again?
Spike,One group of amazing friends <U+0096> check!
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, Spike. It looks like we're home!"
Applejack,Uh... what's she doin' here?
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, it's kind of a long story."
Rainbow Dash,"I mean, I knew my rainboom was awesome, but I never thought all of Equestria depended on it!"
Pinkie Pie,Or on us!
Twilight Sparkle,"I think it's more than that. Friendship connects all of Equestria, and undoing one group of friends made its magic less powerful."
Applejack,I can't believe y'all were able to travel through time like that.
Pinkie Pie,That Starlight must be pretty magical!
Twilight Sparkle,"She obviously has more talent for magic than almost anypony I've seen. My magic couldn't stop her. I had to convince her to stop on her own. Once I realized that, everything fell into place."
Applejack,"But if she's as powerful as all that, we can't just send her on her way, can we?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, I kind of have something else in mind."
Starlight Glimmer,"[gulps, exhales] I know there's no excuse for what I did, but I want you all to know that I'm ready for whatever punishment you think is fair."
Twilight Sparkle,"I've been thinking a lot about how badly Equestria fared without just one group of friends. Because even when one friendship dies, the results can be disastrous."
Starlight Glimmer,I know first-hoof how true that can be.
Twilight Sparkle,"And that's why I've asked you here. If you're willing to learn, I'm willing to teach you what I know. You'll have the power to make Equestria an even better place."
Starlight Glimmer,[hushed] How do I start?
Twilight Sparkle,Starting is easy! All you have to do is make a friend! And you've got seven of them right here.
Starlight Glimmer,I never thought that I would find a place To step right in and start again I never thought that I could just begin Right where I left off and make a friend
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't ever think that it might be too late You don't have to wait, there's no mistakes with the friends you make A friendship's only made of what you bring And if you do it right, you can do anything"
Starlight Glimmer and Mane Six,"Just use your eyes This time, no lies Just don't disguise Who you are inside"
Others,"Because your friends are always there for you You don't have to be the same for friendship to be true Because your friends are always there for you Around the world, it's still the same Together you have more to gain There's nothing that a friend won't do"
Others,"Everywhere you go Friendship there will grow When you find it, it's the key Friends can change the world, you see"
Others,"Everywhere you go Friendship there will grow When you find it, it's the key Friends can change the world (ah-ah) Friends can change the world (ah-ah) Friends can change the world, you see"
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] Okay. Library... Library... Where did they put the library?
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] This castle looked a lot smaller from the outside.
Spike,"[muffled] Morning, Starlight!"
Starlight Glimmer,Whoops!
Starlight Glimmer,"Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still trying to find my way around. You don't happen to know where the library is, do you?"
Spike,[muffled] Next door on the left!
Starlight Glimmer,Oh. Thanks!
Twilight Sparkle,"Acceptance, mm-hmm. Altruism, definitely. Starlight, good morning, come in!"
Starlight Glimmer,Sorry I'm late. I got a little turned around. I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil... after everything I did.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'm not one to dwell on the past, and neither should you. The castle is your home now, and as far as being my pupil goes, I was just trying to figure out what your first friendship lesson should be!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, well, it looks like you're really narrowing it down!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, these are just the A's. After this, I move on to the B's!"
Starlight Glimmer,"I know I'm just learning about friendship, but I didn't think there were this many lessons for anything. How do we choose?"
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe I should pare things down a bit before we go through them. Why don't you join the others in the throne room? They're planning our trip to the Crystal Empire when Shining Armor and Princess Cadance have their baby!
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I think we should leave ASAP. I don't want to miss the Crystalling!"
Fluttershy,"But, um, shouldn't we wait for the invitation?"
Applejack,"Frankly, I'm not exactly clear on all the customs and traditions of the Crystal Empire, especially when it comes to a Crystalling."
Starlight Glimmer,What's a Crystalling?
Rarity,"Well, that's just it, darling. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's baby is due any day, and we're still not sure. The Crystal Empire was gone for a thousand years. A lot of their customs are a bit murky."
Applejack,We know it's got somethin' to do with the new baby.
Pinkie Pie,[quickly] And a party!
Fluttershy,And the Crystal Heart.
Pinkie Pie,[quickly] And a party!
Rainbow Dash,And some kinda cool energy.
Pinkie Pie,And... a party!
Spike,"It's not hard to understand. Most things in the Crystal Empire aren't. Like how I'm a big hero there, for example!"
Spike,"Eh... plus, I've had to help Twilight do a lot of research on Crystallings. Whenever a baby is born in the Crystal Empire, the parents bring it before the Crystal Heart. They get the purest shard of crystal they can find, then pick a crystaller to present the baby to everypony who comes. Then they all share the light and joy they feel, feeding it into the crystal that joins with the Heart, and increases its power! And this is going to be a royal Crystalling, so pretty much the whole empire will show up. That hasn't happened in a millennia!"
Starlight Glimmer,What do you mean it increases the Crystal Heart's power?
Spike,"The energy it uses to protect the Crystal Empire, I guess."
Starlight Glimmer,Protect it from what?
Spike,I... didn't help Twilight with that part.
Starlight Glimmer,"Hey, Twilight, can I ask you something about the Crystal Empire?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Huh! Funny you should mention it. Because I just narrowed your first friendship lesson down to three options, and one of them is in the Crystal Empire!"
Starlight Glimmer,Really?
Twilight Sparkle,I found out that's where the first pony you ever cared about lives!
Starlight Glimmer,Sunburst?
Twilight Sparkle,"Of course, that's just one idea. We could also go to Griffonstone. [begins fading out] Making friends with a griffon is a challenge all by itself! Or we could tag along with the CMC's the next time they try to help a pony figure out why they're special..."
Twilight Sparkle,[normal] Starlight? Is something wrong?
Starlight Glimmer,"What? O-Oh, no, heh, those all sound great!"
Twilight Sparkle,I know! I guess you were right <U+0096> it is gonna be hard to choose one!
Starlight Glimmer,[laughs nervously] ...Yeah.
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh! I am never gonna find my way around this place!
Spike,"Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?"
Starlight Glimmer,"I don't know, Spike. Twilight's figuring out what my first friendship lesson is, and I guess I'm not exactly thrilled with the options. Well... with one of them."
Spike,Which one?
Starlight Glimmer,Reuniting me with my first friend.
Spike,What's so terrible about that?
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] [narrating] When we were foals, Sunburst knew everything there was to know about magic. He always knew just what to do. And he was always there to help me. I guess it's not surprising that Sunburst got his cutie mark in magic and... went off to Princess Celestia's school. But when he left..."
Spike,"You blamed cutie marks and stripped a whole village of theirs, and when Twilight and the others stopped you, you went back in time and almost destroyed Equestria."
Starlight Glimmer,"Not really stuff I'm super eager to tell Sunburst about. I mean, he's probably some big important wizard now, and... I can't even find my way around Twilight's castle."
Spike,"Well, if Sunburst is that good at magic, maybe he'd appreciate your, uh... [clears throat] exploits. You should talk to Twilight about it. I'm sure she'd want to hear what you have to say."
Starlight Glimmer,I know. But I don't want her to think I'm not ready to learn or that I'm not grateful for everything she's doing.
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Come quick!
Spike,It's a Crystalling invitation!
Twilight Sparkle,"Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt! Well, this settles it! Since we're going to the Crystal Empire, your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst!"
Starlight Glimmer,Great...
Rainbow Dash,"[yawn] Um, Applejack, what is that?"
Applejack,"Oh, just a little somethin' for the young'un. Made from genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple trees. We make 'em for all the Apples, and anypony related to Twilight is practically family."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, it's okay... But it's no Cloudsdale mobile! Bam!"
Pinkie Pie and Rarity,Ooh!
Pinkie Pie,Pretty!
Applejack,"Well, a mobile is real nice... as long as you have somethin' to lay in so you can look at it."
Rarity,And a fetching blanket to keep you warm.
Twilight Sparkle,I'm sure Shining Armor and Princess Cadance will love all our gifts. But I think they're more happy we'll be attending the baby's Crystalling.
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! I can't wait to see all that light and love make the Crystal Heart even more sparkly and shiny!
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, Pinkie, the Crystal Heart is an ancient and powerful relic. Without its magic, the Crystal Empire would be lost to the Frozen North."
Starlight Glimmer,"Wow, this Crystalling sounds pretty important. I'd understand if you wanted to... you know... wait to do a different friendship lesson when we get back."
Twilight Sparkle,"Are you kidding? This trip is perfect! Not only do I get to see the baby and take part in the ceremony that helps maintain the magic of the Crystal Empire, but I'm starting my new pupil off with the most amazing friendship lesson ever! I can't wait!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Right... Me neither... [beat] Actually, Twilight, I am a little worried about meeting Sunburst."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, trust me. I know what it's like to see old friends. But I'll be right there to help things along. I've broken the whole lesson down into a few easy steps to ensure this reunion goes off without a hitch!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] Step one, head to Sunburst's house and get you two started on the right hoof. Step two, get to the castle with enough time to visit the ba<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Shining Armor!
Shining Armor,[tired] Twilight...!
Twilight Sparkle,I didn't know you were meeting us!
Shining Armor,"[tired] Of course I am! It's me, right here. Here I am. Why wouldn't I come meet my sister? Though we have met before, heh-heh..."
Twilight Sparkle,Are you all right?
Shining Armor,"[tired] Never better! Being a father is amazing! And wonderful, and amazing, and confusing, and amazing, but surprising too, you know? I mean, not that you'd know. You wouldn't know, I know... You know? [beat] Sorry. I haven't really slept since Cadance had the baby. Come to think of it, she hasn't either. It sure would be great to get a break."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, of course! I don't know what I was thinking! You two probably need all kinds of help! I'm sorry, Starlight, but I guess combining your first lesson with this visit wasn't such a good idea."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, uh, don't be ridiculous! You're an aunt now! That's way more important than some friendship lesson."
Twilight Sparkle,I just wish there was a way to do both.
Spike,Maybe there is! You've already done the work for Starlight's lesson with this list. All we have to do is follow it!
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, you're a genius!"
Starlight Glimmer,[through nervous laugh] Yeah... [through gritted teeth] genius.
Twilight Sparkle,"Then it's settled! Shining Armor and I will head straight to the castle, and you two can head straight to Sunburst's!"
Spike,"Aye-aye, Princess!"
Starlight Glimmer,[nervously] Uh-huh.
Twilight Sparkle,"Alright, big brother, let's go see this amazing baby pony!"
Shining Armor,[snoring] Ahhh... the baby...
Spike,"I know you're a little worried about this reunion, but I'm sure Twilight's got everything covered."
Starlight Glimmer,Everything except how I'd rather do absolutely anything else.
Spike,"Oh, I bet she's taken that into account too. It's all part of the lesson. Trust the lesson."
Starlight Glimmer,"Right... [beat] Hey, i-is that... you?"
Spike,"Oh, yep, it sure is! Now, according to the list, Sunburst's house is<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,Why is there a statue of you in the Crystal Empire?
Others,"""Scarlet Heart"": Because Spike the Brave and Glorious saved all of us from King Sombra!"
Others,"""Amber Laurel"": And then again during the Equestria Games!"
Starlight Glimmer,Really?
Others,"""Golden V<e4>s"": Really! [to Spike] Big fan."
Starlight Glimmer,"Um, when were you going to tell me about this?"
Spike,"Nah, it's no big deal."
Crystal Ponies,It most certainly is!
Starlight Glimmer,That's it! We're not going anywhere until I get the whole story!
Shining Armor,"Before we go in, I should probably tell you. Seeing the baby might be a bit of a shock."
Twilight Sparkle,"Of course, I could be wrong."
Twilight Sparkle,The baby is an Alicorn?!
Princess Cadance,[tired] It looks that way.
Rarity,"But... But... But I thought Alicorn wings had to be earned by accomplishing some great, princess-worthy deed!"
Applejack,Yeah. How can you just be born with 'em?
Princess Celestia,The birth of an Alicorn is something Equestria has never seen!
Princess Luna,It is beyond even our understanding.
Fluttershy,[hushed] That's not very reassuring.
Pinkie Pie,"Wow! A unicorn, and a Pegasus! So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic!"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I know all about super-strong flying!"
Twilight Sparkle,And I can help keep tabs on her magic!
Princess Celestia,It appears her magic is more powerful than that of a newborn unicorn!
Princess Luna,The crowds have already started to gather.
Pinkie Pie,[inhales] [blows balloon] This Crystalling is gonna be some party!
Princess Cadance,Do you think we should call it off?
Rainbow Dash,"Um, we've all faced a lot worse than baby magic."
Rarity,I can't imagine cancelling such a beautiful and important ceremony over something so potentially adorable!
Princess Celestia,"In light of the little one's abilities, this Crystalling might be more important than ever. [to Cadance] Perhaps you should address your subjects and remind them of that."
Twilight Sparkle,Shining Armor! Do you have everything you need for the ceremony?
Shining Armor,"[tired] Huh? Oh, no! I still have to interview the honor guards, choose the purity crystal, and pick a crystaller!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Alright, take it easy. Pinkie can stay here with me and keep an eye on the baby."
Applejack,And we'll all help you with everythin' else.
Shining Armor,[snores] ...baby...
Rarity,"That is, if you can stay awake long enough to tell us how."
Spike,"...and that's how we found the Crystal Heart, defeated King Sombra, and saved the Empire."
Others,"""Cloudy Spinel"": We love you, Spike!"
Others,"""Coral Shores"": Yeah. Tell the one about the Equestria Games!"
Spike,"Well, as much as I love reliving my heroic deeds, Starlight and I have an important lesson to do, by order of the Princess of Friendship!"
Foals,Awwww!
Starlight Glimmer,"Aw, come on, Spike! I want to hear about the Games too!"
Spike,"I know you're nervous about seeing Sunburst, but it says right in step 3, to, uh, ""Deal with your fears by facing them, not by putting it off."""
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh. Let's go get this over with.
Spike,Wait!
Starlight Glimmer,Huh? What?!
Spike,Knocking on the door isn't the next thing on the list!
Starlight Glimmer,Seriously?
Spike,"I know Twilight can be a little nitpicky, but this is your first lesson as her pupil, and it's important that we do it right!"
Starlight Glimmer,Fine. What's the next thing on the list?
Spike,"[clears throat] [reading] ""Before they see each other, be sure to highlight the importance of the meeting."""
Starlight Glimmer,I'm pretty sure we can skip that.
Spike,"I don't know... I mean if we skip it, the whole lesson could go south! And then you might end up taking a giant step backwards instead of forwards! Maybe you'll never be able to learn anything about friendship at all! It's almost like your whole future depends on this moment. [beat] ""Highlight the importance of the meeting"" <U+0096> check! I can't believe you wanted to skip that!"
Starlight Glimmer,Sunburst?
Sunburst,Yes? What can I do for you?
Starlight Glimmer,"It's... It's me, Starlight. We used to be friends?"
Sunburst,"[beat] Oh, of course! S-Starlight! My goodness, it-it's been a long time! What, uh, what have you been up to?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Me? Oh! You know, some of this, some of that, different... stuff. Right now, I'm sort of Twilight Sparkle's new pupil."
Sunburst,The Princess of Friendship?
Starlight Glimmer,"Heh... yeah... that's actually kind of why I'm here. I mean, I know you're probably very busy."
Sunburst,What do you mean?
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I figured after magic school, you'd go on to do important wizard work, but..."
Sunburst,"Oh. No. Y-Yes! Uh, y-yes, that's me, yup. [nervous chuckle] Important wizard! Really busy with lots of, uh, wi-wizarding... stuff. [beat] Right. Uh, well... good to see you."
Spike,Huh. Maybe we should have skipped highlighting the importance of the meeting after all.
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I guess that's that!"
Spike,"Starlight, come on! We have to at least explain what Twilight wants!"
Princess Cadance,"[tired, amplified] Dearest citizens, I am sure you are all just as thrilled and ready for this Crystalling as myself and Shining Armor."
Shining Armor,[panicked breathing] I'm not ready!
Rainbow Dash,Take it easy! Just pick whoever looks the most like honor guard material.
Shining Armor,Right... right.
Shining Armor,I'm sorry. Fatherhood is way more stressful than I ever thought.
Fluttershy,I can only imagine.
Rarity,"Now, I know choosing the crystal of purity is a very important decision. So I have gone through the trouble of arranging them in order from incredibly pure to outrageously pure."
Fluttershy,"Um, Rarity, don't they all sort of look the same?"
Rarity,"Oh, well, to the untrained eye, perhaps. What do you think, Shining Armor?"
Shining Armor,[incoherent stammering] I don't know!
Rarity,[hushed] I hope Twilight and Pinkie are having better luck with the baby!
Pinkie Pie,Well... at least she's having... fun!
Pinkie Pie,Whee!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, hold her still!"
Pinkie Pie,I'm tryiiiiiiing!
Sunburst,So... the Princess of Friendship wants you and I to be friends again?
Starlight Glimmer,"Heh, I know. Weird, right?"
Sunburst,"Uh, I don't understand. Did something happen to you after I left for magic school?"
Starlight Glimmer,What?
Starlight Glimmer,No! I-I don't see what that has to do with anything. W-Why would you even ask that?
Starlight Glimmer,"I mean, did something happen to you after you left for magic school?"
Sunburst,"What? Um, no. L-Like you said, I'm a, [clears throat] i-important wizard."
Spike,I'm sure there's something on Twilight's list that can help here.
Shining Armor,"Okay. I chose the honor guard, picked the purity crystal, and I know exactly who I want to be our crystaller. So, all we need is..."
Princess Cadance,The baby?
Twilight Sparkle,We're here!
Pinkie Pie,She's a really strong flyer!
Applejack,I'm guessin' that's gonna make it harder to do the Crystalling.
Twilight Sparkle,"It's worse than that. Without the Heart, the Crystal Empire's about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow!"
Starlight Glimmer,I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil.
Twilight Sparkle,Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt!
Twilight Sparkle,Your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst!
Sunburst,"Uh, y-yes, that's me, yup. [nervous chuckle] Important wizard!"
Twilight Sparkle,The baby is an Alicorn?!
Pinkie Pie,So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic!
Twilight Sparkle,"Without the Heart, the Crystal Empire's about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow!"
Rarity,"So... not only can we not take part in a fabulous ancient ceremony, but we're also about to be frozen solid!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Without the Crystal Heart's magical protection, the entire city's about to become a winter wasteland!"
Applejack,But what about when King Sombra ruled the Crystal Empire and the Crystal Heart was missin'? The city wasn't covered in snow then!
Twilight Sparkle,The Heart wasn't missing. It was still in the castle. King Sombra had just hidden it.
Princess Celestia,"I'm afraid Twilight is correct, and the storm clouds are already forming."
Rainbow Dash,I can totally fly up there and bust those puppies! No problem!
Princess Celestia,"I wouldn't advise it, Rainbow Dash. Those storm clouds are not like the ones you know."
Princess Luna,"This far north, the weather has a will of its own, and now it will only grow stronger, enveloping everything in its path."
Princess Cadance,Including the Crystal Empire!
Twilight Sparkle,And us along with it!
Spike,There's gotta be somethin'...
Sunburst,"I know Princess Twilight is keen on the two of us rekindling our friendship, but... it's been so long. I don't see how anything on that list is going to help."
Starlight Glimmer,"I know, right? It's not like there's some spell that would magically compel us to pick up where we left off."
Sunburst,"Well, actually, there's several. Mistmane's Material Amity, Rockhoof's Rapport, Flash Prance's Fellow... ship... [ahem] But I-I get the feeling the princess isn't looking for a spell."
Starlight Glimmer,[chuckle] Definitely not.
Spike,"Got it! [reading] ""And if all else fails, ask them to share an embarrassing moment from their past, maybe even something they regret!"""
Sunburst,"Uh, I don't see how that would help."
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, yeah! We should just get out of your mane. It's pretty obvious this isn't going how Twilight hoped, and I'm sure you have plenty of important work to do..."
Sunburst,"What? Oh! Right, yes, heh-heh! Uh, no rest for the wizardly."
Starlight Glimmer,"Come on, Spike."
Twilight Sparkle,There must be a spell that can restore the Crystal Heart!
Princess Celestia,Perhaps.
Princess Luna,But it isn't something that either of us know.
Princess Cadance,The library here at the castle is nearly as extensive as the one in Canterlot. There's a good chance we can find something there!
Twilight Sparkle,Can you hold off the storm?
Princess Luna,"Yes, for a time, but even our magic will eventually succumb to the power of the Frozen North."
Princess Celestia,"We will do what we can, but you must hurry."
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know how long it will take to find the right spell, but you should probably tell the crowd outside to get somewhere warm!"
Princess Cadance,And try not to mention the Crystal Heart. We don't want to start a panic.
Applejack,"Yes, ma'am. C'mon, girls!"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm gonna need all of your help. The crystal library is enormous!
Shining Armor,"You can count on us, Twily!"
Shining Armor,Where'd she go?!
Princess Cadance,This way!
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, Spike, looks like my biggest fears came true. I wouldn't be surprised if Twilight decides to give up on me entirely."
Starlight Glimmer,"It's not the list, Spike. Or you. Or Twilight. I'm the one Sunburst doesn't want to be friends with."
Spike,I don't remember him saying he didn't want to be friends.
Starlight Glimmer,He didn't have to say it.
Spike,"Well, Twilight obviously thinks you're worth being friends with! And I do too!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Thanks, Spike. At least I have two friends, even if one of them has dragon breath."
Spike,"[exhales] Uh, that's not dragon breath. It's freezing!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, you're right! But I thought the Crystal Heart was supposed to keep the cold weather out."
Spike,It is... unless something's happened! Come on!
Rainbow Dash,We're just saying that it might not be the best idea to stay outside!
Others,"""Tough Nut"": I camped out all night for this spot! I'm not about to just give it up!"
Fluttershy,"Still, when you think about it, the view is just as good a little further back, like... inside your house?"
Others,"""Scouts Honor"": The Crystalling ceremony is one of our most sacred traditions! And when that foal is held before the Crystal Heart, I plan to be as close to the action as possible!"
Applejack,"Honestly, I don't know if there's gonna be a Crystallin'. The truth is, the baby's an Alicorn and her magic's plum crazy, so you might not wanna be that close after all."
Others,"""Tough Nut"": A baby Alicorn? Wow, I can't wait to see that!"
Others,"""Scouts Honor"": Oh, those little wings are probably so cute!"
Others,"""Mustafa Combe"": I know, right?"
Rainbow Dash,"Look, I am a hundred percent sure the Crystalling isn't happening."
Others,"""Mustafa Combe"": No Crystalling, huh? Then why are they starting the fireworks show?"
Shining Armor,Young filly... come back here!
Pinkie Pie,Come to your Auntie Pinkie Pie!
Twilight Sparkle,"Bridle Buck's Boat Chants, Hayhoof's Intonements, Mystic Maps and Mazes... [groans] Anything up there?"
Princess Cadance,Not yet! I'm not even sure how these are organized!
Princess Cadance,"Shining Armor, I thought you were taking care of the baby!"
Shining Armor,I'm trying!
Flurry Heart,Whoo!
Rarity,Gotcha!
Rarity,Oh! Or not...
Pinkie Pie,Whoa!
Starlight Glimmer,What is going on?!
Pinkie Pie,You want the long or the short version?
Starlight Glimmer,Short?
Pinkie Pie,"[quickly] The baby's an Alicorn and she accidentally destroyed the Crystal Heart, so Twilight and Cadance are looking for a spell to put it back together and save the Crystal Empire from turning into a giant wasteland of ice and snow."
Starlight Glimmer,Oh.
Princess Cadance,[gasps] What about this? Trotter's Tome of Reliquary?
Twilight Sparkle,I think this is it!
Princess Cadance,"[reading] ""Spell of Relic Reconstitution""! I can't believe we found it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"It's a good thing, too! Without this, I don't know what we'd do!"
Pinkie Pie,Oops.
Twilight Sparkle,That spell was the only thing we found in the whole library that was even close to what we needed!
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm so sorry, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,"It's not your fault, Starlight. None of us were expecting any of this."
Princess Cadance,Do you think you can remember the spell?
Twilight Sparkle,I only read it through once!
Rarity,"Well, if anypony can exactly remember something she read for the first time two minutes ago, it's you, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,I'll try. But I'm not sure how long it'll take.
Pinkie Pie,Is quickly an option?
Princess Cadance,"I'll help if I can, but we should evacuate the city just in case! You need to lead everypony to the train station before the tracks freeze over!"
Shining Armor,"We will. But between you and Twilight, I'm sure you'll remember the spell."
Twilight Sparkle,I only hope this spell is the one we need.
Starlight Glimmer,Is there anything I can do?
Twilight Sparkle,I don't think so. I'm just sorry about your lesson.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, that doesn't matter now. Sunburst and I don't have anything in common anyway. He's a big important wizard! And I'm re-learning everything I ever thought I knew."
Princess Cadance,"Sunburst? I don't recognize the name, but if he's an important wizard, you should bring him here. Maybe he'll know what to do if the spell fails."
Starlight Glimmer,[gasps] Of course!
Twilight Sparkle,"You better go with her, Spike."
Starlight Glimmer,[straining] Sunburst! Haven't you looked outside?!
Sunburst,Snow? That's... not right. The Crystal Heart<U+0097>
Starlight Glimmer,Is gone! The baby <U+0096> Shining Armor and Cadance's baby <U+0096> it's an Alicorn!
Sunburst,Really?
Starlight Glimmer,"Really! And her magic is a little berserk, and well, I guess she destroyed the Heart! But Twilight thinks she can fix it and Princess Cadance thought you could help!"
Sunburst,Me?
Starlight Glimmer,Of course! You're an important wizard in the Crystal Empire! It just makes sense!
Sunburst,"Right... right... right right right. You know, I'd like to help, I-I really would. I-I just have so much, um, important wizard work to do around here."
Spike and Starlight Glimmer,Huh?!
Applejack,You can't stay here!
Others,"""Mustafa Combe"": Did I mention this was a Royal Crystalling? When the crystaller holds the young one aloft, all of the Empire will share their joy and light, and the Crystal Heart will beat stronger than it ever has before!"
Others,"""Scouts Honor"": It really is a moving ceremony!"
Fluttershy,I really don't think it's going to happen.
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, it's freezing out here!"
Others,"""Tough Nut"": Uh, this is the Crystal Empire. We've seen snow before."
Shining Armor,Not like this! We don't have time to argue! Princess Cadance has decided to evacuate the city!
Others,"""Mustafa Combe"": But the Crystalling...!"
Shining Armor,I don't know if we'll ever have another Crystalling again! The Crystal Heart... is shattered.
Others,"""Tough Nut"": It's not safe here!"
Applejack,[groan] That's what we've been tryin' to tell you!
Starlight Glimmer,"Sunburst, I know you're busy, but did you hear what I said?"
Sunburst,"Oh, I heard you, but-but like I said, when you're an important wizard, the work just piles up."
Starlight Glimmer,Sunburst!
Sunburst,"[sighs] Look, Starlight, I want to help. I do. But I can't. I wish I could."
Starlight Glimmer,What do you mean?!
Sunburst,Fixing an ancient relic? I-I can't even come close to doing something like that!
Starlight Glimmer,But I thought you were an important wizard!
Sunburst,"Well, you were wrong, okay?! I'm not an important wizard! I'm not even a wizard at all!"
Sunburst,"I know it's hard for you to understand, but not all of us end up achieving greatness."
Starlight Glimmer,What? Why wouldn't I understand that?
Sunburst,Really? You're the prot<e9>g<e9> of the Princess of Friendship! I don't think she picks just anypony for that!
Spike,"Technically, she's more of a student than a prot<e9>g<e9>."
Sunburst,Whatever. I'm sorry I'm not the big important wizard you were expecting.
Starlight Glimmer,"Sunburst, I don't care if you're a wizard or not. I'm just surprised. You always knew so much about magic. I mean, look at all these books!"
Sunburst,"Yeah, well, reading about magic is one thing, but you don't know what it was like at magic school! To know so much and not be able to do any of it!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, you don't know what it was like to be left behind! And then getting so bitter that you steal the cutie marks from an entire village and then get defeated by Twilight and her friends, so you travel through time to get back at them, but they beat you again and teach you about friendship, but you're so terrified ponies will find out what you did that you can't make any friends!"
Sunburst,Did you really travel through time?
Spike,See? I told you he'd be impressed.
Sunburst,"I'm sorry we lost touch. Maybe if I had reached out, you could have helped me at magic school, and I could have helped you to..."
Starlight Glimmer,Not become totally evil? [sighs] Let's just say I know what it's like to have something you're not exactly proud of.
Sunburst,When you showed up thinking I was some big wizard... I'm sorry. I should have told you the truth.
Starlight Glimmer,It's fine. At least we worked it all out. I think Twilight would be proud of us.
Spike,"Well, if you ever want to tell her about it, we should probably leave now!"
Starlight Glimmer,"[gasps] I forgot to tell you! They're evacuating the city! You need to get to the train station, unless you've got a spell here that will drive back the Frozen North and fix the Crystal Heart so the baby can have her Crystalling?"
Sunburst,Crystalling...! Of course!
Princess Celestia,"Push them back, my sister!"
Shining Armor,This way!
Rainbow Dash,Ugh!
Applejack,"Just a little bit further, y'all! The station's just ahead!"
Starlight Glimmer,We have to go back!
Sunburst,I know how to stop this!
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, I think that's everything?"
Princess Cadance,"It looks right to me, but... there's only one way to find out!"
Twilight Sparkle,The spell failed. I don't know what else to do.
Princess Celestia,An old student of mine believes he does.
Sunburst,The baby did this?!
Twilight Sparkle,I tried putting it back together with<U+0097>
Sunburst,"The spell of Relic Reconstitution. No, that won't do it. The Crystal Heart's been around for millennia. Restoring a relic like this is way beyond one spell. You need to combine it with something else. Something unique to the relic itself. Something that strengthens it and provides it with power...?"
Twilight Sparkle,The Crystalling!
Sunburst,"Combining that spell with the light and love of everypony gathered for the ceremony, together with... Somnambula's Weather Abjuration to clear away the snow... and a little Fledgling's Forbearance for the parents... Heh. That should curb the little one's power fluctuations."
Princess Cadance,You must be Sunburst. Starlight said you were a powerful wizard.
Sunburst,"Oh, I'm no wizard."
Rainbow Dash,What?
Starlight Glimmer,"But he studied magic his whole life! You should see his house! And since nopony has any better ideas, what do we have to lose?!"
Shining Armor,"I had planned on asking Twilight to be our crystaller, but since it seems like she'll be busy..."
Sunburst,I'd be honored!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, what are we waiting for?!"
Sunburst,Citizens! May I present the newest member of the Crystal Empire!
Others,"""Mustafa Combe"": She's beautiful!"
Others,"""Scouts Honor"": Oh! It's just so moving!"
Others,"""Tough Nut"": Best Crystalling ever!"
Starlight Glimmer,"For a pony who isn't great at magic, you did pretty well."
Princess Celestia,"Indeed. I'm glad to see you've found a way to share your unique gift, Sunburst. You may be more of a wizard than you think."
Night Light,You would not believe the crazy weather that delayed our train. Came out of nowhere.
Twilight Velvet,"But it was all worth it to see this peaceful little angel! Awww, so sweet! Come to your grandmare!"
Applejack,"Yeah, peaceful now, anyway."
Twilight Sparkle,I suppose that spell really did the trick!
Shining Armor,We have Sunburst to thank for that.
Princess Cadance,I hope he takes his role as crystaller seriously. Something tells me the baby will need a pony like him to look to for magical advice.
Twilight Velvet,"Cadance, darling, aren't we gonna name the poor little dear, or are we gonna spend our entire visit just calling her ""the baby""?"
Princess Cadance,"We were thinking... ""Flurry Heart""."
Shining Armor,"You know, to remember the occasion."
Rarity,"Oh, goodness, how could anypony forget?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I think you're the Crystal Empire's big important wizard, whether you like it or not."
Sunburst,I don't know if I'll have time for any wizarding. I'm a crystaller now. That's a big responsibility.
Starlight Glimmer,I can't think of anypony more qualified. Just... promise you'll stay in touch?
Sunburst,"Hm, like I'd ever lose touch with my oldest friend."
Spike,"What's wrong, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know, Spike. I think I have a lot to learn about being a teacher."
Spike,What are you talking about? Your lesson went perfectly! Starlight and Sunburst got over their past and rekindled their friendship!
Twilight Sparkle,No thanks to me. I know a lot happened. I just wish I could have given my pupil the attention she deserves.
Spike,"Well, I know she needed to be put on the right path, but giving her the space to make her own decisions worked pretty well. Isn't that how Celestia taught you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, I never thought about it! But I guess it is!"
Spike,Maybe you're a better teacher than you thought.
Pinkie Pie,"[singsong] We're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan...!"
Rarity,"[nonplussed] Yes, yes, Manehattan, the height of sophistication, elegance, culture... Since my boutique in Canterlot has been doing so nicely, it only makes sense for me to open one there as well."
Pinkie Pie,[squeals] We're almost there! Why doesn't your face look like this?! Eee...
Rarity,"Oh, Pinkie, dear, this is just a business trip for me. I need to scour the city for the most perfect location for my new shop. And while it's lovely how excited you are, there's absolutely no chance of me getting swept into the<U+0096> [gasps] [suddenly excited] energy, the beauty, the majesty of the greatest city in all of Equestria!"
Rarity,"[sighs] This city's simply a-ma-zing! It's just... everything, ever!"
Pinkie Pie,And it's about to get everything ever-er! Because guess who I see! M-A-U-D! You know what that spells?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] It spells Maud.
Pinkie Pie,"Maud, Maud, Maud! Yay!"
Rarity,"Oh, you Pie sisters have just about the sweetest family traditions! Every year, you set aside a special day to spend with each of your sisters?"
Pinkie Pie,"Yep! I do separate trips with each one, and we make it super fun by picking a different location every year! We see the sights all day and then swap gifts at sunset! And since Maud's getting her rocktorate nearby, we figured this would be the perfect spot for PSSSD!"
Rarity,"[hushed] Okay, what's the secret?"
Pinkie Pie,Huh?
Rarity,You just said 'pssst'.
Pinkie Pie,"No, silly! Not pssst, PSSSD! P-S-S-S-D! Pie Sisters Surprise Swap Day!"
Rarity,Maud!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Boulder promised his cousin a postcard.
Rarity,"Well, I'll just leave you two to your PSSSD. And now, I am off to scout possible locations for my new boutique!"
Pinkie Pie,"Before you go, can I ask you a quick question?"
Rarity,"Oh, of course."
Pinkie Pie,[loudly] Will you please help me?!
Rarity,[nervously] Only if you let go of my leg and stand up...
Pinkie Pie,"Every year, Maud's PSSSD gift always blows mine away! But this year is going to be different! For the first time, I'm finally getting her a gift that's as good as the one she always gets me! There's a specialty store here in Manehattan that sells nothing but rock pouches! A rock pouch would be perfect for Boulder, and I know Maud will love it!"
Rarity,"Why, Pinkie, that really is the perfect gift for Maud!"
Pinkie Pie,"I know, right? Problem is, I still need to buy one, and the store is downtown!"
Rarity,"Hmm, and you want to get a pouch for Maud without ruining the surprise... Well, luckily for you, I know exactly what you should do! Why not sight-see on a path that leads right to the pouch store? That way Maud won't get suspicious! I'll come with you to distract Maud, so..."
Rarity,"Y-Yes, yes, yes, let's not get too excited until you actually get a pouch for Maud."
Pinkie Pie,Of course. Got it. Absolutely.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Nothing moved him.
Pinkie Pie,Maud! I'm giving you the greatest PSSSD gift in the history of ever!
Rarity,"Oh, what a spectacular view! You really can see everything from here!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Especially the glaciation of the sloping strata. It's breathtaking.
Pinkie Pie,But not half as breathtaking as the gift I'm giving you!
Rarity,I-It certainly is<U+0096> [grunts] <U+0096>cozy... but this simply won't do! Working in a space this small would make me lose my mind!
Pinkie Pie,Just like Maud's gonna lose her mind when she sees the gift I'm giving her!
Pinkie Pie,Whatever you were about to say isn't nearly as good as the gift I'm giving Maud!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You'll be pleased with yours too.
Rarity,"Pinkie, put down that crayon! The Cantering Cook isn't that kind of restaurant!"
Rarity,Oh... A pony could get used to eating at places like this!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I know. It's the only restaurant in the city with nepheline syenite in their bathroom tiles.
Rarity,"[stutters] ...Well, isn't that something! [deliberately] You know what, Pinkie Pie? Uh, maybe you could help me figure out what to order!"
Pinkie Pie,[hushed] We're so close to the pouch store! It's just a block away! I could practically smell it from here! If I knew what a pouch store smelled like.
Rarity,"[hushed] Okay, remember the plan. I will stay here and distract Maud while you go get a pouch!"
Pinkie Pie,[hushed] Gotcha!
Rarity,"[deliberately] Oh, why, thank you for the kind assistance, Pinkie Pie. And now I know exactly what to order."
Pinkie Pie,"[deliberately] You are very welcome, Rarity! Now pardon me whilst I go wash my hooves!"
Pinkie Pie,Sorry!
Rarity,"So, Maud... that Boulder of yours is such an interesting... ahem... character. You must tell me, how did the two of you first meet?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] It was a dark and stormy night. Little did I know that my life was about to change forever.
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Look at that hand-stitched ten-thousand-thread-count velvet-lined rock pouch! Maud will love it! I need it!
Pinkie Pie,"Ungh! Huh, must be stuck! [reading] ""Took a sudden vacation to Canterlot with my grandniece. Back in a few moons."" Oh, no. Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no-no! Well, maybe, just maybe, he's already back from vacation and just forgot to take the sign down! [shouting and pounding on door] Hello, Mr. Pouch Store Owner! I'd like to hear all about your sudden vacation in Canterlot with your grandniece while buying a pouch for my sister please!"
Deputy Copper,"Miss, the store's clearly closed."
Pinkie Pie,"But it can't be. It just can't be! If I can't get that pouch... then not only am I not getting my sister the greatest present in the history of PSSSD, but now I have no PSSSD present for my sister at all!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] ...and Boulder's been by my side ever since.
Rarity,"[deadpan] Wow. What a surprisingly suspenseful and compelling story. I completely get what you see in him now. [gasps] Pinkie Pie, you're back! [deliberately] Oh, your hooves must be sparkling clean!"
Rarity,"Gar<e7>on! One super-deluxe two-mile-high hot fudge sundae, stat!"
Rarity,What happened? Did you get a pouch for Maud? Tell me everything!
Rarity,"Oh, not to worry, dear! I'll just have to help you find a new present for Maud. We have plenty of time before your gift exchange at sunset and all of Manehattan to explore. We're bound to find something Maud would like. Maybe even more than a rock pouch!"
Pinkie Pie,"You're right! Thanks, Rarity!"
Rarity,"Maud, I can't help but notice you're staring at that marvelous giraffe. I was just wondering, any chance you could see yourself with it?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Only if I had a mirror.
Rarity,"Now, Maud, I know you're a big fan of rocks, so get your camera ready, because these are the most spectacular rocks in all of Manehattan! Surely there must be something here that catches your eye."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] [hushed] Boulder says they're all too... stuck-up.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I like... that.
Rarity,What is it? You have to tell me! Was it this bike? This lamp? This grappling hook? What do you like?!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I like that fissure in the sidewalk. It's an elegant example of thermal expansion and soil settlement.
Rarity,Fissure in thhhhhhhe soil...? What?! But I...! All of this...! And she likes a crack?!
Pinkie Pie,Did she like anything?
Rarity,[hushed] That sister of yours is simply impossible to shop for! There's nothing she needs or wants!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] [calling out] Boulder. Boulder. Where'd you run off to? There you are. Sure wish I had something to carry you around in.
Pinkie Pie,"A rock pouch was the perfect gift for Maud! Aw, and I know she would have loved the one I saw in the window! It had double stitching, a red drawstring..."
Rarity,...and ochre-flecked velvet lining with reinforced triple-crosshatched seams?
Pinkie Pie,"Yep, that's the pouch. [beat] Wait, how'd you know?"
Rarity,"Because I'm looking at one just like it! Maybe if you can catch up with him, you could ask<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"Excuse me, sir! I couldn't help but notice your nifty rock pouch! Is there any chance you'd be willing to part with it? I really need it. Like, really really really!"
Others,"""Street Rat"": You, uh, really really need this pouch, huh?"
Pinkie Pie,I believe I said really really really.
Others,"""Street Rat"": Well, you know, pouches like this are really hard to come by these days. But I might be able to part with it for the right price."
Pinkie Pie,"So you'll sell it to me? And I'll finally be able to give my sister the perfect Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day present? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Others,"""Street Rat"": Hmmm. That's one sweet party cannon you got there. Tell you what. I'd be more than happy to give you the pouch for the low, low price of... that cannon."
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] M-My... party cannon...?
Others,"""Street Rat"": Well, if you really wanna give that sister of yours the perfect present, then you'll have to give up your party cannon. So, what do you say? The pouch for the cannon."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Do you see the exposed chalcedony in the fissure?
Rarity,Probably?
Pinkie Pie,[despondent] What you guys lookin' at?
Rarity,"Oh, you're back! [to Maud] Darling, I want to get one more picture of you with that astounding fissure in the sidewalk, and the inspiration just struck me for the perfect shot! Uh, be a dear and go stand behind it. Okay, now just, uh, back up a little bit! Little more! And now just a little... uh... twenty yards more! Perfect! Hold that pose! I think we found your new holiday card! [hushed, to Pinkie] So, how did it go? Tell me, tell me, tell me!"
Pinkie Pie,"[despondent] Well, I got the rock pouch for Maud, and... that's really the only thing that matters."
Rarity,"Oh, I am so glad to hear that! She's going to absolutely love it!"
Pinkie Pie,[despondent] Yup.
Rarity,"""Yup""? That's it? You got your sister the greatest PSSSD present in the history of ever, and all you have to say is ""yup""?"
Pinkie Pie,[despondent] Yup.
Rarity,"But... you're Pinkie Pie. You're supposed to be all [quickly] ""Oh, I'm so excited I bought the rock pouch! And I know I say excited a lot when I'm actually just kind of excited, but this time I'm really excited about how excited I am about being this excited over the rock pouch!"" [normally] And then you fire off your party cannon. Say, where is your cannon? [gasps] Did you lose it? Is your party cannon lost somewhere in the big city?!"
Rarity,"I can clearly see that something's bothering you, and I want to help. But I can't help you unless you tell me what the problem is."
Pinkie Pie,"[despondent] Oh, there's no problem. It just turns out that the going rate for a rock pouch in Manehattan is one party cannon. Who knew?"
Rarity,"You gave away your cannon?! But, but that party cannon is your everything! You absolutely love that cannon! How could you possibly part with something that means so much to you?!"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, I finally got Maud a gift that's just as good as the ones she always gets me, and that's all that really matters."
Rarity,"Well, I guess I understand... maybe."
Pinkie Pie,Maud's going to be so excited. I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees the pouch!
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] I know, the camera loves Boulder."
Rarity,"After the day we've had, I'm probably looking forward to the swap part of the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day even more than the two of you! [giggles] And I'm not even a Pie sister! I can't wait one more second to see the wonderful gifts you've gotten each other!"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, you're going to have to. We don't just swap, silly. We always sing the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day Song first! Ready, Maud?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] As I'll ever be.
Pinkie Pie,It's the Pie Sisters' Swap Day Sooooooong!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Hey.
Rarity,[growls] Just open them already!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Thanks.
Pinkie Pie,"I knew you'd love it! It was all worth it! Look how happy she is! And I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, Rarity. Okay! Time to open your present to me! Oh! You did it again! You got me the best present in the history of PSSSD! This is perfect! This is amazing! This is incredible! I love it, I love it, I love it! [beat] What is it?"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] It's little pieces of cupcake-scented paper. You know, confetti. For your cannon."
Rarity,"You're right, that is impressive. But it's no fissure in the sidewalk."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] [to Boulder] Play nice.
Rarity,"Oh, I'm so relieved to see that you like the pouch. Especially considering what Pinkie Pie had to give up for it. [gasps] Oh!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] What?
Rarity,"I mean... forget I said that! I'm, I-I-I'm glad to see that you like the pouch. You can remember that part. Just forget the second part. You know, the second part where I said that Pinkie Pie had to give something up<U+0097> [shrieks] Perhaps I should just stop talking now. Nothing!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hee-hee, yay! I love my sister and my new confetti!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Why isn't she using her party cannon?
Rarity,Gahhhh...
Rarity,"[deliberately] Ooh! Wow, look how filthy my hooves are! I really should go wash them!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Where's her cannon?
Rarity,"No, no, stop, stop giving me that look! I can't take it! Nnnnn... [quickly] Pinkie Pie feels bad that the gifts that she always gives you are never as good as the ones that you give her!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] What?
Rarity,That's why she was willing to give up the party cannon for the pouch!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] She gave up her party cannon?
Rarity,Pinkie Pie! You might want to come over here for a second!
Pinkie Pie,"I think I know what this is about. You guys wanna ride the swans. Well, there are swan boats, but there are real swans here we can ri<U+0097>"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You gave away your party cannon?
Rarity,[inhales] She broke me.
Pinkie Pie,"Nnngh, it's just... It's just... It's just... You always give better gifts than me! That's why I had to get you the perfect gift! [beat] Are your hooves dirty? Where're you going?!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] To get your cannon back.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] There.
Pinkie Pie,Yep! That sure is the pony I got the pouch from!
Rarity,That's amazing! How did you know where he'd be?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Maud Sense.
Pinkie Pie,Runs in the family!
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please."
Others,"""Street Rat"": Sorry, missy, all sales are final."
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] [slightly more forcefully] I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please."
Rarity,"Ooh, I've never seen her like this! Look at the fire in her eyes! You'd better do what she says!"
Others,"""Street Rat"": Fire in her eyes?"
Rarity,Oh! Did she just clench her jaw?! I think she clenched her jaw!
Others,"""Street Rat"": I didn't see."
Rarity,"Oh, no! When she clenches her jaw... you know what that means?!"
Others,"""Street Rat"": What? What's it mean?"
Rarity,"Trust me, you do not want to know!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'd like to return this pouch.
Pinkie Pie,Maud! I'm so happy you got me my party cannon back! Yay!
Pinkie Pie,"Uh-oh. I just realized something. 'Cause you gave back the pouch for my cannon, this is now the second gift you've gotten me today! And it's something I really, really wanted! You did it again! Your gifts are always better than mine! Next year, I'm gonna have to really step it up and<U+0097>"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Pinkie, gift giving isn't a competition. It's an expression of love, and you always make sure to give your gifts with lots of love. That's why I'll always love them, and you, five-ever. That's even longer than for-ever."
Pinkie Pie,Awwww! [to Rarity] There you are! You've sure been washing your hooves for a long time! We've got a train to catch here!
Rarity,"I know, but there is one more sight you two simply must see before we leave."
Rarity,"Voila! Welcome to the future home of ""Rarity For You""! What do you think of the place? Is this the right location? Did I pick a good spot?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] No. You picked the perfect spot.
Pinkie Pie,"You know, I think this might be my favorite PSSSD ever! But I can't wait 'til next year's PSSS-D-W-R!"
Rarity,Wait. PSSS-D-W-R? What's that?
Pinkie Pie,P-S-S-S-D-W-R! It's a new tradition that Maud and I came up with! Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day...
Maud Pie,[deadpan] With Rarity.
Rarity,"Oh! Ohhh! Why, that's the sweetest... Oh, no. Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. I know how good you two are at giving gifts! I'm going to have to get you both something amazing, and I only have a year to do it!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Rarity! It doesn't matter what you get us! As long as you give your gift with love, it'll be perfect!"
Rarity,"[sighs] Why, thank you, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,Buuuut now that you mention it... I could use more confetti for my party cannon. You wouldn't believe how much of that stuff I go through in a day!
Apple Bloom,"Hear ye, hear ye! The first post-cutie mark meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session!"
Sweetie Belle,"Oh! I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I was distracted by the radiance of my cutie mark... Did you say something?"
Scootaloo,I mean... it's pretty amazing how the colors just pop off your flank. It's kinda hard to look aw<U+0097>
Apple Bloom,"Look, I know our cutie marks are amazing, but is that all we're gonna do now? Just spend our days starin' down at our own flanks?"
Sweetie Belle,[sighs] I guess not.
Scootaloo,"Yeah, I suppose that could get real boring..."
Apple Bloom,[wistfully] Yeah... [beat] This is ridiculous! We need to go out and do somethin'!
Sweetie Belle,"Wow, you're right!"
Scootaloo,"Yeah, we need to go try new stuff like we used to!"
Apple Bloom,Exactly.
Sweetie Belle,Like square dancing!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Yeah!
Apple Bloom,"And the more things we try, the more chances we'll have to finally get our cutie marks! Come on!"
Sweetie Belle,Um... Apple Bloom?
Apple Bloom,Wow... Did we really only ever do things just to get our cutie marks?
Sweetie Belle,I don't know. Maybe?
Scootaloo,"Aw, come on! We did lots of stuff that didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark."
Sweetie Belle,Of course we did!
Apple Bloom,Absolutely!
Sweetie Belle,"Huh. So now that we don't have to do stuff to get our cutie marks, what is it that the Cutie Mark Crusaders actually do?"
Apple Bloom,We do exactly what we got our cutie marks in!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Helping other ponies!
Scootaloo,Ponies without cutie marks!
Sweetie Belle,Or ponies who've forgotten their special purpose!
Apple Bloom,Exactly! We just have to find ponies who need our help! Come on!
Sweetie Belle,But are you sure you feel content?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Scootaloo,Not even a tinge of dissatisfaction?
Big McIntosh,Nnnope.
Apple Bloom,Not even the slightest naggin' sensation that you don't really know what your purpose is in life or why you have a big apple as a cutie mark?
Big McIntosh,[grunts] [spits] [annoyed] Nnnope.
Apple Bloom,The important thing to remember is that there is no rush.
Scootaloo,"The three of us tried for the longest time, but it just comes when it comes!"
Sweetie Belle,And it's totally normal to feel confused and maybe even a little lost. But being a blank flank is nothing to be ashamed of.
Scootaloo,So if you're having even the slightest problem...
Sweetie Belle,...or concerns or questions...
Apple Bloom,...we want you to know that we are here to help.
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. I... don't think they're too worried about it yet.
Apple Bloom,This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.
Sweetie Belle,Who knew there were so few ponies worried about their cutie marks?
Scootaloo,Kinda makes you wonder why we made such a big deal out of it for so long.
Scootaloo,What?
Apple Bloom,"The point is, helpin' ponies with cutie mark problems is what makes us special."
Sweetie Belle,But if we can't find anypony with a problem...
Scootaloo,...Maybe we're not special.
Bulk Biceps,"Yeah! I know exactly what you mean. You can't find a cutie mark problem. I have a cutie mark problem. It's so confusing, and I feel like the solution is staring me right in the muzzle."
Bulk Biceps,What?
Bulk Biceps,I see why you guys hang out here! It's cozy!
Scootaloo,"[straining] The Crusader Clubhouse is a safe place, Mr... um... Bulk."
Sweetie Belle,A place where we faced all kinds of cutie mark problems!
Apple Bloom,A place where we'll go on to solve even more! Startin' with yours!
Scootaloo,No matter how long it takes!
Sweetie Belle,Or how hard it is!
Apple Bloom,We'll solve it because that's what we do!
Bulk Biceps,Yeah!
Sweetie Belle,So... what's your cutie mark problem?
Bulk Biceps,"Oh, right. Uh, well, my cutie mark is a dumbbell, but I've lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville!"
Scootaloo,[nervously] Have you tried lifting other things?
Bulk Biceps,"You mean, not dumbbells?"
Sweetie Belle,Yeah!
Apple Bloom,Yeah!
Bulk Biceps,Yeah!
Bulk Biceps,Oof! I mean... no. I hadn't thought of that. You guys are awesome!
Bulk Biceps,But... what happens when I run out of other stuff?
Sweetie Belle,...I guess you could teach other ponies to lift things?
Apple Bloom,Yeah!
Scootaloo,Yeah!
Bulk Biceps,"Yeah! Wow, you three really have a knack for this!"
Sweetie Belle,That was easy!
Apple Bloom,Maybe too easy.
Scootaloo,What do you mean?
Apple Bloom,"Well, it's lookin' like cutie mark problems are few and far between."
Sweetie Belle,And...?
Apple Bloom,And what if we never find another one?
Scootaloo,Well...
Apple Bloom,"And even if we do, we could solve it so quick, it'll be like it never happened in the first place!"
Sweetie Belle,So...?
Apple Bloom,So... then the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't have any reason to exist!
Sweetie Belle,The problem boils down to this <U+0096> we don't need to go out and do things anymore to get our cutie marks.
Apple Bloom,Right! And<U+0097>
Scootaloo,Ponies with cutie mark problems are hard to find.
Apple Bloom,"Exactly. But even when we find problems, we're so good at solvin' them that most of the time there's nothin' for the Cutie Mark Crusaders to do. So..."
Apple Bloom,I thought we should start figurin' out ways to search all of Equestria for cutie mark problems!
Scootaloo,That kinda seems like a lot.
Sweetie Belle,I don't think Rarity would let me travel to the far reaches of Equestria looking for cutie mark problems.
Scootaloo,"Yeah, I'm sure we'll come across them in Ponyville. And when we do, we'll totally solve them because we are so awesome at it!"
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,Hoof!
Apple Bloom,But... what do we do until then?
Sweetie Belle,Maybe whatever we want?
Apple Bloom,What do you mean?
Sweetie Belle,"Well, we used to only do stuff to get our cutie marks or fulfill our destiny, but now we don't have to."
Apple Bloom,So... we can do things just for fun? Are you girls thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?!
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,Sure am!
Scootaloo,"Just remember <U+0096> stomp, kick, and roll! After this, you two are gonna love scootering as much as me!"
Apple Bloom,If you say so.
Scootaloo,"Ready? Stomp, kick, and roll! Whooo!"
Scootaloo,Ta-da!
Apple Bloom,[nervous laugh] I don't think I did it right.
Sweetie Belle,[blows pitch pipe] Do... Mi... So... It's just a simple harmony.
Scootaloo,"Harmony, huh?"
Sweetie Belle,"[tapping with baton] And a-one, and a-two, and a-one two three!"
Scootaloo,"Wow, that was simple!"
Apple Bloom,"It's just a dash, and a drop, and a drip!"
Apple Bloom,"Just a dash, and a drop, and a drip!"
Apple Bloom,...and even though Scootaloo thinks bungee jumping is the bee's knees...
Apple Bloom,...Sweetie Belle would rather keep bees.
Apple Bloom,"[spits] Of course, I'm allergic. Who'd've thought it'd be so hard to find somethin' for us all to do together?"
Scootaloo,"Well, I know this might sound crazy, but what if we didn't?"
Apple Bloom,Didn't what?
Scootaloo,"Do things together. Well, do everything together."
Apple Bloom,But we're the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Scootaloo,"And we always will be! But I really wanna bungee jump! The speed, the height, the fall!"
Sweetie Belle,"And I know you two aren't interested, but I wanna try crochet."
Scootaloo,Isn't there something you've always wanted to do on your own?
Apple Bloom,I don't know... I guess I figured we'd always do stuff together. But bungee jumping sounds just as scary as crochet sounds borin'.
Scootaloo,"That's okay. Sweetie Belle and I can do the things we like, and you can do whatever you like!"
Sweetie Belle,Just as soon as you figure out what it is.
Apple Bloom,I guess...
Scootaloo,Great! Then we can meet back here and talk all about what we've done!
Apple Bloom,But I don't know what it'll be.
Sweetie Belle,You'll find something!
Scootaloo,Something awesome!
Apple Bloom,[sighs] Well... I guess now I have to.
Apple Bloom,I never imagined myself out on my own Tryin' to find out what's next for me The Cutie Mark Crusaders have always been my home Maybe now there's more that I could be
Others,I guess as time goes by Everypony has to go out on their own And maybe someday I'll have to try Somethin' new that's just for me A little somethin' that could be Just my own and I won't feel so left behind
Others,We used to say that we'd be always side by side Maybe things are changin' and this could mean goodbye I always thought our friendship was all I'd ever need We've always been crusadin' <U+0096> what else is there for me?
Others,I guess as time goes by Everypony has to go out on their own And maybe someday I'll have to try Somethin' new that's just for me A little somethin' that could be Just my own and I won't feel so left behind
Hoofer Steps,"[muffled] And one, two, three, four, two, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, two, two, three, four<U+0097>"
Apple Bloom,"Whatever kind of dancin' y'all are doin', you're doin' it together, and I want in! [beat] I-I mean, uh, [clears throat] Would it be okay if I enrolled in this dance class?"
Hoofer Steps,"Well, let's see what you can do. We have a recital at town hall tonight, and a spot just opened up! [hushed] Tender Taps is a little too shy to perform. But if you're ready to step into a partnered routine..."
Apple Bloom,That sounds an awful lot like friendship! And I'm ready for anything I don't have to do by myself!
Apple Bloom,Whooooooa!
Apple Bloom,"Whoa, whoaaa!"
Apple Bloom,"Whew! I feel like that went pretty good, but let's give it one more whirl, because it's important that I do a good job partnering with my new group of friends."
Hoofer Steps,"Eh... Now I'm think of it, you might be better as soloist."
Hoofer Steps,"Uh, partnering is a little advanced for you. But there's still lots you can do on your own."
Apple Bloom,"I'm sorry, but doin' stuff on my own is exactly what I don't want."
Tender Taps,Sorry it didn't work out.
Apple Bloom,"Tryin' different things with my friends is always fun, even when we were terrible. Now it's just terrible."
Tender Taps,You weren't that bad. You just need to learn a few things on your own. Being a soloist can be fun! [tap dancing] Ha. Haha! You just have to do it with feeling!
Apple Bloom,"[sighs] Thanks, but... without my friends, I don't think I'll ever feel again. Good luck at the recital."
Tender Taps,"Oh, I'm not gonna do that. I mean, I want to. It's kind of all I think about. I bet some day my cutie mark will even be about performing! But I could never dance in front of an audience the way I do in class. That's t-t-t-t-terrifying!"
Apple Bloom,"[deadpan] Yeah, okay. Nice meetin' you."
Scootaloo,"Sweetie Belle! You are not gonna believe this, but I think I like bungee jumping even more than scootering!"
Sweetie Belle,Seriously?! That's amazing! Look what I did!
Scootaloo,"Wow, uh, that's, um..."
Sweetie Belle,"Horrible! But it was so much fun! Rarity showed me how, even though she says [imitating Rarity] ""Crochet is knitting's poorer cousin"", [normal] but I loved it!"
Scootaloo,Awesome!
Apple Bloom,"Oh, hello, girls. Have fun pursuing your own interests?"
Scootaloo,Apple Bloom? What are you doing sitting in the dark?
Sweetie Belle,"Yeah, we thought you'd be out looking for things you like to do."
Apple Bloom,[laughs] I did. I looked all over town. I looked... and I looked... and I looked... and you know what I found? Nothin'!
Scootaloo,You tried every one of these?
Apple Bloom,And each one just made me feel more alone than the next! I don't see how I'm supposed to be happy that we're not hanging out anymore!
Scootaloo,"Wait, I never said that. I just said we don't have to do everything together."
Sweetie Belle,Like when there's something one of us wants to do that the others don't.
Apple Bloom,"Oh. [beat] Well, I guess that changes things."
Scootaloo,I can't believe you thought we didn't want to hang out anymore.
Sweetie Belle,I can't believe you tried all this stuff and didn't find one thing you liked!
Apple Bloom,"Well, I kind of liked dancin', mainly because it looked like somethin' you couldn't do alone, but... I wasn't very good at it."
Sweetie Belle,"Well, you don't have to be good at something to have fun!"
Scootaloo,And being good doesn't always mean you will.
Apple Bloom,"I know... I met the best dancer in the world, but he was so shy, he couldn't bring himself to perform, even though he really, really wanted to."
Sweetie Belle,"I don't suppose this dancing pony had a cutie mark, did he?"
Apple Bloom,You're here!
Shoeshine,Shhhh!
Tender Taps,What are you doing here?
Apple Bloom,"You told me that you wanted to perform more than anythin', but I was too caught up in myself to listen. You're the best dancer I've ever seen, and I'm here to convince you to get out on that stage!"
Tender Taps,"Um, didn't I also tell you that dancing in front of other ponies is t-t-terrifying?! I don't know if you noticed, but that auditorium is full of other ponies! I can't go out there! What if I'm bad?!"
Apple Bloom,"We can go on together! No matter what, you'll look good dancin' next to me."
Tender Taps,"[sighs] All right, I'll do it. But I don't have my costume, and the backdrop is all wrong, and we don't have time to change it!"
Apple Bloom,Leave everything to us.
Tender Taps,[nervously] I don't know about this...
Sweetie Belle,"Don't worry, you'll be just fine!"
Apple Bloom,Here goes nothin'...
Apple Bloom,Can't be any worse than I was!
Tender Taps,"I can't believe it! It's just what I always imagined it would be! And if it weren't for all of you, I wouldn't even have it."
Scootaloo,No problem!
Sweetie Belle,It's what we do.
Apple Bloom,I only wish I'd realized what you needed right away instead of mopin' around for no reason...
Apple Bloom,"[taps] You know, I just might! It sure is a lot of fun, and I'm pretty confident I can only get better. [to the Crusaders] I'm sorry I was so silly about us all doin' our own things. If we hadn't, I might never even have tried dancin'!"
Tender Taps,Or find out I needed help!
Sweetie Belle,"With each of us going out and trying things on our own, we'll be three times as likely to find ponies to help!"
Scootaloo,"And trying new stuff might even make us better at helping them, like how I used my bungee jumping to change the sets!"
Sweetie Belle,Or my crochet to make the costumes!
Apple Bloom,"Well, one thing is for sure. The Cutie Mark Crusaders will never be the same. We'll be better!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Yeah!
Rarity,"[hushed] The last time I was here, I woke them and ended up with a mane full of bats! [sighs] Thanks for being my basket holder, Spike."
Spike,Basket holder? I thought I was your bodyguard.
Rarity,"[hushed] What? Oh, heh, yes, yes, that of course, too. Oh, for once I wish unicorn magic wasn't so... luminescent!"
Rarity,[hushed] Spike! You'll wake the bats! Turn that off!
Twilight Sparkle,I'm so glad you two could come!
Princess Luna,Of course. We so rarely get a chance to relax and just visit.
Princess Celestia,There's usually some crisis we have to deal with. Somepony always needs our help. But today<U+0097>
Rarity,"[muffled, wailing] Help!"
Rarity,Twilight! There's something wrong with Spike!
Twilight Sparkle,What's wrong?
Spike,"[grunts] I don't know! Nngh! All of a sudden, my scales just started glowing and... burning!"
Princess Luna,"Little is known about dragon culture, but this is a phenomenon we've seen before. It is the call of the Dragon Lord."
Princess Celestia,Dragons glow whenever the Dragon Lord has need of them in the Dragon Lands.
Spike,Great... H-How do I make it stop?!
Princess Luna,The only way to end the summons is to answer it. You must journey to the Dragon Lands and see what is expected of you.
Rarity,"B-B-But the Dragon Lands are full of... dragons! And they're ghastly creatures! [beat] Oh, oh, not you, of course, Spikey-wikey. But remember that rotten Garble?"
Spike,"[gulps] How could I forget? He would have burnt us to a crisp if you weren't there. If I have to go to the Dragon Lands, would you two come with me?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ooh! Oh my goodness, I'd love to! We are sadly lacking any information on dragon culture and customs. I could research them <U+0096> maybe even write an article! This could be my chance to make a great contribution to the knowledge of Equestria! [beat] And be there for Spike, heh, of course."
Princess Celestia,Be very careful. The Dragon Lands are particularly dangerous for ponies. It would be wise to be discreet.
Twilight Sparkle,I think we might want something a little more practical this time.
Rarity,"Hmmm... Well, it may be practical, but this disguise isn't flattering in the slightest!"
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] It's not supposed to be flattering. It's supposed to blend in!
Spike,Shh!
Garble,"Hey-hey, look! It's our old friend Sparkle-warkle."
Spike,It's Spike.
Garble,Are you sure your pony friends didn't give you a pony name?
Spike,"It's nice to see you too, Garble."
Garble,I didn't say it was nice to see you. It's not. I don't like you. Was I not clear about that?
Spike,Hey! That's my rock!
Garble,"Oh, really? Then why aren't you sitting on it?"
Dragon Lord Torch,"Dragons of Equestria, hear me! I have been Dragon Lord for longer than many of you can remember, and my reign has been extraordinary! [beat] Agree with me!"
Dragons,[general agreeing noises] Torch! Torch! Torch! Torch!
Spike,Who is that?
Garble,"It's Dragon Lord Torch, dummy."
Spike,"No, next to him."
Garble,"That's his daughter, Princess Ember. I wouldn't even look at her if I were you, unless you want Torch to eat you!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] This is fascinating! Dragons are notoriously reckless, but they do whatever the Dragon Lord says!"
Dragon Lord Torch,"Unfortunately, according to dragon law, it is time for me to step down. Sad, I know. [beat] Be sad!"
Dragon Lord Torch,This is why I have summoned you <U+0096> to compete for the throne in the Gauntlet of Fire!
Dragon Lord Torch,Whomever has the strength and fortitude to retrieve this bloodstone scepter from the heart of the flame-cano will be crowned Lord of the Dragons!
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] When the scepter disappeared, the dragons stopped glowing! We are learning so much!"
Spike,"Uh, excuse me!"
Garble,"Ugh, you even sneeze like a pony!"
Dragon Lord Torch,"The Gauntlet is dangerous, for I designed it myself! Only dragons with my ferocity, strength, and determination will be able to finish. We will gather at the cliff when the sun is at its peak!"
Spike,"I don't want to be Dragon Lord or dragon toast, and I stopped glowing, so let's sneak out of here!"
Dragon Lord Torch,"Ah! Where do you think you're going, little dragon?!"
Spike,"Oh, uh, hi, your Lordship. Uh, I was just going home!"
Dragon Lord Torch,You don't get to leave unless I say you can!
Princess Ember,"Dad, look at him. He's just a runt. Besides, he doesn't even wanna compete. Let him go."
Dragon Lord Torch,"That wasn't a joke. It was a fact. When I want you to laugh, I will say ""be amused!"""
Spike,"Of course, your Lordship! I, uh, guess I don't understand dragon customs. Another reason why I shouldn't compete."
Dragon Lord Torch,"[sighs] Hm. Very well then, little dragon. I release you."
Spike,Thank you! [to Ember] And thank you.
Dragon Lord Torch,[grunts] Where do you think you're going?
Princess Ember,To prepare for the Gauntlet.
Dragon Lord Torch,"No, you're not. You're not much bigger than that runt I just sent home!"
Princess Ember,But I'm smarter than most of these boulderheads and you know it!
Dragon Lord Torch,"Being smart won't help you win this Gauntlet! It was designed for a big, strong dragon to win, because it takes a big, strong dragon to lead! Besides, I said no!"
Princess Ember,[growls] I hate when he does that!
Maar,"Ha. When I become Dragon Lord, I will make burps an official greeting!"
Others,"""Barry"": Ha, you? Please! When I win, I will pillage Equestria for all their pillows. Why should these ponies be comfortable while we sleep on rocks?"
Garble,"That's nothing! When I'm in charge, the first thing I'll do is get revenge on those puny ponies! They'll regret they ever crossed Garble! We'll take whatever we want from Equestria and burn the rest!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] Oh, my gosh!"
Rarity,"[hushed] Ooh, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hope that burping dragon wins!"
Spike,None of them can win! Equestria's in big trouble if any of them are in charge!
Twilight Sparkle,But what can we do?
Spike,"There's only one thing to do, and only I can do it! I have to win the Gauntlet of Fire!"
Twilight Sparkle and Rarity,Oh...
Rarity,What do you mean you have to win the Gauntlet?
Spike,"It's the only way to protect Equestria from the dragons. You heard them! They have horrible plans for ponies if they win! So somehow, I have to do it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"There has to be another way. It's too dangerous. Besides, if you win, you'd have to stay here!"
Spike,"I know, but there's no other way to keep my friends safe."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, if you're staying to compete, then we're staying to cheer you on!"
Dragon Lord Torch,"I thought I released you, tiny one!"
Spike,"I decided to compete. I am a dragon, after all."
Garble,Are you sure? You can't even fly!
Garble,Good luck! Just kidding. I hope you lose.
Spike,"[gasps] [sarcastically] Thanks, Garble! I was planning on swimming anyway!"
Rarity,"You can do it, Spike!"
Spike,He's gonna drown!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike!
Spike,"Hey, are you okay?"
Spike,[gasps] Princess Ember!
Princess Ember,What do you think you're doing?
Rarity,Only saving your ungrateful scales!
Princess Ember,Did that seaweed just talk? Ponies?! What are they doing here?!
Spike,They're my friends!
Princess Ember,Friends? Dragons don't do friends.
Spike,"Well, this dragon does."
Princess Ember,Whatever. I don't care as long as none of you get in my way. I have a Gauntlet to win.
Spike,But I thought your dad said that<U+0097>
Princess Ember,I don't care what my dad said! I'll show him and every dragon who thinks I'm just a little princess there are better things than being big and strong!
Garble,"[scream] [grunts] Don't leave me here, Spike!"
Garble,Ha-ha! Knew you'd do it. Your pony friends made you soft.
Spike,Uh-huh. You're welcome.
Princess Ember,"[gruff voice] Uh, that's just me. I, uh, robbed some ponies on my way over here."
Garble,"Huh, I like your style. Have I met you before? You kind of look like<U+0097>"
Spike,"My, uh, old neighbor! Uh, Sandy... Rockbeach!"
Garble,Stupid slingtails knocked me down! But I've wasted enough time making small talk. Get it? Ha-ha! Because you're too small to win this! I'm funny.
Princess Ember,Why did you cover for me? You could've had one less competitor.
Spike,I could ask you the same thing. You could've told Garble about my friends.
Princess Ember,Yikes... That looks rough. But that's what makes it a challenge.
Spike,"Are you kidding? Those boulders are huge! Hey, what if we worked together? You fly me up there, and I'll help look out for boulders, like a second set of eyes!"
Rarity,Pssst!
Rarity,[hushed] Spike! Are you sure it's a good idea to team up with Ember? You don't know her too well.
Spike,"I do know she could've told Garble about you, but she didn't. I think we can trust her."
Twilight Sparkle,Her behavior does seem contradictory to everything I've noted about dragons so far.
Princess Ember,"Hey, you, little fella! I've thought about it, and your plan makes sense. Let's do it."
Spike,Really? Great! It's a deal!
Princess Ember,"Just so you know, this doesn't mean we're gonna pick flowers or exchange necklaces or whatever pony friends do."
Twilight Sparkle,Good luck. We'll meet you at the top.
Spike,Pull up! There's one on your tail!
Spike,Go left!
Spike,So what do we do now?
Princess Ember,I think we go through there.
Rarity,"[yelps] Oh, that looks scary! I mean, you can do it!"
Princess Ember,"Listen, Spike. I wouldn't have made it this far without you. So I guess, if you want to, we could keep working together. I mean, just until we get through that tunnel."
Spike,Okay!
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] We'll be right behind you!
Spike,[gasps] Oof!
Garble,Urgh!
Rarity,"Oh, you made it! Oh, we were so worried!"
Princess Ember,Wait. How did you two get through?
Spike,Rarity!
Rarity,"[yelps] [panting] Oh, thanks, Spike!"
Spike,[sighs] It was nothing.
Princess Ember,Nothing? You just risked everything to save her! And they're putting themselves in danger just to support you!
Spike,"Well, that's just what friends do. Don't you have anyone who looks out for you?"
Princess Ember,"Not really. Unless I count you. [beat] Which I don't! Because we were only helping each other get through the tunnel, and now we're through the tunnel, so that's it."
Spike,"Wait, what do you mean?"
Princess Ember,"Well, there's only one winner, one scepter, and one Dragon Lord. So I guess it's every dragon for themselves."
Spike,Oh. So we aren't really friends?
Princess Ember,"Maybe if we were in Ponyland, but like I said, dragons don't do friendship."
Spike,I can't believe Ember ditched me.
Rarity,"[muffled] Oh, you're better off. She was only looking out for herself. She's just like all the other dragons."
Spike,"She's not, though. I know it. She saved me, even when she didn't have to. I don't care what she says. That makes us friends."
Twilight Sparkle,"Is it just me, or have we seen this crevasse three times already?"
Spike,It's kinda hard to tell. They all look the same. Except for this one! Look! We made it! I can't believe I'm the only dragon to make it this far!
Garble,You're not! And I'm not losing to a puny pony-loving dragon like you!
Rarity,[yelps] [muffled] We have to do something!
Twilight Sparkle,[muffled] Look!
Spike,[screaming] Ember! I thought it was every dragon for themselves! Why did you save me?!
Princess Ember,"That's what friends do! And I am. I mean, we are. I never should have left you back there. Agh, please don't make me talk about my feelings!"
Garble,[straining] Argh! Whoa!
Garble,[frustrated grunt] I'm sick and tired of you two helping each other! Dragons don't do helping!
Spike,[panting] Whoa...
Spike,Leave her alone!
Garble,What? You?! You have the scepter?! But that means that you're...
Princess Ember,The Dragon Lord. Dragon Lord Spike.
Garble,[groans] [reluctantly] Dragon... Lord... Spike...
Spike,"That's right! Uh... Now, go start your long journey home. And give every dragon you see on the way a hug. Don't tell them why."
Garble,Awww! But that'll be super embarrassing!
Spike,I command you to do it!
Garble,[annoyed noise] I can't believe this...
Princess Ember,"Dragon Lord Spike. Hm, has a nice ring to it."
Spike,Dragon Lord Ember sounds a lot better.
Princess Ember,What? No. You're the Dragon Lord now.
Spike,"The Dragon Lord is whoever brings the scepter back to your father! Besides, you'll make a great leader. I was just doing this to protect the ponies. But I know you'll protect them just as well as I would have."
Princess Ember,You sure about this?
Spike,Absolutely. My home is in Equestria with my friends.
Princess Ember,"Well, you'll have at least one friend here too. What are you doing?"
Spike,It's called a hug!
Princess Ember,Oh. I don't know if I like it. But... okay.
Spike,Mmmmm!
Twilight Sparkle,[hushed] Awww!
Dragon Lord Torch,Ember? You?!
Princess Ember,"I know you didn't think I could do it, but I did."
Dragon Lord Torch,"I expressly told you not to do it, because you're not<U+0097>!"
Princess Ember,I'm not big and strong. I know. But you know what? I won anyway. So maybe it takes more than just being big and strong to be a good Dragon Lord!
Dragon Lord Torch,"I was wrong, Ember. You might not be big, but you are strong and smart, and perhaps that counts for more than I thought. And you will make an excellent leader."
Princess Ember,"Thanks, dad. [to dragons] Agree with him! Just kidding! That's not gonna be my thing."
Dragon Lord Torch,"[laughing] Dragons, hear me! I present to you our new Dragon Lord, Ember!"
Dragon Lord Torch,[to Garble] Hm? What is the meaning of this?!
Garble,I can't tell you!
Twilight Sparkle,"You did well, Spike. With Ember as Dragon Lord, the ponies will be safe and you've gained us a powerful ally."
Spike,And a new friend!
Twilight Sparkle,"Plus, Ember said I could write to her anytime I had questions about dragon culture! With this much information, I'll be able to write a whole book on dragons!"
Rarity,"And I gained tons of ideas for a new line of camouflage clothing! I think I'll call it ""Camo-Maud""!"
Twilight Sparkle,"First lesson of the day, we very carefully set the table without using magic, so that<U+0097> Yikes!"
Twilight Sparkle,Did you...?! How? When? What?!
Starlight Glimmer,What?
Twilight Sparkle,I said no magic. You were supposed to do it by hoof so I could work in a friendship lesson.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, I heard ""set the table"" and just kinda went for it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, if you hadn't used magic, you'd have heard me say, uh... this plate represents your head, this spoon is your heart, and the knives... are sharp! Always be careful with knives. [sigh] The metaphors make more sense when you're actually setting the table."
Starlight Glimmer,Should I... change it back?
Twilight Sparkle,I just want to make sure you're ready for this dinner. Princess Celestia will be joining us tomorrow night to see how the friendship lessons are going!
Starlight Glimmer,"If it's just you, me, and Princess Celestia, why are there four seats?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, the whole point is for you to bring a new friend. That way, the princess will see for herself just how far you've come. And how good a teacher you have."
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I can't choose. I like all your friends."
Twilight Sparkle,That's the best part! You have to make a new friend!
Starlight Glimmer,"New friends? Hey, maybe I'll just force friendships by magically enslaving the entire population of Ponyville!"
Twilight Sparkle,Starlight!
Starlight Glimmer,"Let's see. Make new friends in Ponyville, the friendliest place in Equestria. Shouldn't be hard..."
Pinkie Pie,"Need to make a new friend, huh? I know just the pony for you!"
Pinkie Pie,"Miss Starlight Glimmer, meet Mrs. Cake!"
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. How are you, dearie?"
Starlight Glimmer,Are you baking? Can I help?
Pinkie Pie,"Wow, Mrs. Cake! Look what your new friend made you!"
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. [chuckles] New friend. I like the sound of<U+0096> [gasps] Howza-wowza! A-Are you trying to put me out of business with your fancy magical-thingy-whatsit cake?!
Starlight Glimmer,Sorry...
Applejack,"I think I have just the pony for you, Starlight. Meet Big Mac!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Applejack,He's not much of a talker.
Big McIntosh,Nnope.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, that's too bad. I love a good conversation."
Big McIntosh,[motormouth] Eeyup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-y-y-y-y-you did something! Whoa! What's happening? I feel really weird! I'm talkin' so much! And I'm so articulate! Enunciating with such precise pronunciation! Annie Apple awoke and accidentally ate an auburn azalea! [screams] Make it stop!
Starlight Glimmer,I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk.
Starlight Glimmer,...And I guess my first instinct shouldn't be to magically command ponies to act the way I want them to?
Starlight Glimmer,"Alright, I'll change him back!"
Rarity,"The trick to finding a new friend is to render yourself radiant. First impressions count a great deal, you know."
Starlight Glimmer,I'm glad you all got past my first impression.
Rarity,"Well, everypony deserves a second chance. Ooh! Now, I have a top-notch idea. I'm thinking pastel silk here and here with a crinoline underneath."
Starlight Glimmer,You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies?
Rarity,"Oh, with the right outfit, you can do anything, darling!"
Starlight Glimmer,When will it be ready?
Rarity,Three weeks.
Starlight Glimmer,Dinner's tomorrow.
Rarity,"Well then, how about a hat from the... [clears throat] ...clearance bin?"
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh! Maybe not.
Rainbow Dash,Heh. Nopony's gonna make friends with you because of your outfit. The only thing you want a new friend draped in is coolness.
Starlight Glimmer,Like you?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, but you already know me, so... [gasps] [spitting] Spitfire! Heh. Sorry."
Starlight Glimmer,Who's that?
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps] Only the Wonderbolt-iest pony in the Wonderbolts! Come on, I'll introduce you!"
Rainbow Dash,You coming or what?
Starlight Glimmer,"I guess my first question would be, ""What's a Wonderbolt?"""
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] You've never heard of the Wonderbolts?! Where have you been?!
Starlight Glimmer,"[nervously] Enslaving villages, I guess..."
Rainbow Dash,Right.
Starlight Glimmer,"You're adorable, but probably not what Twilight had in mind."
Starlight Glimmer,"[groan] What is going on? This is Ponyville! If I can't make a friend here, there's gotta be something wrong with me! [sighs] Okay, calm down. Nobody makes friends with a total stresscase."
Starlight Glimmer,[to herself] Stop stressing... Stop stressing!
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] This is just what I needed.
Trixie,[sighs] Tell me about it.
Starlight Glimmer,You ever have one of those days?
Trixie,"For me, they're all one of those days."
Trixie,I'm gonna start coming here every time I visit Ponyville.
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm not from here either. I've been trying to make friends, but it's not easy. They're not saying it, but I think everypony knows about my past. I may have been a tiny bit... completely and utterly evil?"
Trixie,Ponies judge me on my past too.
Starlight Glimmer,"Finally, a pony I can relate to."
Starlight Glimmer,"Twilight, guess what? I made a new friend!"
Twilight Sparkle,That's fantastic news!
Starlight Glimmer,She's great!
Twilight Sparkle,Great!
Starlight Glimmer,She's powerful!
Twilight Sparkle,Powerful?
Starlight Glimmer,She's<U+0097>
Trixie,Hello... princess!
Twilight Sparkle,Trixie?!
Starlight Glimmer,You know each other?
Twilight Sparkle,You could say that.
Trixie,"We've had our differences. What matters is Twilight gave me a second chance, and I appreciate it."
Twilight Sparkle,"So, um, what brings you to Ponyville?"
Trixie,"The Grrrreat and Powerful Trrrrixie has come to perform a new stage show of grand illusion! I am calling it ""The Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour""!"
Starlight Glimmer,[hushed] That's kind of a mouthful.
Trixie,[hushed] It's a working title.
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight? A moment? Over here? [hushed] I know I said make friends with anypony, but, well, with Trixie's past, and your past, I'm not sure she's the best... first friend."
Starlight Glimmer,"But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,Of course. It's just... She wasn't the nicest pony.
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, you did say anypony, and I just assumed that you'd trust me to make my own friends the way Princess Celestia trusted you."
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] You're right. I trust you. Just be back in time for the dinner.
Starlight Glimmer,"Thanks, Twilight! You won't regret it!"
Trixie,This magic show's gonna be the greatest thing Ponyville's ever seen!
Cherry Berry and Goldengrape,[unintelligible whispering] ...did you see...?
Others,"Caramel, Shoeshine, [unintelligible whispering] ...did you hear...?"
Trixie,"Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget."
Starlight Glimmer,That's what I'm worried about.
Starlight Glimmer,What is it?
Trixie,"I heard what Twilight said about me, and she's right. I wasn't very nice. So I'd understand if you didn't want to be friends."
Starlight Glimmer,Are you kidding? You're the first pony I've met who has any idea how I feel!
Trixie,Can you keep a secret?
Starlight Glimmer,What are friends for?
Trixie,"[hushed] The things I've done? I did them because I was jealous of Twilight. She's just the best at everything, and I wanted to beat her at something!"
Starlight Glimmer,[hushed] Your secret's safe with me.
Trixie,Thanks. Want to help me unpack my wagon?
Trixie,"I spend a lot of time on the road with my wagon, so it might be a tad messy."
Starlight Glimmer,"Maybe I can help. I'm pretty good at organizing stuff. Magic props, brainwashed crowds..."
Twilight Sparkle,Pssssssst! Pssst! Psssssst! Shhhhhh!
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, I'll catch up. I think there's something in my hoof."
Trixie,Sure. The wagon's right around the corner.
Twilight Sparkle,"[hushed] So, how's it going with your new friend?"
Starlight Glimmer,[sarcastically] Great. Thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way.
Twilight Sparkle,"Because you know, if it isn't working out for any reason, I could introduce you to my friend here."
Starlight Glimmer,[deadpan] Nice to meet you.
Twilight Sparkle,"No, no! You can come out now!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You like music, right? DJ Pon-3'd be the perfect friend for tonight's incredibly important dinner with Celestia. You know, if you decide to make a last-minute change. Heh."
Starlight Glimmer,"So back at your castle when you said ""I trust you"", you meant ""I don't trust you""."
Twilight Sparkle,[nervously] Who can really say who said what? I know I can't! [to DJ Pon-3] Can you?
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, I'm just trying to look out for you."
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] I appreciate it, but you're wrong about Trixie. She's just like me. We have a real connection."
Twilight Sparkle,That's kind of what I'm afraid of. Oh! What about her?
Starlight Glimmer,"Please, Twilight! I know you're trying to help, but I need to make friends on my own if I'm going to become a better pony."
Twilight Sparkle,But do you really think Trixie's the one to help you with that?
Starlight Glimmer,Wow. Trixie was right. You're not really giving her a second chance. I wonder what that says about how you feel about me.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh! Now he'd be perfect!
Starlight Glimmer,"I was thinking. You said Twilight is better than you at everything, but that's not true. You're better at magic."
Trixie,"Only when I'm wearing a soul-sucking evil amulet, so I don't think that counts. Funny story. Don't need to get into it."
Starlight Glimmer,I meant stage magic.
Trixie,"Well, of course! Great? Yes. Powerful? Obviously. But I'm not the best. As great and powerful as I am, there's one trick I've never been able to do <U+0096> the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive!"
Trixie,"[narrating] Only one magician has ever pulled it off <U+0096> my hero, Hoofdini! You are supposed to blast yourself into the open mouth of a hungry manticore! After the manticore chews you up and swallows you, you magically step out of a box on the other side of the stage!"
Trixie,Completely unharmed!
Starlight Glimmer,That sounds very...
Trixie,Dangerous?
Starlight Glimmer,I was gonna say cool!
Trixie,"I knew I liked you for a reason. I don't know how he did it! If I tried it, I'd get chewed up and swallowed by that manticore."
Starlight Glimmer,Not if you could use real magic.
Trixie,Obviously. Way to rub it in.
Starlight Glimmer,"No, I mean, I could help! You could start the trick, and right before you got chewed up, I could use magic to save you..."
Starlight Glimmer,...and make you appear in the black box!
Trixie,"I guess that would work... But if you made one mistake, I'd be a goner."
Starlight Glimmer,"Hah. When it comes to magic, I don't make mistakes. Maybe I could be your... magic show helper pony!"
Trixie,"We call it ""assistant"" in the magician biz. And... nopony's ever offered to help before."
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I'd be honored."
Trixie,You may have just made my great and powerful magic show even better! Which I didn't think was possible! We're gonna blow them away tonight!
Starlight Glimmer,[groans] I can't! Tonight's this incredibly important dinner with Twilight.
Trixie,Oh.
Starlight Glimmer,Can I vent for a minute?
Trixie,What are friends for?
Starlight Glimmer,"Even after Twilight says she trusts me, she clearly doesn't trust me enough to choose my own friends. [sighs] I guess you were right. No second chances."
Trixie,"Hmph, I wish I could say I was surprised. Well, lucky for Princess Twilight, I have my magic show tonight. If you have to go to the dinner, I completely understand. [dramatically] I just hope I find a way to survive the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive without my new assistant!"
Twilight Sparkle,Starlight? Has anyone seen Starlight Glimmer? I'm looking for her! Trixie.
Pinkie Pie,So this is the Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour?
Applejack,Ain't that a mouthful of molasses.
Trixie,"It's a working title! Oh, this is gonna be the greatest night of my life! Excuse me. Our lives."
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] I'm so glad we're not at that boring dinner.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ahem? You just decided to skip our dinner without telling me? Are you aware that, at this very moment, Princess Celestia is waiting for you at a table with exquisite silverware placement?!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Yes, but<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with Trixie.
Trixie,"A-ha! You still don't trust me! But guess what, princess? It doesn't matter if you want to give me a second chance or not. Starlight had to choose between you and me, and she chose me! Your pupil chose me, so ha! I win!"
Starlight Glimmer,You win? That sounds like you just made friends with me to beat Twilight.
Trixie,"Exactly! [beat] Wait! I mean, no! I got caught up in the moment. I like you. Beating Twilight is just a bonus. [gasps] Saying that didn't help, did it?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, you won. I hope you're happy!"
Trixie,[sighs] Looks like the Great and Powerful Trixie is back to a solo show.
Twilight Sparkle,Trixie?
Trixie,"...Which is exactly the way she likes it! Thank you, Princess Twilight, for getting rid of that annoying pony who wanted to be my first friend! I am not sad at all! I definitely don't feel as if my heart is breaking into a million pieces!"
Trixie,"[unenthusiastic] Come one, come all. Come and see the Pathetic and Friendless Trixie's ""Way-To-Go-Dum-Dum-You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-Time Repentance Tour""."
Trixie,"It's a working title! [unenthusiastic] Behold, your fears come true. A pony-eating manticore."
Trixie,"[unenthusiastic] For tonight, the Great and Powerful Trixie will be performing the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive."
Trixie,"[unenthusiastic] Now, now, save your gasps for when I defy the beast's jaws of doom and appear inside that black box. [dramatically] I was supposed to perform this trick with my great and powerful assistant, who was also my great and powerful friend!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, when I first came to Ponyville, Princess Celestia gave me room to make my own decisions and my own friends. I need to give you the same freedom. I shouldn't have tried to pick and choose your friends for you. Just like me, you have to make your own decisions and your own friends."
Starlight Glimmer,But... what if Trixie really was using me just to one-up you?
Twilight Sparkle,"From what I've seen, she's the real thing."
Twilight Sparkle,But it's not my place to judge. It's all up to you.
Trixie,"Starlight? If you're out there and you still want to be friends, let's be great and powerful together! [slightly echoing] Please?"
Trixie,"[woozy] Behold, the Peat and Growerful Triskie...!"
Trixie,"[amplified] And now, I'm proud to introduce my great and powerful assistant! [normal] And best friend. [amplified] Starlight Glimmer!"
Twilight Sparkle,Trixie!
Trixie,What do you want?
Twilight Sparkle,I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I have to hand it to you. I could never have pulled off a trick like that.
Trixie,"Thank you, princess."
Cranky Doodle Donkey,How do you get your hair to do that all the time?
Scootaloo,Hey! Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,"Hiya, Scootaloo! What's up?"
Scootaloo,The Rainbow Dash Fan Club just decided <U+0096> everypony's coming to see you when the Wonderbolts' new tour comes through Ponyville!
Rainbow Dash,"Well, it's great that you guys are going to the show, Scoot, but I won't actually be performing in it. Reservists aren't in the show unless one of the real Wonderbolts can't fly. [chuckles] I'll probably be working crowd control or something."
Scootaloo,"You're still gonna be wearing a Wonderbolts uniform though, right?"
Rainbow Dash,"A Reservist one, yeah."
Scootaloo,Hmm. That's good enough for me.
Scootaloo,Whoa!
Spitfire,Rainbow Dash! Glad we found you. We need you in the show when we get to Ponyville. Flying.
Scootaloo,But she's only in the Reserves!
Spitfire,"Not anymore, kid."
Rainbow Dash,[slow gasp] You mean...
Scootaloo,"[gasps] Rainbow Dash! You're finally a full-fledged Wonderbolt! Woo-hoo! [laughs] Yeah, Rainbow Dash! Whoo!"
Spitfire,Heh. What she said.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, anypony seen my wing balm? I don't want to be stiff when I show up at Wonderbolt headquarters."
Spike,Got it!
Twilight Sparkle,"Do you have time to tell us what happened, Rainbow Dash?"
Rarity,"Oh, yes, we must know every detail!"
Pinkie Pie,Start from when you were a foal and you first knew your destiny was to become a Wonderbolt!
Rainbow Dash,"Heh. Well, not much to tell, really. Spitfire told me the Wonderbolts need me to go on tour with them."
Fluttershy,That's really great. I know how long you've been waiting for a spot to open up.
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. Fire Streak decided to retire and teach full-time. Cloudsdale Flight School will probably be churning out Wonderbolts with him there. But guess who was at the top of the Reserve list.
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, ooh, I know! Pick me!"
Rarity,"So what do you do now, Dashie?"
Rainbow Dash,"I have to report to Wonderbolts headquarters this afternoon. It's only two days 'til tour starts, and I need to learn the routine."
Pinkie Pie,You're leaving already?! [gasps] But we barely started your congratulation party! I haven't even thought about your going-away party yet!
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie, I'm not leaving Ponyville. I just have to train for this show."
Fluttershy,I hope everything goes well. Sounds like an awful lot of pressure having to learn everything so quickly.
Applejack,"Yeah. Good luck, Dash."
Rainbow Dash,Luck? Heh. Save that for the rest of the team.
Rainbow Dash,"Now that my awesomeness has finally been recognized, the other Wonderbolts will have to keep up or eat my cloud trail!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Everypony knows you're a great flyer, Rainbow Dash, but so are the rest of the Wonderbolts. It might be more challenging than you think."
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, you're right! I mean, do I show up wearing sunglasses or not? Sunglasses are automatically cool, but anypony can put them on. Maybe I'd stand out more if I didn't."
Spitfire,Team briefings are every morning at<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"0720, because there were twenty ponies in the original E.U.P. Guard that became the Wonderbolts!"
Spitfire,"Right. And I know you've seen the academy bunks, but these are the official Wonderbolts barracks."
Rainbow Dash,Built by Admiral Fairweather himself!
Spitfire,"Don't forget rule number one, newbie. Always check both ways before crossing the runway."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, sure, but... nopony else is here."
Spitfire,"They will be, and most of the Wonderbolts like to make a flashy entrance, so stay alert."
Rainbow Dash,"Right, no problem!"
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! Is that General Flash's cap?!
Spitfire,And the original crest with the Wonderbolts motto on it.
Rainbow Dash and Spitfire,"""Altius volantis! Soaring higher!"""
Rainbow Dash,"Wow! [gasps] I mean, ha, cool."
Spitfire,"Okay, newbie, we've got a show in two days, which means you gotta hustle your haunches to learn this routine. You got five minutes to get dressed and get outside to meet the rest of the team."
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, ma'am! I'll have all of the moves down by the end of the day!"
Spitfire,Let's hope so. We're all expecting you to make quite an impression.
Rainbow Dash,"Lookin' good! Okay, you're about to take your first flight as an actual Wonderbolt. [sighs] No pressure. [stretching groan] Just gotta go out there and knock 'em off their hooves. Okay, Wonderbolts, get ready to meet your most awesome member ever!"
Spitfire,"Hey, look out!"
Rainbow Dash,Huh? Whooaaa!
Misty Fly,"Whoa, most awesome entrance by a newbie ever."
Soarin,"Are you okay, Rainbow Dash?"
Fleetfoot,More like Rainbow Crash.
Young Rainbow Dash,"Okay, flight school! Get ready for Rainbow Dash! Hah<U+0097>whooooa!"
Young Hoops,More like Rainbow Crash!
Young Hoops and Young Pegasi,Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash!
Rainbow Dash,Hey! You guys buzzed me on purpose!
Spitfire,"Not quite. You forgot rule number one, newbie."
Others,"Surprise, Fleetfoot, High Winds, Always check both ways before crossing the runway."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, well, I was just... testing you guys!"
Spitfire,"Alright, nopony got hurt and we got a lot to do, so let's forget about this and get flying!"
Misty Fly,"Classic rookie move, Rainbow Crash. That was amazing."
Spitfire,"[through loudhailer] Higher, Crash! You're breaking formation!"
Soarin,"Check your nine, Crash!"
Spitfire,"Tighter, Crash, get in there!"
Rainbow Dash,[growls] My name's not Crash!
Surprise,"Huh, could've fooled me."
Fleetfoot,"Hey, Crash, I know it was a tough day today, but don't worry. You'll get the hang of it."
Rainbow Dash,"Tough day? Please. If I can pull off a sonic rainboom, I can learn this routine. I'll have it down cold tomorrow. Probably even come up with a couple of improvements."
Spitfire,"Rainbow Dash, over here!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire,I'm glad you're still here.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, yeah? Did you want some ideas on how to make the show extra-awesome?"
Spitfire,"Not quite. I know you've been a Reservist for a while, but the 'Bolts have a few of their own rules you might not know about. Like worst flyer of the day has to clean up the whole compound. Better get to it, Crash."
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] [under her breath] My name's not Crash.
Rest of main cast and Cutie Mark Crusaders,Surprise!
Rainbow Dash,What?
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Hooray, Rainbow Dash! Our favorite Wonderbolt!"
Twilight Sparkle,"We know you're probably tired, Rainbow Dash, but Pinkie wanted to throw you a real party."
Pinkie Pie,Your best day [through megaphone] ever party!
Rainbow Dash,"[nervous laugh] Yeah. It was somethin', all right."
Applejack,Well we can't wait to hear all about it!
Rainbow Dash,"Heh. And I'd love to tell you, I really would, but I'm pretty beat. [yawns] You know, from all the... excitement of my big day?"
Fluttershy,"Um, is something wrong, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,"What could be wrong? I'm finally a Wonderbolt, which means everything has to be totally, perfectly awesome."
Rarity,"Oh, no. Something is wrong. What happened, darling?"
Rainbow Dash,"I told you, it's nothing! I mean, maybe some of the Wonderbolts started calling me Rainbow Crash..."
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! Isn't that the same terrible nickname those bullies in flight school used to call you?"
Twilight Sparkle,Why would they call you that?
Twilight Sparkle,Urgh.
Pinkie Pie,"Well, look at the bright side! At least they didn't call you Rainbow Trash!"
Applejack,So you started off on the wrong hoof. I'll bet every new Wonderbolt has a tough first day.
Rarity,"Mmm-hmm! What you need is to find a positive way to stand out. As soon as you're known for something else, that nasty old nickname will be forgotten."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity's right. Why don't you think of the Wonderbolts like us? We're a team, but we all stand out in different ways."
Rainbow Dash,"That's it! I'm gonna stand out in a different way, just like you guys! Goodbye, Rainbow Crash; hello, Captain Awesome!"
Rainbow Dash,"[imitating Pinkie Pie] Good morning, everypony! Who's ready for a fantastic day of flying? I know I am! I just couldn't be more excited for the big show tomorrow. Are you guys excited? I'm excited! Actually, I'm always excited! Some ponies even call me ""Dynamic Dash""!"
Fleetfoot,"Uh, Wonderbolts don't get excited, Crash. You gotta keep a level head to fly the way we do."
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] [imitating Applejack] Well, of course I know that! But the truth of the matter is, you should be excited! It's the dream of near every little Pegasus pony to grow up and fly with the Wonderbolts! And here you all are doin' it!"
Fleetfoot,So are you.
Rainbow Dash,"[imitating Applejack] True! Go ahead and call me ""Forthright Filly"" if you want. But shee-yucks, I like to tell it like it is, and I believe a pony oughta appreciate hard work payin' off like this, because bein' a Wonderbolt is somethin' special!"
Misty Fly,We know.
Rainbow Dash,"[imitating Twilight Sparkle] You know, I was just reading about how dihedral wing angles can help increase stability in banking turns. It made me think that pre-flight checklists could really help increase our efficiency, so I went ahead and made them for everypony!"
Rainbow Dash,"[imitating Twilight Sparkle] I'm always finding so much interesting information in books. In fact, a lot of ponies call me ""Reading Rainboom""."
Spitfire,"[through loudhailer] We all know how wings work, newbie! And we already have checklists! Now get off the runway!"
Rainbow Dash,"[imitating Fluttershy] I'm so sorry. I was just trying to help because I care about all of the Wonderbolts oh-so much. Yessiree, just call me ""Care Mare"". [beat] Um, but if you're busy now, I can just come back later..."
Rainbow Dash,"[imitating Fluttershy] Or, you know, not at all..."
Rainbow Dash,"[to herself] Okay. [imitating Rarity] I must tell you how much I just love these uniforms. Why, ever since I was a foal, I've admired the mixture of bold lines and classic contours. They don't call me ""Rainbow Fash"" for nothing."
Soarin,Uhhhh... huh...?
Rainbow Dash,"[imitating Rarity] The ""Fash"" is for ""Fashion""."
Spitfire,"Crash! I'm not sure why you're acting like this, but you need to stop."
Rainbow Dash,"I was just, you know, trying to show everypony all the awesome ways I can contribute to the 'Bolts."
Spitfire,"I know you're excited to find your place on the team, but just focus on the routine for now, okay?"
Rainbow Dash,"Yes, ma'am."
Spitfire,Maybe this will help motivate you.
Rainbow Dash,Crash?! Couldn't you just put my regular name on it?!
Spitfire,"That's not how it works around here. We all have our nicknames on our jackets. Right, Clipper?"
Rainbow Dash,Clipper?
Soarin,"Right, boss!"
Rainbow Dash,"[groans] If I don't come up with something unforgettable to add to the routine, I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash for the rest of my life!"
Scootaloo,This is gonna be so amazing!
Spike,I know! I'm almost as excited as Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie,I can't wait to see Rainbow Dash's first performance as an honest-to-goodness Wonderbolt! I hope there's cotton candy!
Fluttershy,We should all remember to be extra supportive for Rainbow Dash too.
Rarity,Excellent point. It's simply dreadful that she's had such a rough start after finally achieving her dream.
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash is a pretty resilient pony. I'm sure she's shaken off her tough first day and turned it around by now!
Applejack,"Speakin' of... Hey, Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,"Perfect! Hey, can I borrow Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo,Me? What for?
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, heh, I just needed some help and figured the president of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club was the right pony for the job!"
Twilight Sparkle,I thought the Wonderbolt Reserves were here to help.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing, uh, official Reserve stuff. But don't worry! With Scootaloo's help, everything's gonna be awesome. Better than awesome!"
Rarity,Does... Does that mean practice went well yesterday?
Rainbow Dash,Gotta go.
Scootaloo,"What are we doing up here, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,"I just need a small favor from you that's really gonna make this show something special. Now, the Wonderbolts are gonna fly over this ridge right before the finale of the show. I'll fly by last, and when I signal you, you zip up the ramp on your scooter and kick the storm cloud into my path!"
Scootaloo,What?
Rainbow Dash,"That kick will shoot off a lightning bolt right behind me, making me look totally awesome! And then I'll do some incredible Rainbow Dash flying with it to create the coolest, show-stoppingest, lightning-tastic light show anypony has ever seen!"
Scootaloo,Are you sure about this?
Rainbow Dash,"Uh-huh! It's gonna be so awesome! And nopony will ever call me ""Rainbow Crash"" after this!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, gotta go! Be ready for me, okay, Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo,Um... okay...?
Announcer,"[through loudspeaker] Mares and gentlecolts, fillies and foals of all ages! Look to the skies and prepare to be awestruck by the incredible flying prowess of... the Wonderbolts!"
Fluttershy,"I hope Spike and Pinkie Pie are done getting their snacks, or they're gonna miss Rainbow Dash!"
Rarity,"Oh, don't worry, Fluttershy. Nothing would keep Pinkie Pie from missing this!"
Applejack,Heh. Except maybe cotton candy.
Spike,"Come on, Pinkie, the show's starting!"
Pinkie Pie,"One second! Just a little bit bigger please, but hurry! Bigger!"
Twilight Sparkle,That was amazing! She's doing great!
Pinkie Pie,Bigger!
Scootaloo,I hope this works.
Pinkie Pie,Hope I'm not too late. [scoffs] I dunno what took that pony so long.
Pinkie Pie,That was amazing!
Spitfire,"Way to go, Rainbow Crash."
Spitfire,"You gonna tell us what just happened, newbie?"
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I'm so sorry.
Spitfire,I should hope so. You changed the routine without consulting me and put other ponies at risk. I've drummed flyers out of the 'Bolts for less.
Rainbow Dash,"I know, and I'm ready for whatever punishment you want. You guys were right to call me ""Rainbow Crash"". I've always been a standout flyer, but since I joined the Wonderbolts, I've only stood out for making mistakes. [sighs] It's been my dream my whole life, but... I guess maybe I'm not Wonderbolt material after all."
Soarin,Are you serious?! You're the most talented flyer we've ever had!
Fleetfoot,"And you've saved all of Equestria like, a dozen times."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, I<U+0097>"
Spitfire,Of course you're supposed to be a Wonderbolt. We've been waiting for a spot to open up ever since you joined the Reserves!
Rainbow Dash,But... you guys all called me Rainbow Crash.
Soarin,"Yeah, so? My nickname's ""Clipper"". You know why they call me that?"
Rainbow Dash,Uh... 'cause you're as fast as a ship?
Soarin,Because I clipped my wing on a flagpole as I was landing on my first day. Heh.
Rainbow Dash,Huh.
Fleetfoot,"""Flatfoot"". My first day, I misjudged my landing and came down right on Spitfire's hoof."
Misty Fly,"""Dizzy""."
Surprise,"""Slowpoke""."
High Winds,"""Hoof-in-Mouth""."
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! That is so much worse than Crash.
Spitfire,Right?
Rainbow Dash,So does this mean I'm... still on the team?
Spitfire,Do you think you can be part of this team and not constantly try to showboat?
Rainbow Dash,"I promise! I spent my whole life trying to be a standout flyer, but now that I'm a Wonderbolt, it's time to be okay with fitting in!"
Spitfire,"Good, because I really didn't want to miss the chance to tease you for years about this catastrophe! I mean, that crash was epic!"
Spitfire,But you're on probation for a month. Got a problem with that?!
Rainbow Dash,"[quickly] No, ma'am."
Twilight Sparkle,Hey. Rainbow Dash. We just wanted to check on you. Are you doing okay?
Rainbow Dash,"I'm doing great, thanks!"
Scootaloo,Sure you don't need any help?
Rainbow Dash,"Nah. This mess is my responsibility, and I've gotta clean it up myself. And after this, Spitfire's got me cleaning the Wonderbolts' compound for the next month."
Scootaloo,So why are you in such a good mood?
Rainbow Dash,Duh! Because I'm a Wonderbolt!
Ponies,"Ponies' voices fill the night Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again Happy hearts so full and bright Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again Oh, what a sight Look at the light All for tonight Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again"
Fluttershy,Clouds arranged so they're just so
Pegasi,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Rainbow Dash,Gonna make some awesome snow
Pegasi,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,The chill wind blows Making a show Snowflakes aglow
Ponies,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Pinkie Pie,A day that's filled with songs to sing
Ponies,"Ding-dong, ding-dong-ding"
Applejack,Cakes and pastries we shall bring
Ponies,"Ding-dong, ding-dong-ding We're so busy making merry Windigos should all be wary"
Stallions,As our mighty voices carry
Ponies,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Rarity,Decorations we shall make
Ponies,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Rarity,Perfection you just cannot fake
Ponies,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Rarity,"Not one mistake Don't let that break Oh, goodness' sake!"
Ponies,"Hearth's Warming Eve is here once a<U+0097> Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Starlight! Ready to celebrate your first Hearth's Warming Eve here in Ponyville?"
Starlight Glimmer,I was thinking I might just skip it.
Spike,Skip Hearth's Warming Eve?!
Starlight Glimmer,"I just find it all a little silly. It's mostly a day dedicated to presents and candy, isn't it?"
Spike,And why would you deny yourself presents and candy? That's crazy talk!
Twilight Sparkle,I think what Spike means to say is Hearth's Warming is about more than presents and candy. It's a time to spend with friends and family when we celebrate a very important day in Equestria's history.
Starlight Glimmer,"I think to most ponies, it's just an excuse for silly songs and fun, not a day to remember some old story."
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe you just haven't heard the right Hearth's Warming Eve story yet!
Starlight Glimmer,"Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns sing songs around a hearth to fight back an eternal winter caused by the mythical windigos? Ha! Every foal and filly knows that story."
Twilight Sparkle,"Not that one. My favorite holiday story, ""A Hearth's Warming Tale""!"
Spike,"Oh, I love that one!"
Twilight Sparkle,"This is the story of a powerful unicorn named Snowfall Frost, who hated Hearth's Warming Eve. It all began many moons ago in Canterlot..."
Twilight Sparkle,"[narrating] Every home in Canterlot was filled with holiday spirit. Every home... except one. It was said of Snowfall that she was almost as studied as Star Swirl the Bearded. Almost, since everypony knows that Star Swirl was an expert at everything from transfiguration, dimensional calibration, teleportation<U+0097>"
Spike,[narrating] We get it. Star Swirl's awesome.
Twilight Sparkle,"[narrating] Right. The point is, Snowfall was also a powerful unicorn. She wanted to be perfect. Anything that got in the way of that was a waste of time."
Starlight Glimmer,"[gasp] Well, that batch is ruined. Snowdash!"
Twilight Sparkle,[narrating] Snowdash was Snowfall's loyal assistant.
Rainbow Dash,What do you need?
Starlight Glimmer,Get this mess cleaned up. Those foolish ponies were ringing those blasted bells outside the window and I lost my concentration!
Rainbow Dash,"[under her breath] Whoa, ponies actually enjoying Hearth's Warming Eve. Where did they get that crazy idea?"
Starlight Glimmer,Today is nothing to celebrate. Hearth's Warming Eve is a menace. A dangerous day for all of Equestria.
Rainbow Dash,"Dangerous?! It's awesome! It's the day we remember how unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos!"
Starlight Glimmer,"That silly legend is the problem! Telling everypony that ""singing songs and being nice"" will solve anything? I've spent years studying magic, and that's not how it works."
Rainbow Dash,I think you might be missing the point.
Starlight Glimmer,"Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria. That's a worthy goal for any pony. [sarcastically] But, by all means, if you want to go home early, ignore all of the work you have, and spend the rest<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,Sweet!
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh!
Starlight Glimmer,I hate Hearth's Warming Eve! All of Equestria would be better off if we just skipped the day altogether.
Starlight Glimmer,"Happy Hearth's Warming, they say in the street Happy Hearth's Warming, they think they're so sweet Words said so often that they lack any meaning Why should I join in when I could be intervening?"
Others,"Everypony loves this cursed holiday But would they be better off with it out of the way? Well, okay"
Others,"Say goodbye to the holiday With my magic, I'll erase it The greatest gift that I give today And everypony will have to face it"
Others,No more little games for you to play After you say goodbye to the holiday
Others,"Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, you had a good run Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, it's over, you're done Finally set free from your forced celebrations No need to reply to your trite invitations"
Others,"Calendar shorter by a single day Is my magic up to the test? Time to see, I can't delay"
Others,"Say goodbye to the holiday Prepare the spell, no hesitation All memory shall fade away See Equestria's new transformation"
Others,No more shall anypony say Happy Hearth's Warming... [sinister laughter] ...after today!
Others,After today...
Starlight Glimmer,"Once the spell is cast, all of Equestria will be better off, and they'll have me to thank for it!"
Starlight Glimmer,Wait a minute. Snowfall doesn't like Hearth's Warming Eve so she decides to cast a spell to get rid of it altogether? That seems a little extreme.
Twilight Sparkle,"I think what Spike is trying to say is that everypony has their reasons for doing things. Even Snowfall. And if I could continue the story, we might just find out what they are."
Spike,Proceed.
Twilight Sparkle,Snowfall was all set to cast her spell that would erase Hearth's Warming Eve for all time...
Twilight Sparkle,[narrating] ...when a voice from the hearth caught her attention.
Applejack,You sure you wanna go through with this?
Starlight Glimmer,Huh?! Who's there?!
Applejack,"The Spirit of Hearth's Warmin' Past, that's who. And you and me have got to have us a little chat."
Starlight Glimmer,A spirit?! [suspiciously] I didn't cast any spirit summoning spell. What are you doing here?
Applejack,"You don't think a spell like that would get by without some powerful forces noticin'? You've got our attention, Snowfall Frost, and we've got some pretty strong opinions on this spell of yours."
Starlight Glimmer,"""We""?"
Applejack,"They'll be along in a bit. For now, it's just you and me. Let's get a move on. We got a ton to see and barely any time to see it."
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm not going anywhere. I've got a spell to cast, and I don't need a history lesson about Hearth's Warming Eve."
Applejack,We aren't goin' to the past to learn about the holiday. We're goin' to learn about you.
Applejack,"As a young thing, life sure is somethin' You go makin' choices large and small Always growin' like a seedlin' And playin' is like dreamin' And before you know it, big and tall"
Others,And every little bitty choice you make Sends you down a path to who you are today So let's take a little trip down memory lane And see just what the past has to say
Others,"Aw, look how cute you were. Looks like you're not too upset it's Hearth's Warming Eve either."
Others,"The seeds of the past They grow pretty fast Just look at who you were back then The seeds, as they grow Look what they can show Reveal the truth time and again"
Professor Flintheart,"Just what do you think you're doing, Snowfall?"
Young Starlight Glimmer,"Decorating the classroom for Hearth's Warming Eve, Professor Flintheart!"
Professor Flintheart,"You said you wanted to learn to be a powerful unicorn, did you not?"
Young Starlight Glimmer,I do!
Professor Flintheart,And what is the way that one becomes a powerful unicorn?
Young Starlight Glimmer,"[clears throat] Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria."
Professor Flintheart,And how do these help you to learn magic?
Young Starlight Glimmer,I want to be strong enough to stop windigos and help ponies!
Professor Flintheart,That's just a story we tell little ponies. Real magic takes time to learn.
Professor Flintheart,It's your choice. Spend your time learning to become a powerful unicorn or play with your toys and make nothing of yourself.
Applejack,"Then some distress, words so careless Standin' there, you don't know what to do Feelin' helpless, you can't make it hurt less So you go and change your point of view"
Others,"And in that moment, though you didn't know it Your defenses set up walls you built to last Leading to the pony you've become today And the spell you're about to cast It all comes from your past"
Starlight Glimmer,The seeds of the past We grow up so fast Some hurts never go away
Applejack,"The seeds, as they grow This we can't let go All tied to this one holiday"
Starlight Glimmer,[gasps] Spirit? What am I supposed to<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"[reverberating] Snowfall Frost! It is I, the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Um, don't you mean ""Present"", like the time?"
Pinkie Pie,"No! Toys, Hearth's Warming doll... Here, want a cupcake?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Fine, ""Presents"". All of the pointless things ponies waste their time on."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Snowfall, it's not what the gift is that matters, it's what the gift means!"
Starlight Glimmer,It doesn't mean anything. It's just stuff!
Pinkie Pie,"Exactly! Sometimes a cupcake means ""I love you!"" Or a toy means ""Hi, how're you doing?"" Sometimes a book means ""Your mane looks amazing!"" And sometimes a scarf means... Well, a scarf usually means you look cold. That one's easy."
Starlight Glimmer,I don't understand anything you're saying.
Starlight Glimmer,What's happening to you?!
Pinkie Pie,My Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents Sense is going off! That means a song is coming on!
Pinkie Pie,"Take a look at everything around you All the smells that surely will astound you Open up your heart, it will surround you In the magic of Hearth's Warming Eve"
Others,"The little things that make it better Little ponies spreading cheer Give a toy, a hug, a sweater Memories that last all year"
Others,"The present's always filled with presents Large, medium, and small Sometimes the most important things Aren't very big at all"
Others,"What a party, there's so much to see here Can't believe you didn't want to be here You'd have had a blast, I guarantee here This is the spirit of Hearth's Warming Eve"
Others,"Cider's flowing, this is living Come on and feel the beat Life is better when you're giving Each time you do it feels so sweet"
Others,"The present's always filled with presents So come on, open your eyes Spend time with ponies just like you And watch your spirits rise"
Others,"The present's always filled with presents Take a look around The reason for the holiday Is quite easily found Yes, the reason for the holiday Is quite easily found"
Others,And the reason is to be with your friends!
Twilight Sparkle,"[singsong, as Pinkie Pie] And the reason is to be with your friends! [normal] What?"
Starlight Glimmer,"You know you're doing your Pinkie Pie voice, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,I was not!
Starlight Glimmer,"So, what happens next?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, the party was<U+0097>"
Spike,Wait! Can we take a quick break? I need to refill my cocoa.
Twilight Sparkle,[groans] Fine. But hurry up! We're almost to the best part!
Spike,"[blows] Okay, I'm ready."
Twilight Sparkle,The party was in full swing.
Rarity,Snowdash!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Merry."
Rarity,"Why, whatever is the matter, darling?"
Fluttershy,"Was it the eggnog? Oh, I knew I put in too much cinnamon!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, no, the eggnog was awesome, Flutterholly, I'm just mad at somepony who was complaining about how awful Hearth's Warming Eve is."
Rarity,"I don't suppose that pony's name starts with ""Snow""?"
Fluttershy,"And ends with ""Frost""?"
Rainbow Dash,"She said Hearth's Warming Eve is just an excuse to party, and we would all be better off spending time working to make Equestria a better place."
Rarity,What does Snowfall think a better Equestria looks like?
Rainbow Dash,"Ponies working hard, learning, and using their abilities for the benefit of Equestria."
Rarity,[muffled] It looks like we've got everything on Snowfall's list right here.
Fluttershy,I think a perfect Equestria looks a lot like a Hearth's Warming Eve party.
Starlight Glimmer,Spirit? What do you mean? What's going to happen?!
Starlight Glimmer,Who are you?
Princess Luna,I am the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Yet to Come.
Starlight Glimmer,Are you here to show me what future Hearth's Warming Eves are like?
Princess Luna,"No, for there are no more Hearth's Warming Eves for me to show."
Starlight Glimmer,Why not?
Princess Luna,"You will succeed in erasing the holiday, as you wished."
Starlight Glimmer,And what happens?
Princess Luna,I see a cold wind blowing through I see days neither fun nor free I see a future caused by you I see a path not meant to be
Others,The future should be filled with magic Dreams and wishes brought to life But the days ahead are dark and tragic No time for hope when all is strife
Others,"Whatever might have been All the dreams that ponies share Because of you, Snowfall Frost Now the future is a cold nightmare"
Starlight Glimmer,Windigos?! They aren't real! It's just a little filly's story!
Princess Luna,"They are all too real, Snowfall, and your actions will allow them to return. The future of Equestria shall be bathed in a blanket of eternal snow!"
Starlight Glimmer,There's still time!
Rarity,"Oh, my."
Fluttershy,Snowfall Frost?
Starlight Glimmer,I was hoping I wasn't too late for the party? I brought gifts.
Rainbow Dash,[spit-take] Boss?!
Starlight Glimmer,"I was wrong earlier, about Hearth's Warming Eve. It's not all about singing and presents. The singing and presents are all about celebrating the ponies in our lives. The ponies we should listen to more often: our friends."
Rainbow Dash,Wow.
Rainbow Dash,Dragon toenail? Uh... thanks?
Starlight Glimmer,I was in a hurry. I'll do better next time.
Rainbow Dash,Ha. You kidding? No one's ever given me dragon toenail before! It's awesome! Now come get some eggnog!
Twilight Sparkle,"[narrating] And from then on, it was always said of all the Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations, Snowfall's was the Hearth's Warmingest."
Twilight Sparkle,The end.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, that's it! Thanks for letting me read you the story. Guess you can call it a night. Spike and I are heading downstairs, and if you wanted to, you'd be welcome to join us."
Twilight Sparkle,"Welcome to the party! Happy Hearth's Warming, Starlight."
Starlight Glimmer,"Happy Hearth's Warming, Twilight."
Starlight Glimmer,Hearth's Warming Eve is filled with presents Some take you by surprise A story shared by your good friends That makes your spirits rise
Others,Sometimes you just let go of the past Enjoy the present while it lasts And really it's not that much to ask With good friends by your side
Others,Now it's time to celebrate
Ponies,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Starlight Glimmer,"All together, feeling great"
Ponies,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Starlight Glimmer,Can hardly wait We'll party 'til late Our favorite date
Ponies,"Hearth's Warming Eve is here once a<U+0097> Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!"
Rainbow Dash,"[panting] Come on! If we hurry, we can get there before the paper's even delivered to Rarity's house!"
Pinkie Pie,Maybe she won't read the article.
Applejack,I'm pretty sure Rarity's gonna read a review of her new boutique in Manehattan.
Rainbow Dash,I still can't believe we all just blabbed everything that happened to that reporter!
Fluttershy,I just hope it doesn't end up being an article about how her friends almost ruined the opening.
Twilight Sparkle,"I think you're all overreacting. Rarity's our friend. If anypony is gonna understand, it'll be her."
Rarity,[grimly] I was wondering when all of you were going to show up.
Rarity,[excitedly] Now we can all read the review together!
Rainbow Dash,"Um, I have an idea. How 'bout we don't read it?"
Twilight Sparkle,"What she means is, before you read it, we should probably tell you about<U+0097>"
Rarity,"No, no, darling. Please, no spoilers."
Fluttershy,But<U+0097>
Rarity,No spoilers!
Rarity,"Now, is everypony ready to hear what I'm sure is a stellar review that describes in stunning detail exactly how each of you contributed to the successful opening of Rarity For You?"
Rarity,"[clears throat, reading] ""Many a pony has tried their hoof at joining the ranks of the elite fashion trendsetters currently ensconced in the boutiques of Manehattan's famed Saddle Row."" [giggles, continues reading] ""Some might say it's the ultimate achievement in Equestrian fashion, and never before has a reporter been granted such unfettered behind-the-scenes access until now!"""
Fluttershy,I wish it had been more fettered.
Rarity,"Oh, uh... [mutters] Ah! [reading] ""I sat down with..."" [giggles, continues reading] ""...Rarity and her friends after the opening to get the inside scoop, and what a scoop it was!"""
Buried Lede,"Okay, kid, ya successfully opened a shop in Manehattan and that's no mean feat! Most ponies might wonder what it feels like. Here's how it's gonna be: I'm gonna interview you and your friends so I can paint a picture of how it all came together. A word picture, mind you, not an actual picture. Any questions?"
Rarity,"Well, I was wondering<U+0097>"
Buried Lede,"Let's get started! Ms. Rarity, you've got shops all over Equestria, but this was your first time trying to make it in the big city. What made ya think you could tackle it on your own?"
Rarity,"Well, I wouldn't say all over Equestria. I just have two other boutiques: one in my hometown of Ponyville, and one in Canterlot. Uh, still, when I decided to open this one, I was nothing but confident."
Twilight Sparkle,"Let's just say that if I could choose, I probably wouldn't do it that way again. Heh."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, it wasn't the funnest party ever..."
Applejack,"It was a plum-puckered, pig-pushin' disaster!"
Rainbow Dash,"After a lifetime of awesome, I think everypony's allowed to mess up every now and then, right?"
Rainbow Dash,"Wait, are you writing this down?"
Fluttershy,"Um, it didn't go exactly how I thought it would, but it, um, started out all right."
Rarity,"Welcome to Saddle Row, an entire street lined with the most fashionable boutiques in all of Equestria!"
Applejack,"If it's supposed to be the most fashionable block of shops, where's Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium?"
Rarity,I suppose it didn't make the cut. [gasps] Here it is! Rarity For You!
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, it's lovely. But are you sure you'll be ready to open tonight?"
Rarity,"No need to fret over a mere moderate amount of preparation. My clothes arrive soon, my sales associate after that, and with a little... dusting, we'll be ready for the grand opening tonight."
Rarity,"Mr. Stripes owns the building. He's a very pleasant landlord. Although he can be pushy at times. [beat] Okay, all the time."
Mr. Stripes,"Mr. You've met my daughter, the apple of my ear, the hay in my hoof? You will let her work with you."
Rarity,"[chuckles nervously] It's just, I'm dreadfully busy preparing for tonight's grand opening, as you can see."
Mr. Stripes,Mr. There are only two things I love more than being pushy. One is my daughter. The other is miniature doll furniture. And I would sell my entire mini-furniture collection to make my daughter happy. You understand?
Rarity,I'm sorry. I just don't think it's going to be possible.
Mr. Stripes,Mr. Let me say another way... Hire her or I raise rent until you no can afford!
Rarity,"Oh, uh, welcome aboard."
Plaid Stripes,"[loudly] First idea! Instead of clothes, we sell glow-in-the-dark teeth! Like this. [chomp, chomp] But they glow in the dark!"
Rarity,Glow-in-the-dark teeth! What was she thinking?!
Rarity,"Aah! Fluttershy, your assistance is required in the stock room, posthaste!"
Fluttershy,"Aw, hello."
Rarity,But what are they doing here?
Fluttershy,"Smoky made too much noise eating garbage, so Softpad's mother made them move out of the trashcan."
Fluttershy,"Then Smoky Jr. found a nice home in the crawl space behind the building. But Mr. Stripes demolished it, so they were temporarily camped out in the back until they found a new place to live."
Rarity,"No, no, no! I can't have a family of rubbish-scented raccoons living in my boutique!"
Rarity,"Uh, did you hear that?"
Rarity,[annoyed] Heh. Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs.
Pinkie Pie,[excitedly] Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs!
Rarity,"I'm sorry. Could you please ask her to turn it down? Could you ask her to turn it down, please? [pleading] Turn it down, please! [sobbing] Oh, please!"
Rarity,"Ugh! Foals today listen to their so-called ""music"" far too loud. I realize that makes me sound like an old mare. But this is business!"
Rainbow Dash,I wish we were having as much fun as they are.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, sweeping can be fun, too. [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep. Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep..."
Rainbow Dash,"Only Twilight could make a dance remix about sweeping. I mean, how lame is that?"
Applejack,Yeah. It wasn't even catchy.
Rainbow Dash,Nope.
Twilight Sparkle,"[to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep..."
Others,"Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep..."
Rarity,"Apparently, DJ Pon-3 has a residency at the Party Palace upstairs, but security won't let me speak to her."
Rarity,Aah! What in the name of Celestia was that?!
Plaid Stripes,"You know how most stores have a little jingle-bell when the door opens? Ahem. I thought we should have something with a little more pizzazz! So, I installed one of Daddy's antique horns."
Rarity,"[sighs] We'll have to do something about that, after I think of a way to quiet down that music. And after I finish designing the window display!"
Rarity,"Gesundheit! Oh, Miss Pommel! I'm so glad to see you! Now, as the sole sales associate at Rarity For You, I hate to add to your already overflowing plate of responsibilities, but it looks as though we have just a tad more to do before tonight than I thought."
Coco Pommel,"Actually, I<U+0097> [sneezes] I can't work tonight."
Rarity,Oh? Why not?
Rarity,"Feel better, my sweet. We'll manage without you... somehow. And we'll manage glowing teeth and car horns and disorganized clothes and dance music! Am I forgetting anything?"
Rarity,[sobbing] What am I going to do?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, opening a store in Manehattan is a pretty big deal. It's natural that Rarity would be a little stressed about how it was going. Since it wasn't going well. Still, I think she handled it all right."
Rarity,"My dream is doomed! Doomed, I tell you! Doomed!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I know things haven't gone perfectly so far, but we've done this kind of thing before. If we all work together<U+0097>"
Rarity,"I appreciate the offer, but this is Manehattan. To make it in the fashion scene here, everything has to be perfect. The perfect location! The perfect clothes! The perfect opening!"
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe we should just postpone.
Rarity,"Postpone?! Darling, tonight is the last night of the fall season. If we don't open tonight, it won't be..."
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Perfect.
Rarity,"Yes. I know what needs to be done. I just need more of me! Oh, how I wish I could make copies of myself!"
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah... Making copies of yourself always sounds like a great idea, but before you know it, you're locked in a room with fifty Pinkie Pies watching paint dry."
Twilight Sparkle,We can do this. And we can stay true to your vision.
Rarity,"You'd do that? Fluttershy, you'll handle those... strong-smelling raccoons for me?"
Fluttershy,Of course.
Applejack,"Leave Plaid Stripes to me. I'll handle her and her, uh, ""good ideas""."
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, ooh, ooh! And I can go upstairs to that nonstop party and have tons of fun and eat some cake and set off party cannons and<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,And then make them be quiet.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm pretty sure I know somepony who wouldn't mind organizing this merchandise shipment for you. [beat] I'm talking about myself. [beat] [pleading] Oh, please, let me organize it!"
Rarity,"This all sounds splendid, but I don't even have a single employee, and I'll need the best of the best."
Rainbow Dash,Leave the hiring to me.
Rarity,"Oh! This is it, my dears. If you can handle these problems, I'll focus on the designs for the front window display. We'll show Manehattan what Rarity For You is all about! Oh, what would I do without you?"
Rainbow Dash,"What would she do without us? Huh. Lemme think. [imitating Rarity] ""Darlings, I'm absolutely doomed, doomed, doomed!"" [laughs, normal voice] Heh, I sound just like her!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, you're not writing this down, are you?"
Rarity,Now for the perfect window display. Hmm.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, I can't really stop a super fun party in the middle of mega-happy fun times, can I?! Oh, what would Rarity want?!"
Rarity Devil,Keep that party going 'til the break of dawn!
Pinkie Pie,Really?
Rarity Angel,"Indubitably! And as for the roof, get jiggy! Raise it, Pinkie! Raise it like you've never raised it before!"
Pinkie Pie,Oh! If you say so!
Rarity Devil,"Oh, please, Pinkie Pie. Never in a million years would I say such balderdash!"
Pinkie Pie,Oh.
Pinkie Pie,"Obviously, DJ Pon-3 only plays the sickest of beats. I just wouldn't want her to miss out on the coolest new music straight from the back-alley underground, zip-zap party scene! [to DJ Pon-3] I'd play the whole thing if I were you, no matter what other ponies think."
Dancers,Awww.
Rainbow Dash,"Rarity For You is only hiring the best of the best. And to me, that means the fastest. Now, uh, before we begin, uh... [to herself] Am I doing this right? What would Rarity want? [to applicants] New plan!"
Rainbow Dash,Who can be the first one to tell me what fabric this is?
Blue Bobbin,That's organza.
Rainbow Dash,Are you sure?
Blue Bobbin,"It's a thin, plain weave. Sheer fabric traditionally made from silk, so... yeah."
Rainbow Dash,I don't know the first thing about clothes. Pretty much all I can do is look at something and tell you if it's clothes or not. This chair? Not clothes.
Plaid Stripes,See if you can keep up with me here. What are all clothes made of?
Applejack,"Uh, fabric?"
Plaid Stripes,Bingo! But not in this store. Uh-uh. Not anymore.
Applejack,"Oh, no?"
Plaid Stripes,"Two words for you: ""spoon clothes"". All our clothes will be made of spoons!"
Applejack,"[sighs, to herself] What would Rarity want? [to Plaid Stripes] You know, I like you, Plaid Stripes. If it were up to me, we'd have a spoon clothes store right next to Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium. But it ain't up to me, so the answer is no."
Applejack,"Personally, I think spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea. Useful, too. Eatin' soup, stirrin' gumbo, diggin' little holes."
Twilight Sparkle,"There. Perfect. Although, what would Rarity want? Maybe she wouldn't like it done by color. Guess I have to start over!"
Rarity,"A window display is the first thing customers see, and if they like it, they'll walk inside and experience the glory that is my boutique."
Rainbow Dash,[stammers] I don't know which one of you to hire! Just... keep guessing fabrics!
Plaid Stripes,"Daddy, Rarity's friend doesn't like my ideas!"
Mr. Stripes,Mr. Spoon clothes is good idea!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, no! Not a shopping music mashup!"
Fluttershy,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
Rarity,How's it<U+0097>
Rarity,Ooh!
Rarity,Hello? The door appears to be stuck!
Twilight Sparkle,Yep. We're workin' on it!
Rarity,"Hmm. Well, shouldn't let this time go to waste."
Twilight Sparkle,How did this happen?
Pinkie Pie,I shut down the party.
Applejack,I told Plaid Stripes no.
Fluttershy,I asked the raccoons to leave.
Rainbow Dash,I asked a lot of fabric questions.
Others,"Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Just like I thought Rarity would want!"
Twilight Sparkle,Rarity asked us to help her with everything because she knows all of us so well. [to Fluttershy] She knows how much you care for animals. She'd trust you to solve the problem your way. [to the others] Maybe we should all do the same. Doing this our way is what Rarity wants. It's not too late. Let's all dig in and we can fix this.
Twilight Sparkle,Before Rarity finds out how bad we messed up.
Fluttershy,I'm sorry I asked you to leave. The place is yours if you wanna stay. Though I would like to ask you all just one favor.
Pinkie Pie,"I'm sorry I made you play that un-fun, super-boring music. But if you're up for it, I have an idea to make the party even better!"
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, I don't get fabric, but I do get speed. And I need somepony fast enough to help all the customers Rarity's gonna have. So... first one to the river and back gets the job! [beat] It's a race! Go!"
Applejack,"[clears throat] Mr. Stripes, I owe your daughter an apology. She's got good ideas, and I should give 'em a chance. So here's what I'm thinkin'."
Rarity,Perfect!
Twilight Sparkle,"[awkwardly] Wow, looks like we fixed that door just in time!"
Rarity,[gasps] Oh! What's all this?
Twilight Sparkle,"The whole place organized by style, cross-referenced by size, and reverse-indexed by fabric. She'll be able to find anything in three seconds flat! It was some of my best work."
Rarity,Oh! I knew I could count on you! All right... I suppose this is the moment of truth...
Rarity,Rarity For You is now open!
Rarity,"Oh, dear. I wasn't quite prepared for such a crowd. How will I handle them all?"
Blue Bobbin,My name's Blue Bobbin. I'll be your personal shopping assistant this evening.
Rainbow Dash,"Right this way, everypony, and one of our talented salesponies can help you out!"
Rainbow Dash,"Honestly, they were all pretty slow. But they finished the race. Plus they knew a lot more about fabric than I did. So, I hired them all!"
Pinkie Pie,"The way I see it, Rarity designs fashion, DJ Pon-3 designs beats. What better combination than a boutique/dance club?"
Fluttershy,"After a quick bath, they were more than willing to help!"
Others,"""Waxton"": Ah, a blue corn reduction with shallot confit! But how can I possibly enjoy it without a<U+0097>"
Plaid Stripes,Spoon?
Applejack,Heh. Toldja spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea.
Others,"""Waxton"": [sips] Mmm! Exquisite! This is the most whimsical and wonderfully fashionable boutique I've ever seen!"
Rarity,"[reading] ""In the end, Rarity's grand opening was a smashing success! True, it got off to a rocky start, but somehow this rag-tag group of ne'er-do-wells..."" [to ponies] Oh, heavens, I think he means you. [continues reading] ""...came together and created the perfect boutique. A vision of Rarity combined with the expertise of her friends! This reporter, for one, is a believer."" [to ponies] Why didn't you tell me there were so many problems?"
Twilight Sparkle,We all figured you had enough on your mind.
Applejack,And we didn't want you to think that the opening wasn't perfect.
Rarity,"[giggles] ""Ne'er-do-wells"" or not, I know I can always count on all of you. And nothing could be more perfect than that."
Aloe,"Um... Miss Rarity? Eh, how much longer are you planning to stay in here, darling?"
Rarity,"Oh, dear. Is somepony else waiting?"
Aloe,"Oh, no, no. I just don't want you to get all... What is word? Pruney."
Rarity,"Oh. Uh, well, I'm just waiting for Applejack. It's been so long since we've had a relaxing day at the spa together. I'm quite certain she'll be along any moment."
Applejack,"Hey, there, Rarity. I really tried to get here earlier. I just can't believe how much time my chores are takin' up these days. At least now we'll finally get to spend some quality spa time together. Right?"
Aloe,"Okay, fillies, that's it. We are closing up for the day."
Applejack,"Aw, shucks, Rarity. I guess I missed the whole day. I sure am sorry."
Rarity,"Me, too."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hi, Rarity!"
Rarity,"Morning, Twilight, Spike. Good heavens, that's a lot of empty pie plates."
Spike,Uh... yeah. We were just heading to pick up some fresh pies. Heh. I don't know why we keep running out at the castle. [nervous laugh] What are you gonna get?
Rarity,"Applejack, actually. Although, I'm quite sure she'll be too busy once again."
Twilight Sparkle,What do you mean?
Rarity,"Oh, nothing. It's just that Applejack and I haven't had one of our spa days in ages."
Twilight Sparkle,You two really should set aside some time.
Rarity,"Darling, I have been trying for moons! But Applejack is so busy these days, it's next to impossible."
Twilight Sparkle,Wow. I didn't realize Applejack had so much to do.
Spike,"Hey, Applejack! Another order of pies, please."
Applejack,"Sure thing, Spike!"
Spike,Aah! Dah! Whoa-oa-oa!
Rarity,I don't suppose those pies are the last chore on the schedule for today?
Applejack,"Gah! Land's sakes! Is it time for our spa day already? Rarity, why don't you go on ahead and I'll meet ya there?"
Rarity,"Oh! Please, Applejack, let's not kid ourselves!"
Applejack,"Well, it ain't 'cause I don't wanna. But the work on the farm has just been takin' up more and more of my time."
Twilight Sparkle,I hate seeing you two not spending time together. Can't you get somepony else in your family to take over for a bit?
Applejack,"[sighs] Wish I could. But Granny, Big Mac, and Apple Bloom all have chores of their own. And today, they're all busy takin' the harvest to market."
Twilight Sparkle,"I know we're not farmers, but I'm sure Spike and I could handle things for a little while."
Applejack,Maybe...
Twilight Sparkle,Is there one chore we could do?
Applejack,"Well... I suppose if you two got started on feedin' the pigs, I could maybe leave for an hour."
Rarity,Oooh! An hour of spa perfection? I can work with that!
Twilight Sparkle,"Perfect! You head out to the spa, and Spike and I'll take care of things here."
Spike,Whoa! Dah! Whoa!
Spike,"Uh, yeah. We totally got everything covered."
Applejack,"[sighs] Okay. This list pretty much covers everything you need to know to feed the pigs. But, uh, maybe I should go over it with you just to..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, please. If there's a list involved, I am one hundred percent on top of it."
Applejack,"Uh, right."
Twilight Sparkle,"And don't worry about things here! Spike and I have totally got this! I mean, it's just feeding the pigs. How hard could it be?"
Spike,"Uh, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,Whoa.
Applejack,"I'm glad we're doin' this, Rarity. I've been puttin' work before our spa time for too long. I know we've only got an hour, but I can't wait to have a steam."
Rarity,"A steam is just the start. I know exactly what we'll do, and an hour will be perfect."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, Spike, ready with that list?"
Spike,Ready.
Twilight Sparkle,Let's do this!
Spike,"[reading] ""Step one: open the gate."""
Spike,"Okay. [reading] ""Step two: close the gate."""
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Spike,Mm. That's what it says.
Spike,"[reading] ""Step three: walk away."""
Twilight Sparkle,"""Walk away""? Really?"
Spike,"[intonation of ""I don't know""] Mmm."
Applejack,I just hope Twilight and Spike can handle things until I get back.
Rarity,"Now, Applejack, if we are really to enjoy this time together, you simply must give yourself over to the idea that you are off-duty and try to relax."
Applejack,"I know. You're right. I really am glad we're doin' this. And as long as it's only an hour, I'm sure everythin' will be just fine."
Rarity,Exactly. Now kindly step this way. Relaxation awaits.
Rarity,[gasps] Rainbow Dash! What are you doing here?!
Applejack,Yeah. I didn't think spa treatments were your thing exactly.
Rainbow Dash,What?!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, they're totally not. At least, not the froufrou kind."
Rarity,Ah.
Applejack,Huh.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I, uh, I think I tweaked something at Wonderbolts practice the other day. I just came in for a deep tissue sports massage."
Others,"""Lavender Essence"": Ah, Miss Dash, I am so sorry, but we are running just a tad behind, and we are not quite ready to start your pampered muscle massage and indulgent hooficure just yet."
Rainbow Dash,Oh! [chuckles nervously] I-I'm pretty sure that wasn't what I signed up for.
Others,"""Lavender Essence"": But they are your usual."
Rainbow Dash,"And it seems like you're really busy today anyway! I'll just come back tomorrow. [to Rarity and Applejack] Uh, see you two later! Have fun! [to Lavender Essence, whispered] But put me down for the same thing."
Applejack,"[chuckles] Too bad Rainbow Dash just hates those ""froufrou"" spa treatments. She could have joined us for a nice steam. Hoo-wee! I can't wait."
Rarity,"[laughs] Indeed. Although, if they couldn't fit Dashie in, I wonder just how far behind things are running. Obviously, we're on a very tight schedule."
Rarity,"[grunts, gasps] Well, maybe not everypony is waiting for the steam room."
Caramel,"Oh, no. No, that's exactly what we're waiting for. Oh, I hope you're not in a hurry."
Applejack,So everypony here wants a steam bath?
Rarity,"Well, the solution is obvious. We'll simply have to start our short time at the spa with something else."
Applejack,"[scoffs] Nothin' doin'. I came here to have a steam, and that's just what I'm gonna get!"
Rarity,"But, but, it'll take most of our hour just to get through this line!"
Aloe,"RRRRarity! My favorite customer! Mwah! Mwah! And Appleyack? Well, it certainly has been a long time since you two were here together! So lovely to have you back."
Rarity,"Well, I wish I could say the same."
Aloe,"Yes, the wait time for the steam room certainly has been getting worse lately. But I'm sure we'll be able to accommodate your usual treatments."
Applejack,Not without my steam!
Rarity,"Apparently, Applejack won't consider starting her time at the spa without a steam, and we only have an hour."
Aloe,That is a problem.
Rarity,"Applejack, where are you going?"
Applejack,"Um, why are y'all just standin' here?"
Buddy,Ugh! Just waiting for the steam to build up.
Spoiled Rich,"Without steam, a steam room's just a room, and I've got plenty of those at home. Because I live in a mansion."
Aloe,"It has been taking longer for the steam to reach the Ponyville Day Spa quality. We even had to add a warm towel service. So sorry for the delay, everypony. Please help yourselves."
Applejack,"So if you're not gettin' enough steam, that must mean there's not enough hot water."
Rarity,"Ooh, Applejack, honestly, can't we just start with a hooficure? We're going to run out of time."
Applejack,Hmm.
Applejack,Ha! Now what do we have here?
Rarity,"The laundry room, of course. And at this point, I'm considering soaking my hooves in one of the machines so my time here isn't a total loss!"
Aloe,"The Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on sanitary conditions, and fresh linens are integral part."
Applejack,"Well, sure, but have you always run every single one of these here machines full bore all day, every day?"
Others,"""Birch Bucket"": The answer is no. But ponies sure do love the warm towel service."
Applejack,Hmmm.
Others,"""Birch Bucket"": Eh, you are all wanting towel?"
Applejack,Looks to me like you don't have any left.
Others,"""Birch Bucket"": Well, like I said, warm towels are big hit."
Applejack,"I think I figured out the problem. You've got a small leak, and that means the steam takes just a little longer to build up. And while ponies wait, they get cold. Cold ponies start wrappin' themselves in towels, and all those dirty towels have to be cleaned because Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on cleanliness."
Others,"""Birch Bucket"": Eh, what?"
Applejack,"Basically, losin' steam makes you use more towels. That means you do more laundry, which uses up the hot water you need to make more steam, so the problem just keeps gettin' worse."
Aloe,Ah! I had no idea.
Rarity,"Wonderful. Now that we've solved the great steam mystery, we can finally get back to our... significantly less than an hour of relaxation."
Applejack,"Rarity, are you kiddin'? I can't just leave things like this. I'm gonna need my tools."
Rarity,Ahh!
Applejack,"Whew! Now that that leak's fixed, ponies won't get so cold they use up all those towels! And without all that laundry, there'll be plenty of hot water for all the steam anypony could want!"
Others,"""Birch Bucket"": And I only have to be doing vash once a day!"
Aloe,"Wow, Appleyack! Have you ever considered a career in the spa industry? I'm sure I can find something for you."
Applejack,"[laughs] No, thanks. I'm just relieved I can finally relax in the steam. What do you say, Rarity?"
Rarity,"It sounds lovely, Applejack, but... unfortunately, you spent so much time fixing the steam room, we don't have any time left to use it. Honestly, how in Equestria did it never occur to you to check for leaks?"
Aloe,"There's just so many other things to worry about! I suppose ve get used to the way things are, and ve don't realize there vas problem."
Rarity,You obviously need an outside eye to evaluate the situation. It's lucky for you Applejack is too stubborn to relax!
Applejack,"Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity. We'll just have to do this another day. Twilight and Spike should be done feedin' the pigs by now."
Rarity,Twilight is a very capable pony. I'm sure she can figure out what to do next.
Applejack,"Look, I know Twilight's a princess and an Alicorn, but she isn't a farmer. I've been doin' farm work my whole life, and I'm not sure it's somethin' you can just ""figure out""."
Rarity,"Of course. [gasps] Why don't we pop back so you could explain to Twilight what to do next, and then we'll come back here and pick up where we left off?"
Applejack,"Well, I suppose I could try... assumin' everythin' went well so far."
Rarity,"[laughing] Oh, Applejack, honestly! How could it not?"
Spike,Wouldn't it be easier to just fly?
Applejack,"I'm sorry, Rarity, but I think I'm gonna have to finish these chores myself."
Rarity,"Twilight, darling! How in the world did you end up there?"
Twilight Sparkle,Spike and I were just trying to follow Applejack's list as closely as possible.
Spike,Mmmh... Maybe not the best plan.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Applejack, but we never even got started feeding the pigs."
Applejack,"That's alright, Twilight. I know you did your best. I guess a list can't really capture all the ways I have of doin' things."
Twilight Sparkle,At least you two got to spend some time at the spa together.
Spike,"Yeah, that must've been super relaxing!"
Rarity,"Well, if watching Applejack fix plumbing counts as relaxing, then yes."
Twilight Sparkle,What about your hour of spa perfection?
Rarity,"As it turns out, the Ponyville Day Spa had a few problems with their steam room, and somepony refused to relax until she had fixed them."
Applejack,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute puttin' up with problems they didn't even know they had! Somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'. An' I took one good look at that spa jam, and I knew I had to do somethin'! Sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation. [babbles] Whether it's a leaky pipe or doin' too much laundry. You can't just stick to the same old way of doin' things and expect them to get better. [clucking] I mean, thinkin' you can is just plumb ridiculous. Right? [short laugh] It's funny when you realize the extra work they were doin' was actually makin' things worse!"
Applejack,"I mean, I guess it's possible to get stuck in a routine where you're doin' all this extra stuff and not realize it, but I can't for the life of me think of how! [beat] Why are y'all starin' at me like that?"
Rarity,Um... Are you certain everything you just did is entirely necessary to feed the pigs?
Applejack,"What? Of course! Why would I be doin' it if it weren't? See, this gate here used to squeak so loud, the pigs would run to the other side of the pen and never come out! So I open and close it to let them know it's safe."
Twilight Sparkle,But it doesn't squeak anymore.
Applejack,Of course not! I fixed that ages ago. Then I realized puttin' a little fright into 'em got 'em all hustlin' out of the pen.
Spike,They don't look scared to me.
Applejack,"Well, no. They got used to it. Which is why I started doin' the chicken dance! To show 'em that if they didn't get to eatin' their food, the chickens would. 'Course, bein' a chicken, I couldn't very well open the gate. Gettin' the food bucket to spill into the trough was just a happy accident because one time I left it there by mistake."
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, Applejack? It seems like everything you're doing is to fix things that aren't really problems anymore."
Applejack,"Well, I'll be..."
Rarity,Hmmm... Maybe it isn't so hard to get stuck doing extra work after all.
Applejack,Huh. I wonder if I've been doin' that around here with anythin' else.
Rarity,"Well, there's only one way to find out!"
Applejack,"[sighs] Thanks, y'all. I guess I just got so used to doin' everythin' a certain way, I didn't realize there were any problems."
Twilight Sparkle,Having a friend look at what you're doing with an outside eye can really help!
Rarity,"Mm-hmm! And I suppose if it weren't for our unsuccessful time at the spa, none of us would've realized it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, now that your chores are streamlined, what are you gonna do with all the extra time?"
Applejack,I think I have a few ideas.
Applejack,[sighs] Think you can come up with enough things for us to do now that we have more time to relax?
Rarity,"Oh, please. I could plan a week's worth of treatments!"
Applejack,"Heh. Well, let's just start with the rest of the day for now. After all the work we just did on the farm, I am ready for some serious relaxation!"
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Thanks for letting me know there was an opening. I don't know if I could make it without my pampered muscle massage.
Aloe,Don't vorry about it. Shall I put you down for another one tomorrow?
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, absolutely! Sometimes a girl just has to pamper herself, am I right?"
Rarity,You certainly are!
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps] [stammering] Oh! Hey! I was just, uh, uh..."
Rarity,"[giggles] Don't worry, Rainbow Dash. We were just heading in for some pampering ourselves. You could always join us."
Applejack,"That is, if you don't mind sufferin' through one or two ""froufrou"" treatments."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh... I suppose I could take it. You know, for you ponies."
Mrs. Shy,"Mrs. We're so happy you could come have lunch with your father and me, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,I'm so glad you asked.
Rainbow Dash,"And it was super awesome of you to invite me too! Things have been so busy with the Wonderbolts lately, it's great to get a chance to relax someplace quiet."
Mr. Shy,"Mr. That's exactly what I intend to do now that I've retired. In fact, I converted the back house to showcase my cloud collection. I have my clouds, your mom has her flowers, you've got your animals, and your brother..."
Mrs. Shy,Mrs. He's matured a lot since then.
Mr. Shy,"Mr. Actually, it's funny you bring Zephyr up..."
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! Not again!"
Mrs. Shy,"Mrs. It's just for a little while, dear. 'Til he gets back on his hooves."
Rainbow Dash,"Wait, you don't mean<U+0097>!"
Zephyr Breeze,"Guess who's home! That's right, big sis, it's your one and only favorite little brother, moi."
Zephyr Breeze,"Hi, Flutterbutter! How's the bestest big sister ever? Hey, where's the love? How about a little excitement to see your baby brother?"
Fluttershy,"I'm just surprised. When you left, you said mane therapy was your calling."
Zephyr Breeze,"Oh, it is, sis, it is. You would not believe how much stress ponies hold in their manes. Everything gets limp and unmanageable. No offense, but brushing alone won't solve the problem."
Fluttershy,What went wrong?
Zephyr Breeze,"Nothing went wrong, per se. It's just the powers that be were so locked into their required styles, and you know me. I've got my own style! And I think they were a little threatened."
Mrs. Shy,"Mrs. O-Oh, this is... lovely, dear."
Rainbow Dash,Ugh.
Zephyr Breeze,"Welllll, if it ain't Rainbows ""The Best Flyer There Ever Was"" Dash!"
Rainbow Dash,"[flatly] Oh, this ought to be good."
Zephyr Breeze,"Sorry, I shouldn't tease you. I know the whole super awesome flyer bit's just to impress me."
Zephyr Breeze,"Still, thanks for showing up for my homecoming. It's, it's sweet."
Zephyr Breeze,"I kinda thought there'd be more ponies here. I mean, what about your party planner friend, um... Sprinkle Pie! She could've turned this into a real house partay, am I right? I mean, this place could use it. [singsong] Drab!"
Mrs. Shy,"Mrs. Heh. I-I, eh..."
Mr. Shy,Mr. We have been meaning to redecorate...
Zephyr Breeze,"Dad, please. When I get all my stuff back in here, you won't even remember what this boring old place looked like!"
Fluttershy,"[whispering] Um, Mom, Dad, can I talk to you for a second?"
Mrs. Shy,"Mrs. [sighs] What is it, honey?"
Fluttershy,"I'm not so sure letting Zephyr move back home is a good idea. I know you both want to help, but don't you remember last time?"
Mrs. Shy,"Mrs. Zephyr's just trying to find his place, dear."
Fluttershy,[sighs] I know. It just seems like his place always ends up being your place. And then he sort of makes you do everything for him!
Mr. Shy,"Mr. Well, we may not be as bold as you, Fluttershy, but don't you worry. We know how to stand up for ourselves."
Zephyr Breeze,"And they were all like, ""We love your free spirit, Zeph! And it would be wrong to cage that! Go follow your dreams!"""
Rainbow Dash,Zeph was just telling me all about the ins and outs of mane therapy school.
Zephyr Breeze,It's all so political. I just could not take it!
Fluttershy,"Well, maybe if you stuck with it for more than a few weeks..."
Zephyr Breeze,"Sorry, sis, but when something's not the right fit, this pony's gotta fly!"
Zephyr Breeze,"[yawns] Anyway, good talk, Rainbows. I am so touched you came to see me, really. I hate to deprive you of my presence, but this breeze needs his Z's."
Rainbow Dash,"You know it's the middle of the day, right?"
Zephyr Breeze,"I know. [maracas in background] Siesta! I'm just gonna assume you made up my room the way I like it, right, Mom? Oh, I almost forgot! All my stuff is out front. Wanna grab that for me, Pops? [short laugh] Thanks."
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Same old Zeph.
Rainbow Dash,"I know you weren't expecting to see your brother, but you've been kind of quiet, even for you."
Fluttershy,"I'm sorry, but I am just so... so... peeved right now! [gasps] Excuse my language!"
Pinkie Pie,"Rainbow Dash! Fluttershy! It's me, Pinkie Pie! Your friend!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, um, sorry about that."
Rainbow Dash,"We just had lunch with Fluttershy's parents, and you'll never guess who showed up."
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! Mayor Mare? Cranky Doodle Donkey? Cheese Sandwich? Ms. Harshwhinny?!
Rainbow Dash,Zephyr Breeze.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, that makes more sense."
Applejack,"And from the look on your face, I'm guessin' it's for another one of his ""extended stays""?"
Rainbow Dash,She's a bit peeved.
Fluttershy,"Zephyr's my brother, and I love him. But he's never learned to do anything for himself. I don't know why my parents keep letting him trot all over them!"
Applejack,"Well, if your parents won't stand up for themselves, maybe you need to stand up for them."
Fluttershy,"You know, you're right!"
Fluttershy,Zephyr Breeze!
Zephyr Breeze,"Oh, hey, sis. Come to see me work my magic and turn this place from drab to fab, huh? Well, watch and learn!"
Fluttershy,Can't you see what you're doing?!
Zephyr Breeze,Yeah! I'm getting rid of this old stuff so I can turn the backhouse into my art studio! I've decided I'm gonna be a sculptor!
Fluttershy,I'm talking about Mom's flowers!
Zephyr Breeze,"She's gonna move them so I can have my meditation patio here. She loves replanting stuff. Don't you, Mom?"
Fluttershy,And Dad's been collecting his favorite bits of cloud from the factory since before you were born.
Mr. Shy,Mr. The very best from every production run since my first day on the job. Ah!
Mr. Shy,Mr. [sighs] But why hold onto the past really?
Fluttershy,You can't just fly in and change everything Mom and Dad have built here.
Zephyr Breeze,But this is the only place big enough for my studio/meditation garden. Ooh! Unless I do it in the living room!
Fluttershy,"[to her parents] I know speaking up for yourself can be hard, believe me, but Zephyr will never stand on his own if he can lean on you."
Zephyr Breeze,"Don't be so dramatic, sis! Mom and Dad just wanna let me be me! Right? I can do plenty on my own."
Fluttershy,I agree. Which is why you should move out.
Zephyr Breeze,"Oh. Well... I mean, I-I totally would, but... I don't think that's what Mom and Dad want! It's not, is it?"
Mrs. Shy,Mrs. Ehhh...
Mr. Shy,"Mr. You know we love you, son, but your sister has a point."
Zephyr Breeze,"[tearing up] Sure. I mean, I really just came back here to keep you guys company, but... whatever's best for the family. I just... I just gotta grab a few essentials."
Mrs. Shy,Mrs. And... y-you definitely have somewhere else to go?
Zephyr Breeze,Of course! There's plenty of ponies who'd love for a little breeze to blow their way...
Rainbow Dash,So... where's Zeph gonna go now?
Fluttershy,"I'm not sure. Oh, I hope I did the right thing..."
Rainbow Dash,Are you kidding? One hundred percent!
Zephyr Breeze,"[singsong] Hey, sis!"
Zephyr Breeze,Your new roomie's here!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, maybe like seventy percent."
Fluttershy,"Um, Zephyr. When Mom and Dad told you to find someplace else to live, I don't think they meant here."
Zephyr Breeze,"Well, it's not their house, so by definition, it's someplace else. Am I right, Rainbows? Stop oogling me and help settle this."
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] You know what? I totally forgot that I promised to help Pinkie Pie... sprinkle... something.
Fluttershy,You said you had plenty of places to go!
Zephyr Breeze,Ehhhh...
Fluttershy,[sighs] Fine. You can stay here<U+0097>
Zephyr Breeze,You're the best! We're gonna have so much fun.
Fluttershy,On one condition.
Zephyr Breeze,Totally. Anything.
Fluttershy,You have to get a job.
Zephyr Breeze,"Cracking the whip, huh? You always were kind of bossy."
Fluttershy,[through gritted teeth] Zephyr Breeze...
Zephyr Breeze,Kidding! Get a job. Absolutely.
Zephyr Breeze,[yawns] Where are we goin' so early? You have no idea how bad morning sun is for your mane.
Fluttershy,Remember how we talked about you getting a job?
Zephyr Breeze,"It was just yesterday, and it's totally on my to-do list, but you can't expect to find something befitting my awesomeness overnight."
Fluttershy,I thought you might say that.
Fluttershy,So I did it for you.
Zephyr Breeze,What?!
Rarity,These fabrics all need to be dyed those colors. Do you think you can handle that?
Zephyr Breeze,"[muttering] Um, I don't know..."
Rarity,You get started while Fluttershy and I head to the store for more supplies. Ta-ta!
Fluttershy,Good luck!
Fluttershy,Thanks for giving my brother a job. I just hope he's up to the task.
Rarity,"Oh, darling, dyeing fabric is the simplest thing!"
Rarity,You just dip cloth in a bo<U+0097>
Zephyr Breeze,"[humming to himself] Rarity, you're back!"
Fluttershy,What did you do?
Zephyr Breeze,"Since you talk to animals all the time, I just figured it runs in the family, so why not outsource this stuff, you know?"
Zephyr Breeze,Turns out the animal communication thing isn't genetic.
Rarity,"Zephyr, I asked you to do this job! Not to pawn it off on innocent woodland creatures!"
Zephyr Breeze,"Okay, I guess you have some feelings about this. But you should know it's basically your cat's fault for walking by and giving me the idea. But I'm actually kinda into this look!"
Zephyr Breeze,So I guess what I'm saying is... you're welcome?
Rarity,"[frustrated stuttering] Zephyr, this is just unacceptable!"
Zephyr Breeze,Wow. I guess I know when my efforts aren't appreciated.
Rarity,Ugghh!
Zephyr Breeze,Whoa! Those are tall!
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm glad you noticed, because they're your new job."
Zephyr Breeze,Wha? [to Fluttershy] You said you were taking me to tea with the princess!
Fluttershy,"Actually, I said I was going to tea with the princess. You're going to work."
Zephyr Breeze,"Sis, c'mon!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, Zephyr, it'll be easy. I just need a Pegasus pony to fly up and wipe each window down from top to bottom."
Spike,And I'm here to make sure you do it right.
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Zephyr! This looks amazing!"
Zephyr Breeze,"Uh, you know, like you said, it was easy!"
Fluttershy,Where's Spike?
Spike,Up here!
Twilight Sparkle,"You were supposed to supervise, not do all the work!"
Spike,"I was supervising! And then Zephyr asked me about different cleaning techniques and which one was best, and if I could<U+0097> Hey! I did all the work!"
Zephyr Breeze,Don't let him fool you. Old Spike is quite the taskmaster.
Zephyr Breeze,"Oh, come on, sis. I had to ask Spike to make sure I was doing it right."
Fluttershy,"You didn't do it at all! [inhales] Well, I guarantee there won't be any fooling around on the next job."
Zephyr Breeze,Next job?
Rainbow Dash,"That's right, Zeph! You're coming with me!"
Zephyr Breeze,"You don't have to come up with some excuse to hang out with me, Rainbows! Let's just go for a fly and see where the day takes us."
Rainbow Dash,"[frustrated sigh] We're going to Wonderbolts Headquarters. And I am gonna give you a job so simple and straightforward, not even you can weasel your way out of it! [quickly] And the second you try, I'm gonna zap you with a storm cloud! Got it?!"
Zephyr Breeze,"Oh, I got it. I can already feel the electricity between us."
Zephyr Breeze,"Rainbow Dash is crazy, okay?! She expects me to do stuff right when she asks me to do it! It's insane!"
Fluttershy,So you just quit? Again?
Zephyr Breeze,"Escaped is more like it. Besides, what was I supposed to do?"
Fluttershy,"Keep trying? Finish something for once? Maybe that way, you'd actually find something you like to do!"
Zephyr Breeze,"That all sounds fine for your friends, but it's just not me."
Fluttershy,"Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I don't think you can live here."
Zephyr Breeze,Fine! I'll just go live in the woods like my foreponies before me! Guess the only breeze this zephyr can count on is his own!
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, cheer up, Fluttershy. I know it was hard, but you did the right thing. You couldn't let Zephyr pull the same stuff on you that he's always pulled on your folks!"
Fluttershy,I guess so...
Fluttershy,"Oh, hello, Constance!"
Fluttershy,"Oh? Oh, dear."
Zephyr Breeze,"See, Wigford? The Breeze needs nopony! We've got food, shelter. Just need to put the old kettle on..."
Zephyr Breeze,"Come on, sticky-sticky, make with the sparks!"
Zephyr Breeze,Ugh! What's a pony got to do to find a decent stick around here?!
Rainbow Dash,"I know he needs to learn to do things for himself, but..."
Fluttershy,Oh... I can't let him live like this.
Rainbow Dash,"Actually, I don't think he'd make it through the night."
Zephyr Breeze,"[gasps] Fluttershy! Hey! I was just, um, cozying up in my sleeping bag! Ready to call it an early night! [mock-tired] Such an exhausting day, y'know?"
Rainbow Dash,It's noon.
Zephyr Breeze,You know me! [maracas in background] Siesta...
Zephyr Breeze,Ugh... I can't do this. I can't do anything.
Fluttershy,"Zephyr, you're smart and talented. You could do anything if you just tried!"
Zephyr Breeze,"And what if I give everything I have and still fail? Honestly, I think it's better not to try at all."
Rainbow Dash,But then you won't ever do anything.
Zephyr Breeze,"I don't expect you two to understand. I mean, when have you ever failed? You've literally helped save Equestria, like, a dozen times."
Fluttershy,"And I was worried that I'd fail every time! Sometimes you have to do things, even though you might fail."
Zephyr Breeze,But failing is the worst!
Fluttershy,"And quitting doesn't feel much better, does it?"
Zephyr Breeze,No.
Fluttershy,"So here's the deal: You can come back with me, but you have to do exactly what I say. No exceptions."
Zephyr Breeze,[resigned] I will literally do anything you ask me if it means I don't have to stay here.
Fluttershy,"Okay, you know what you have to do, right?"
Zephyr Breeze,"Beg for help, then quit when I get frustrated. Just kidding! Total opposite of that. Got it."
Rainbow Dash,You think he can do it?
Fluttershy,Everypony has times in their lives When their hearts are filled with doubt
Zephyr Breeze,Frustration builds up inside And it makes you want to shout
Rainbow Dash,But if you just take that first step The next one will appear
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,"And you find you can walk, then run Then fly...! Into the stratosphere"
Others,You've got to give it your best So you can pass the test Give it everything that you've got
Others,And we know you can win You just have to begin Have to give it your very best shot
Zephyr Breeze,There are times when you want to give up When you think that you can't go on
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,But if you fight through with all of your might You will find that you can't go wrong That you could do it all along
Fluttershy,Everypony has times in their lives When their hearts are filled with doubt
Rainbow Dash,But if you just give it your all You'll start to work it out
Zephyr Breeze,"And I know I can't give up too soon Get myself in the zone And I find I can walk, then run"
Others,"[Fluttershy, Zephyr, and Rainbow Dash] Then fly...!"
Zephyr Breeze,I can do it on my own
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,You can do it on your own
Zephyr Breeze,I can do it on my own I can do it on my own
Zephyr Breeze,I did it! I actually finished something! By myself!
Rainbow Dash,And it looks exactly like it's supposed to.
Fluttershy,"I knew you could do it, Zephyr."
Zephyr Breeze,"I didn't! But I do now. Thanks for believing in me, sis."
Fluttershy,That's what big sisters are for.
Rainbow Dash,"So, Zeph, now that you've accomplished this, what's next?"
Zephyr Breeze,"Anything I want! I mean, the sky's the limit, right?"
Zephyr Breeze,"But, y'know... I've got some baby steps in mind."
Rainbow Dash,"Thanks for dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Shy! Ha! It was great as usual."
Mrs. Shy,"Mrs. Thank you, dear, for not giving up on Zephyr. After all these years of pining for him, it must be so satisfying to see him on the right track."
Rainbow Dash,Huh...?
Fluttershy,Have you heard from Zephyr? Is he doing well?
Mr. Shy,"Mr. I tell you, he's a brand new pony! So full of drive and determination."
Rainbow Dash,Heh. That's great.
Zephyr Breeze,[singsong] Guess who graduated from mane therapy training?
Rainbow Dash,"Hah, awesome!"
Mr. Shy,"Mr. Congratulations, son!"
Mrs. Shy,Mrs. You look so handsome!
Fluttershy,"I'm so proud of you, Zephyr."
Zephyr Breeze,"It was only a matter of time before they recognized my true genius! But actually doing the work probably helped, and I wouldn't have if it weren't for you."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I just gave you some encouragement. You did this on your own."
Zephyr Breeze,"And honestly, right now I feel like I can do anything... except find a place. I can still crash here for a few days, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,"As you've all probably noticed, it's been quite some time since the map has sent us on a mission of friendship."
Spike,Yeah! Ever since Starlight messed with it to go back in time and try to change history!
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes. Since then. But, as part of her studies, Starlight's been assisting me. And together, we think we've come up with a spell that can get it working again!"
Pinkie Pie,"[simultaneously] Ooh, well done!"
Twilight Sparkle,Now without further ado...
Pinkie Pie,"Fluttershy and Twilight in Appleloosa! No, me and Rainbow Dash in Las Pegasus! No, Rainbow Dash and Twilight in Yakyakistan! No, Twilight and Twilight in Twilight's castle! Oh. Me! Me! Oh, me... and Rarity! Ooh! I hope it's some faraway place that nopony has gone before!"
Rarity,"[chuckles nervously] Well, maybe not too far away. An adventure somewhere that has modern conveniences would be preferable. [gasps] Canterlot! This is wonderful! I can check the boutique! Perhaps there'll be some social events that we can attend! [gasps] I'll have to pack extra outfits! What will I wear?!"
Pinkie Pie,"Y'know, some ponies get excited about the silliest things."
Rarity,"[sighs] Now then, as far as finding a friendship problem, I suggest we start at the castle and begin to question the proper<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Rarity, you don't find a friendship problem. It finds you. We just need to go with the flow, and eventually, kablam! We get friendship problem'd right between the eyes."
Rarity,"Well, this is a team effort, so if you feel we should go with the flow, then with the flow we shall go. But where's the flow saying we should go?"
Pinkie Pie,You know Canterlot. What do you think we should do?
Rarity,"Hm. Take your pick. Culture, couture, cuisine!"
Rarity,"Oh, my. Well, it sounds like your stomach is saying we should flow towards some lunch? I know just where to go."
Rarity,"Restaurant Row, the absolute best place for fine dining in all of Equestria!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, so many choices! Where should we go? This one? That one? Those ones?"
Rarity,Any establishments that have this <U+0096> the three-hoof rating.
Pinkie Pie,"Um, whose hooves?"
Rarity,"Why, Zesty Gourmand, the Queen of Cuisine. When it comes to food, she is the ultimate authority in Canterlot and thus all Equestria. She judges a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation. Without her approval, a restaurant simply cannot survive."
Pinkie Pie,What's so important about her approval?
Rarity,"Zesty grew up around fine dining, and everypony hangs on her every word when it comes to cuisine."
Rarity,"[gasps] Oh, my! Such presentation. Mm. Oh. [smacks lips] Ah. Yes. Very nice..."
Pinkie Pie,"Nom nom nom. [gulps, gags] Maybe, I'm not in the mood for... [whispers] whatever this is. Can we try someplace else?"
Pinkie Pie,Nom nom. Ugh. Maybe one more stop?
Pinkie Pie,Blech! Nope.
Pinkie Pie,"Maybe instead of trusting somepony else's hooves, I should pick the next place?"
Rarity,Ugh! Very well.
Rarity,The Tasty Treat. It's very... rustic. [whispers] It looks like it hasn't even been rated.
Pinkie Pie,Thank goodness! Hee-hee!
Rarity,Are we sure they're open?
Pinkie Pie,[sniffs deeply] Mmmm. It smells open.
Saffron Masala,Oh! Are you here for lunch?
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, indeedy!"
Saffron Masala,"I'm Saffron Masala, the chef here at The Tasty Treat, the most exotic cuisine in Canterlot. Would you like to hear about the specials?"
Rarity,We're actually in a bit of a hur<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, please!"
Saffron Masala,We have a curried oat cake.
Pinkie Pie,We'll take one!
Saffron Masala,"Uh, and a grass sandwich that has been marinated overnight in a mustard Dijon dressing."
Pinkie Pie,How can you say no to that?
Saffron Masala,A-And for you?
Rarity,"Oh, me? Oh, I'm fine. Thank you. [aside, singsong, to Pinkie] No rating."
Pinkie Pie,Hiya! What's your name?
Coriander Cumin,Coriander Cumin.
Pinkie Pie,Are you a chef here too?
Coriander Cumin,My daughter cooks. I host.
Pinkie Pie,Then why are you stacking chairs?
Coriander Cumin,"Without customers, I have nopony to host for. So I stack!"
Saffron Masala,"Father, stop it! Don't close up the restaurant around our guests."
Coriander Cumin,"What does it matter?! When they leave, nopony else will be coming in!"
Saffron Masala,"Well, your attitude isn't going to bring anyone in! Can't you at least pretend to be positive?!"
Pinkie Pie,[slurps] So good!
Coriander Cumin,You are doing enough pretending for the both of us. Nopony here wants to try anything new! I know when to throw in the towel!
Rarity,"Um, Pinkie, perhaps we should excuse ourselves."
Pinkie Pie,"[muffled speaking] Oh, Rarity, try this!"
Rarity,[munches] Ooh!
Saffron Masala,Maybe if you would listen to my ideas for once...
Coriander Cumin,"Oh, yes! I did not move halfway across Equestria for my daughter that I never listen to!"
Pinkie Pie,"[spits] Rarity, I think that friendship problem just kablammed us right between the eyes!"
Rarity,"These two? Oh, I don't know, darling. The food is excellent, but I'm not sure there's much you and I can do to help them."
Coriander Cumin,[scoffs] What would you have me do? We can't even get Zesty Gourmand to come to our restaurant. She took one look at how empty it was and said it wasn't even worth rating!
Rarity,That's it!
Pinkie Pie,"Yes! Uh, what's it?"
Rarity,The flow has led us here! This is our mission! [to Saffron and Coriander] We are going to get you a three-hoof rating and save your restaurant! I can get Zesty Gourmand here!
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] And I can pack this place with ponies!
Coriander Cumin,Hmph. And how do you intend to do such a thing?
Pinkie Pie and Rarity,Just leave it to us!
Saffron Masala,"Father, will you please stop packing things?!"
Coriander Cumin,"When the lovely pony comes back and says she couldn't convince Zesty Gourmand to come visit us, we will need to pack all this up. I am just getting a head start."
Pinkie Pie,You really don't know Rarity.
Rarity,[singsong] I've done it!
Pinkie Pie,See?
Rarity,"It took all of my charm and cajoling, but I was able to convince Zesty Gourmand to come and try the food!"
Coriander Cumin,What is the catch?
Rarity,"Ah, yes. Well, um, there is a bit of a challenge. The only time she could make herself available is tonight."
Coriander Cumin,"Pfft. Oh, yeah, right."
Saffron Masala,What is it?
Rarity,"Zesty rates a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation, and she has very specific tastes. If she's coming tonight, there is quite a bit of work that needs to get done."
Pinkie Pie,Like what?
Rarity,"Oh, a tweak here, a tuck there, some slight modifications to the menu. [laughs nervously] We just need the place to feel more cosmopolitan."
Coriander Cumin,Pfft.
Saffron Masala,"Father, after Rarity went to all of this trouble for us, can't we at least try?"
Rarity,Why don't I stay behind with Coriander to get the restaurant ready for Zesty's arrival? You and Saffron can try and drum up some business.
Pinkie Pie,"One packed restaurant, coming right up!"
Rarity,"Coriander, I understand your trepidation. But I promise you, we will get those hooves by making this place feel just like all of the other restaurants on Restaurant Row!"
Saffron Masala,[sighs] I hope my father doesn't drive Rarity crazy.
Pinkie Pie,It'll be fine. Rarity's gonna make sure that The Tasty Treat is the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot! Not like all of those stuffy places on Restaurant Row.
Rarity,"Here' If you want to succeed You must follow the trends, that's the key"
Others,If you want to show That you've got what it takes You must be what they want you to be
Pinkie Pie,Here' Your food is so good The flavor's so fancy and free
Others,"You just need to show That unique sense of taste Go on, be yourself, let them see"
Pinkie Pie and Rarity,"It's gonna work I know it's gonna work It's gonna work out just fine, trust me It's gonna work I swear it's gonna work It's gonna work out just fine, you'll see!"
Rarity,"You need to change If you want to compete But fear not, for I know what to do"
Others,"I know it feels strange But trust me, when we're done We'll make sure that you're a hit, too"
Pinkie Pie,Don't ever change Being different is good Don't let what others do be your cue
Others,"Never rearrange 'Cause somepony said you should Just trust your heart, it will know what to do"
Pinkie Pie and Rarity,"It's gonna work I know it's gonna work It's gonna work out just fine, trust me It's gonna work I swear it's gonna work It's gonna work out just fine, you'll see!"
Pinkie Pie,Be unique
Rarity,Just be the same
Pinkie Pie,Trust your heart
Rarity,You'll make your name
Pinkie Pie and Rarity,We'll help you every step of the way Because we know what you need to do And you should know it too
Others,"It's gonna work I know it's gonna work It's gonna work out just fine, trust me It's gonna work I swear it's gonna work It's gonna work out just fine, you'll see!"
Saffron Masala,"[gasps] The day is almost over, and we haven't found any ponies! What will we do?"
Pinkie Pie,Try harder! Fillies and gentlecolts! Check out the super stupendous and amazing cuisine of The Tasty Treat! Grand re-opening tonight!
Others,"""Citrus Blush"": How many hooves does it have?"
Saffron Masala,"No hooves yet, but hopefully soon!"
Others,"""Cayenne"": Well, when it gets rated, let us know."
Pinkie Pie,Rrrgh! Stupid hooves!
Chargrill Breadwinner,"Oh, look at this, hun!"
Orange Slice,"Oh, The Tasty Treat! Do you think that's a restaurant, sugar?"
Pinkie Pie,"Yes! Yes, it is!"
Chargrill Breadwinner,"We came to Canterlot from Whinnyapolis to be adventurous. But so far, the food in all these hoity-toity places tastes like somepony cooked up nothin' with a side o' nothin'."
Saffron Masala,"Well, please, come try the Tasty Treat. I think it's going to be exactly what you're looking for."
Rarity,[sighs] This is going to be exactly what Zesty is looking for!
Pinkie Pie,"Rarity, what did you do?"
Coriander Cumin,[unenthusiastic] Welcome to The Tasty Treat. You can eat here if you want. Or not. Who cares?
Rarity,I know. Isn't it perfect? Zesty is sure to love it.
Pinkie Pie,I thought we were trying to make this the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot! Not make it exactly like every other restaurant!
Rarity,[short laugh] We want to help our friends by getting them three hooves. That will only happen if this is like every other restaurant.
Saffron Masala,"Father, what is this?!"
Pinkie Pie,Not that! Anything but that!
Coriander Cumin,This is what we must cook if we want to succeed here!
Saffron Masala,This isn't what I wanted! I wanted Canterlot to like us for us!
Pinkie Pie,"Rarity, how could you ruin the restaurant?!"
Rarity,"Oh, pff. Kch. Ts! We helped save the restaurant. Now, where are the other guests? How many other ponies are coming?"
Pinkie Pie and Saffron Masala,Two.
Rarity,Just two?! I thought you said you could pack the place with ponies no matter what!
Pinkie Pie,You said you would make the restaurant better...
Pinkie Pie,...so I guess we both didn't know what we were talking about!
Rarity,"[gasps] Zesty Gourmand! Everypony, places!"
Coriander Cumin,[unenthusiastic] Welcome to The Tasty Treat. What can I get you this evening?
Zesty Gourmand,"I hardly think it matters, but by all means, try your best to impress."
Orange Slice,"Well, we'll both try the special this evening. Maybe with a little kick to it, eh? Yeah, we've been craving some food with actual taste."
Coriander Cumin,"Saffron Masala, what are you doing?!"
Saffron Masala,I'm trying to save our reputations! [sips] I've given it at least a little bit of flavor.
Rarity,"No-no-n-n-no, but that's not what Zesty wants!"
Pinkie Pie,What kind of food expert doesn't want flavor?! That's insane!
Pinkie Pie,I'm taking this out there!
Rarity,No! Zesty will hate it! You are going to ruin this for them!
Pinkie Pie,"No, I'm trying to fix it after you ruined it!"
Pinkie Pie and Rarity,Noooooo!
Zesty Gourmand,I think we are done here.
Rarity,Zesty! Please wait! Allow me to explain!
Zesty Gourmand,"Rarity, when it comes to fashion, you are adequate. But take some advice from a friend <U+0096> keep your opinions out of restaurants. Substandard food, laughable service, and I would think even you could recognize that the decor here is trying desperately while desperately failing. Recommending a disreputable place such as this could do serious damage to your social standing."
Pinkie Pie,Disreputable?! You mean a place with food that actually tastes good?
Zesty Gourmand,Anypony can throw ingredients together and create an obvious taste that uncultured ponies like those two can register.
Chargrill Breadwinner,Hey!
Zesty Gourmand,"But it takes a true culinary artist to create a subtle taste, the barest hint of a sensation. That's what I bring to Canterlot. That's art."
Pinkie Pie,I'm so embarrassed.
Rarity,I don't know that there are words to adequately express how truly sorry we are.
Coriander Cumin,The worst has happened. No use crying over spilt food now.
Saffron Masala,Here. This always cheered me up when I was younger.
Coriander Cumin,[gasps] My spicy flat-noodle soup!
Rarity,"Oh, my! This is truly delightful!"
Pinkie Pie,"Mmm, this is the best thing you've made so far! And I thought the food before was the best!"
Saffron Masala,"That's all I've ever wanted to do, father! Make food for the ponies of Canterlot like the food we made together when I was younger!"
Coriander Cumin,It has been so long since we cooked together. Heh. Remember how you used to hide the ingredients you did not like?
Rarity,You know what? Who cares what some stuffy unicorn thinks of the food here? It's exquisite.
Pinkie Pie,That's true.
Rarity,And you don't need three silly hooves in your window to prove it.
Pinkie Pie,That's double true!
Rarity,You just need ponies in here to give it a chance! Ponies that will tell everypony else in Canterlot that The Tasty Treat has the best food in the city!
Pinkie Pie,That's true times three!
Saffron Masala,"But without Zesty's approval, nopony will even try our food!"
Rarity,"Ohhhh, yes, they will. Pinkie, we are the perfect team for this! We were just doing the wrong jobs! I will go out and bring the crowd! You stay here and make sure this place is every bit as unique and rustic as it was the moment we walked in!"
Coriander Cumin,And? What about us?
Rarity,"You two? You are going to cook! Make whatever you want, and make a lot of it! I intend to bring a crowd!"
Rarity,Would the owner of one of the premier boutiques in Canterlot put a stamp of approval on something that wasn't fabulous?
Rarity,It's almost time! Is everypony ready for the grand re-re-opening?
Saffron Masala,"Before we open, my father and I just wanted to say... Thank you for all of your help. We've both been so stressed about the restaurant succeeding that we forgot what it was we loved about it in the first place."
Coriander Cumin,"Cooking is something we used to love to do together. No matter what happens next, thank you for reminding us of that."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, you guys! Group hug!"
Pinkie Pie,Now come on! We've got a party to throw!
Coriander Cumin,Welcome to The Tasty Treat! Make yourselves comfortable!
Saffron Masala,"Please, feel free to sample the food!"
Zesty Gourmand,What's this?! What is everypony doing here?! This place has no hooves! It is not in keeping with the level of cuisine that I have set for Canterlot! Nopony told you this place was acceptable!
Others,"""Sweet Biscuit"": Uh, Rarity and her friend said it was good? They told us!"
Zesty Gourmand,They told you? And who are they to tell you anything? Rarity can tell you what hats to wear with which skirts. Her friend can tell you how to maintain a tragic look for a frizzy mane. They can't tell you what food you can eat!
Rarity,"No, we can't, and neither can you! Nopony has the right to tell these ponies what to think! Zesty, you have very... specific..."
Pinkie Pie,And very strange!
Rarity,"Yes, and very strange opinions about food, and that's your right. But just because you like your food a certain way, there is no reason to tell these ponies that they need to do the same!"
Burly Unicorn,"Rarity is right! I for one think the food here is delicious! I own The Smoked Oat on Restaurant Row; I hate the food we make! From now on, it's all smoked, basted, and grilled!"
Matronly Pony,This food is an inspiration! I own The Bake Stop. I'm going to bake my mother's bundt cake the way she made it <U+0096> full of flavor!
Rarity,"Zesty, are you sure you wouldn't like to try the food? Ignoring a unique and fresh establishment such as this could do serious damage to your social standing."
Zesty Gourmand,Hmph!
Saffron Masala,Thank you so much!
Coriander Cumin,You are both truly amazing.
Pinkie Pie,Nothing can stop the dynamic duo of Pinkie and Rarity!
Daring Do,Whoa! [gasping] Oof!
Rainbow Dash,"Well, don't stop there! You read, I pack! That's the deal!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I just keep thinking about how much fun you're gonna have at the Daring Do convention. I wish Princess Celestia didn't need my help with the friendship summit in Griffonstone."
Rainbow Dash,Don't worry. I'll make sure A. K. Yearling signs your book. I can't believe she's gonna be there! She never goes to conventions!
Rainbow Dash,"Which, I guess, will be cool for all those other fanponies. But since you and I know A. K. Yearling personally, [hushed] and we know that she's secretly Daring Do herself, [normal] it's no big deal. This convention will be fun, but it's nothing to get too excited about."
Rainbow Dash,So excited!
Salespony,"You look like a pony who'd be up for an all-inclusive one-of-a-kind adventu-cation, where you can get to live the Daring Do experience!"
Rainbow Dash,No thanks. Did that already. Ahhh.
Rainbow Dash,This is the...
Rainbow Dash and Quibble Pants,...awesomest thing ever!
Quibble Pants,Now this is something that only a true fan can appreciate.
Rainbow Dash,They even put the tiles in the right order.
Quibble Pants,"Huh. Good catch. Oh, I'm Quibble Pants. Nice to meet you."
Rainbow Dash,Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash,Nice costume.
Quibble Pants,"You, too."
Rainbow Dash,Thanks. The hard part was figuring out the right...
Rainbow Dash and Quibble Pants,...number of arrow holes.
Quibble Pants,"B-B-Because on page 84 of Sapphire Stone, i-it describes her dodging a, quote, ""score of arrows shooting forth from holes in the very walls,"" unquote, but then on page 107, Daring Do says she, quote, ""barely made it past the traps' barrage of arrows,"" unquote, but clearly, Daring Do is embellishing and the correct number of arrows is..."
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] I am so glad I ran into you. Even though I knew the convention would be totally awesome, it's more fun when you're with someone who really knows Daring Do."
Quibble Pants,I know what you mean. It's so hard to find a pony who really gets it.
Rainbow Dash,"Hm. That's weird. We've only done stuff from the first trilogy. After lunch, we should probably start working our way back through the other books."
Quibble Pants,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. There are no other books."
Rainbow Dash,"Of course there are. Daring Do and the Trek of the Terrifying Towers, Daring Do and the Many Faces of<U+0097>"
Quibble Pants,"Uh, p-please, please don't. Just don't even mention the titles. I-I'm not saying those books don't exist. I'm saying that I refuse to acknowledge them."
Rainbow Dash,Why?
Quibble Pants,"'Cause they're horrible! I mean, there isn't a single thing after Ring of Destiny that is even remotely in the realm of the possible!"
Rainbow Dash,What?! I know for a fact that everything in every one of those books is one hundred percent possible!
Quibble Pants,"Uh, and how could you possibly know that?"
Rainbow Dash,"Gyuh, uh, I just... do!"
Quibble Pants,"Well, that's a compelling argument."
Rainbow Dash,Why would you even come to this convention if you hate Daring Do so much?
Quibble Pants,"I don't hate Daring Do. The first series was smart and cool and an amazing nod to old-time serialized adventure books, that somehow manages to be self-reflective and ironic while at the same time celebrating the art form without a hint of cynicism. Which is why I came here to ask A. K. Yearling muzzle-to-muzzle why she sold out and dumbed down the rest of her books into just a series of impossible action sequences!"
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, now I know you're crazy. A. K. Yearling is awesome, and every Daring Do book that comes out is better than the last!"
Quibble Pants,"Wha... Wow. Okay, yeah, I-I-I'm sorry, but I could never be friends with somepony who's willing to believe impossible stuff is possible as long as Daring Do does it."
Rainbow Dash,"That's okay, because I could never be friends with somepony who's so focused on things being possible that he's willing to turn his back on the coolest hero of all time!"
Quibble Pants,Fine!
Rainbow Dash,Fine!
Rainbow Dash,"Look, just tell A. K. Yearling that Rainbow Dash is here, and I need her help to convince a know-it-all pony that everything Daring Do's ever done actually happened!"
A. K. Yearling,A. K. Rainbow Dash?
Rainbow Dash,A. K.! I gotta talk to you. It's an emergency!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. [hushed] Not here!
A. K. Yearling,"A. K. [hushed] Now tell me, what's going on? Is it Caballeron? Did you see him?"
Rainbow Dash,What? No. But there is a pony downstairs who thinks everything you've written after the first trilogy is totally unrealistic and terrible. And I need you to help me prove to him that it's all totally possible.
A. K. Yearling,A. K. I've got bigger problems on my hooves than dissatisfied fanponies.
Rainbow Dash,Whoa!
A. K. Yearling,"A. K. The Amulet of Culiacan, and Caballeron wants it. But the amulet's only a key. [chuckles] The real treasure is hidden in a lost temple. The Seven-Sided Chest of Chicomoztoc. Caballeron wants to sell it to the highest bidder, of course, which is why I need to find it first."
Rainbow Dash,Yes! Sounds like another awesome Daring Do adventure! But... what are you doing here?
A. K. Yearling,"A. K. Since I haven't found the temple yet, it's the safest place for me and the amulet. It's crawling with security, and if I get into trouble..."
Daring Do,...I can just blend in with all the Daring Do cosplayers.
Rainbow Dash,How can I help?
Daring Do,Just keep your eyes out for anything suspicious.
Rainbow Dash,Got it!
Rainbow Dash,Does a pony who only likes your first trilogy qualify as suspicious?
Rainbow Dash,"Heh, just checking."
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. [sighs] I find all this fanfare around my archenemy... disturbing. [to salespony] I mean, where is the booth for Caballeron?"
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. I do not see the likeness. Come, let us find Daring Do and the Amulet of Culiacan. I don't want to spend any more time in this place than I have to!"
Quibble Pants,"Well, if it isn't the pony who know impossible things can happen because she just does!"
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh! Sorry, Quibble, I've got more important things to do than argue with a pony who thinks awesome means unrealistic."
Quibble Pants,"No, wait! I want to hear more about how you're one hundred percent sure that in Curse of the Jungle Queen, Daring Do could survive a sixty-story drop from the top of a waterfall after sustaining a broken wing in a category-six rapid!"
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh! Obviously, her wing wasn't broke<U+0097> Caballeron!"
Quibble Pants,"See, now that's a great character. Solid backstory, good motivations..."
Rainbow Dash,No-no-no-no! Caballeron is right there!
Quibble Pants,"Of course he is. He's also over there, over there... Ooh, ooh, over there, and and over there. Where are you going?"
Quibble Pants,And we're out here because...?
Rainbow Dash,"Daring Do told me that Caballeron came to this convention to steal the Amulet of Culiacan, and I just saw him and his henchponies come this way!"
Quibble Pants,Okay. I'm gonna head back inside. There's just a little too much crazy out here for the both of us.
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. I do not know what Daring Do is playing at, but if she told you two fanponies of my plan to steal the amulet, you must work for her."
Rainbow Dash,"Caballeron! Hah! What do you have to say now, Quibble?"
Quibble Pants,"This was your plan to prove the Daring Do books are realistic? You bought a Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, really?"
Rainbow Dash,"What?! No! Look around us! Henchponies, Caballeron, the jungle it took forever to get to? This is the real deal!"
Quibble Pants,Right. We're actually being held captive by Caballeron. Please! This guy's accent is all over the place! No offense.
Dr. Caballeron,Dr. I...
Quibble Pants,"So what's the setup here? You've... kidnapped us, and taken us to the middle of nowhere because...?"
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. The Temple of Chicomoztoc is somewhere in this jungle. When I find it, the Seven-Sided Chest is as good as mine! I just need the Amulet of Culiacan to unlock it."
Quibble Pants,"Uh-huh, and Daring Do has the amulet so you came up with this over-complicated plot to lure her into the jungle and exchange it for us."
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. I wouldn't call it over-complicated, but... yes."
Quibble Pants,"Okay, we're done here. Great work. Seriously, very believable."
Quibble Pants,"[grunts] Listen, pal, you can keep her money, but I'm not<U+0097>"
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. Going anywhere! You may not approve of my plan, but I'm the mastermind here!"
Quibble Pants,[aside] Debatable...
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. And I say you will remain here until Daring Do comes to rescue you. And if she wants you back in one piece, she will give me the amulet! Tie them up!"
Rainbow Dash,The Griffon's Lock!
Dr. Caballeron,Dr. You know of it? Further proof that you are an agent of Daring Do!
Quibble Pants,Or an avid reader.
Quibble Pants,"Listen, if I pretend to believe this nonsense is real, will you call off the henchpony repertory theater over there?"
Rainbow Dash,They're not gonna listen to me. They abducted us both.
Others,"""Pickpocket"": What was that?!"
Quibble Pants,[unconvincingly] Daring Do. Thank goodness. We're over here.
Others,"""Pickpocket"": Fan out! We can't let Daring Do rescue these two!"
Quibble Pants,"[laughing] All four?! I mean, shouldn't at least one of them stay behind to guard us? Oh, oh, wait, the... No, because then it wouldn't be a terrible Daring Do adventure."
Rainbow Dash,It doesn't matter. We'll never solve the Griffon's Lock before they get back.
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, that was pretty good. Quick, we've gotta get out of here and warn Daring Do!"
Quibble Pants,No way. Just point me to the hotel and you can play fanpony and hunt treasure out here all day long.
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Fine. Let's just say this is a Daring Do Adventucation. The only way to get back to the convention is to go through it. So just follow me, and I'll lead you out. Deal?"
Quibble Pants,I... [groans] Fine.
Rainbow Dash,"[under her breath] Maybe if I just leave you in the jungle, it'll convince you."
Quibble Pants,"...which would make Daring Do left-hoofed, which we know is false, and that is everything that's wrong with Daring Do and the Trek to the Terrifying Tower. Now, the problems with the next book are even<U+0097> Oh, right. What Daring Do adventure would be complete without the precarious rope bridge?"
Quibble Pants,"Look, I'm all for making things feel as real as possible, but are these Adventu-cation ponies sure this thing is safe?"
Rainbow Dash,"Is it too ""realistic"" for you? Wouldn't want that on a Daring Do adventure, would we?"
Quibble Pants,"If this were really a real Daring Do adventure, I'm sure I'd step on the wrong plank at exactly the wrong<U+0097>"
Quibble Pants,Whoa!
Quibble Pants,[sighs] Good thing this is all just a pretend adventure. Least we know all of this struggling won't make the bridge fall apart.
Quibble Pants,You need to get your money back.
Rainbow Dash,Hah! How's that for not possible?
Quibble Pants,"That was... awesome! I-I-I thought we... and then you, and the flying...! Wow, and I was like, ""Where are you going?!"" A-a-and then you swerved, and I was, I was, I was on the water, and then [devolves into hyperventilating gibberish] Wow!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah. If you read that in a book, you might even think it was unrealistic."
Quibble Pants,"Okay, I'll give you that one. I mean we could have been done for. [beat] We could have been done for! W-What kind of Adventu-cation is this?! I mean, that's just, that's just bad business! What, what are these ponies thinking?!"
Dr. Caballeron,Dr. Make sure they are secure this time! We can't have them escaping again.
Rainbow Dash,[straining] You'll never get away with this!
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. Won't I? You've led me to the temple, and Daring Do is too noble to let harm befall her companions, so the amulet is as good as mine. What? No witty remarks this time about how silly my plan is?"
Quibble Pants,"This isn't the official Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, is it."
Rainbow Dash,Finally!
Quibble Pants,It's some cheap knockoff run by a bunch of incompetent ponies that have no idea how to execute this adventure with any level of safety!
Rainbow Dash,Ugh!
Quibble Pants,"What was that with the bridge?! We were in serious danger! I-I'm reporting you all to... well, I don't know who I'm reporting you to, but it's gonna be somepony important! Oh, and this cut-rate excuse for an ""Experience"" hasn't proved anything except that I'm right! It has all the hallmarks of a lame Daring Do adventure!"
Rainbow Dash,Uh... Quibble?
Quibble Pants,"No, I'm talking! Generic jungle location <U+0096> check. Overly complicated villain plot <U+0096> check. Random coincidences that conveniently get us to the next big set piece <U+0096> check!"
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. Watch where you are stepping, you fool!"
Quibble Pants,"Listen, buddy, I don't take orders from some second-rate performer who learned acting from the Supervillain School of Bad Accents! The only thing this mess is missing is some giant Ahuizotl wannabe monster, and I have a feeling that would be a bit too much for you bargain-basement adventurers to pull off!"
Quibble Pants,Huh?
Quibble Pants,Um... you're real. This is real. This is real!
Daring Do,"I told you to warn me of anything suspicious, not run off on an adventure without me!"
Quibble Pants,"Wha... Whoa, whoa, y-you're real! You-you-you're friends with her?"
Daring Do,"Uh, we'll have to do introductions later. Right now we have to<U+0097>"
Quibble Pants,"G-Get out of here, yes! Thank you!"
Daring Do,"Actually, no."
Quibble Pants,What?!
Daring Do,We can't leave without the treasure. And we should probably get to it before our friend gets any higher.
Rainbow Dash,Whoa!
Daring Do,"Seven doors, seven locks. One of them leads to the treasure. I'd rather not think about what the others lead to."
Quibble Pants,"Yeah, yeah, the classic ""Pony and the Tiger"" bit. All you have to do is<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,"Um, maybe you should let Daring Do figure it out?"
Quibble Pants,"Oh, 'scuse me."
Quibble Pants,[coughs] Not that one.
Quibble Pants,Ehhhhh...
Daring Do,Is he always like this?
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. But... he's usually right.
Daring Do,[sighs] Which lock do you think it is?
Quibble Pants,"Ugh, finally. Look, each door has another door that matches. These two both have Earth ponies fighting serpents. These two have Pegasi fighting griffons. These two have unicorns fighting bears. But this one..."
Daring Do,...has an Alicorn on it! It's the only one without a match! How did I miss that?
Quibble Pants,I've been asking myself that ever since book four!
Quibble Pants,The Seven-Sided Chest of Chicomoztoc!
Quibble Pants,"Uh, guys...?"
Rainbow Dash,Uh... The way out is totally covered! How are we gonna get out of here?!
Daring Do,There!
Quibble Pants,"Seriously, do you ever not escape out of the top of a temple?!"
Daring Do,We'll have to carry Mr. Adventure Critic out with us!
Rainbow Dash,We won't be fast enough! We'll never make it!
Quibble Pants,Guys! I think Rainbow Dash and I have this covered.
Quibble Pants,Go around! You can't go over him!
Daring Do,Go over him?! Are you crazy?!
Rainbow Dash,"If Quibble says go over him, we go over him!"
Quibble Pants,You two are insane!
Rainbow Dash,You said go over him!
Quibble Pants,I said go around him!
Daring Do,[hushed] And I said be quiet!
Dr. Caballeron,Dr. This way! I heard them!
Quibble Pants,"[hushed] Okay, I got it. Let's create a fake treasure out of mud and rocks, give that to Caballeron, and then we<U+0097>"
Daring Do,[hushed] Not every Daring Do plan has to be super-complicated.
Dr. Caballeron,Dr. Rrrgh! I swear I heard them!
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. I'll get you, Daring Dooooo!"
Quibble Pants,"Meh. Not particularly original or inspired, but it worked."
Daring Do,Who were you again?
Rainbow Dash,He's a fan.
Daring Do,[unconvinced] Uh-huh. [normal] There's some stairs on the other side of the temple that lead out of the ravine. I suggest you two take them and head west.
Rainbow Dash,What about you?
Daring Do,I've gotta get this to a museum. Thanks for your help. I couldn't have done it without you. Both of you.
Rainbow Dash,So...?
Quibble Pants,So... maybe the later books are slightly more realistic than I gave them credit for. Still don't like them.
Rainbow Dash,What?! How can you<U+0097>?!
Quibble Pants,"Wait, hold on. Before we get in another fight, I-I think I finally figured it out! I love the Daring Do that solves puzzles and uses her brain to get out of tough situations, and she did way more of that in the original trilogy! You love the Daring Do that is brave and awesome and comes out on top no matter what the odds!"
Rainbow Dash,Okay...?
Quibble Pants,"And that's okay! We might never agree on what makes Daring Do cool, but you... are definitely cool. I-I mean, the way you saved me on the bridge? Wow! And escaping from the temple... you, Rainbow Dash, are awesome."
Rainbow Dash,"Well... I-I'm not the one who can locate a treasure in half the time Daring Do can! You may have terrible taste in books, but you're pretty awesome yourself. In a brainy, egghead, puzzle-solving kind of way. Heh."
Quibble Pants,I guess we don't have to agree on everything to get along. Friends?
Rainbow Dash,Definitely friends.
Quibble Pants,"Uh, do you think A. K. Yearling would consider letting me write the next book? I... I think I can make things way clearer. I mean, for instance, in the second adventure..."
Quibble Pants,"...there's a side character. I don't want to kind of name it right now, because it's sort of this thing that I've already written a lot of fan fiction on. I don't want you to... Not that I'm saying that you would steal it! But I am saying this would totally go along my whole thing about puzzle-solving, except what if each puzzle that was solved, uh, unlocked a new karate move? Think of it that way, right? And I mean I'm kind of a ""Yearlite"" myself, so I'm sure she'd be open to<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,Uh... Quibble?
Quibble Pants,Sorry!
Students,"Good morning, Miss Cheerilee!"
Cheerilee,"Good morning, everypony! I hope you brought your thinking caps, because today we're going to learn about physics!"
Scootaloo,Physics?
Cheerilee,"Mm-hmm! Specifically, the use of force in energy conversions! In this case, using mechanical work to convert potential energy into kinetic energy!"
Apple Bloom,The what now?
Sweetie Belle,"Um, Miss Cheerilee? That sounds a bit over our heads."
Scootaloo,Yeah. Why would we even need to know that stuff?
Cheerilee,"Oh, it's very important. In fact, you'll most likely end up using it tomorrow."
Apple Bloom,Tomorrow? What for?
Cheerilee,"Why, for participating in the... Applewood Derby!"
Snails,"Oh, phew! For a second, I thought we were gonna have to, you know, learn stuff."
Scootaloo,We get to race in the Applewood Derby tomorrow? That's so cool!
Apple Bloom,"My family's talked about it for years, and now I'm finally old enough to race!"
Cheerilee,"Now hold on to your horseshoes, everypony. You've got a lot of work to do before you're ready to race."
Snips,"Yeah, but... not schoolwork, right?"
Cheerilee,"There'll be a block of applewood just like this one waiting for you at Sweet Apple Acres tomorrow, and you've got one day to turn it into a race-ready cart."
Scootaloo,"Oh, yeah... That is a lot of work."
Cheerilee,"Mm-hmm. Luckily, you'll each get to pick an older pony to help you! But choose wisely, because they'll also have to ride in the cart with you during the race."
Scootaloo,Hmmm... I think I know just the pony to ask.
Sweetie Belle,Me too!
Apple Bloom,Me three!
Cheerilee,"Just remember, everypony. Your cart has to be able to finish the race if you want to win one of the awards. Fastest <U+0096> for winning the race, naturally. Most traditional <U+0096> for the best working replica of an original Applewood cart. And most creative <U+0096> for the cart with the best overall design."
Apple Bloom,[dreamily] Hoo-wee! Those ribbons are the bees' knees.
Students,[dreamily] Uh-huh...
Cheerilee,"All right then, class! You've got a lot to learn if you want to build a race cart."
Snips,Aww... I knew there was gonna be a catch!
Sweetie Belle,Wow! Have you seen what the carts used to look like in the olden days?
Apple Bloom,"Yeah, I know all about them. When Ponyville started the Derby, they decided to use the wood from our apple trees for the carts. The race has been a part of Sweet Apple Acres ever since."
Sweetie Belle,"I just think these old carts look so cool! But I guess you and Applejack will probably win the award for the most traditional, huh?"
Apple Bloom,"The Apples usually do, but honestly, I'd rather build the fastest cart there is and win the race!"
Apple Bloom,But... I'm pretty sure Scoot and Rainbow Dash'll take that award.
Scootaloo,"You know, I race around so much on my scooter, being the fastest isn't such a big deal. Maybe I'll try to make the wildest looking cart I can think of!"
Apple Bloom,Really?
Scootaloo,"Sure! If I win most creative, you can totally win the award for fastest!"
Sweetie Belle,And I can win the award for most traditional!
Apple Bloom,Sounds like we're all gonna try somethin' different. I can't wait to tell Applejack!
Scootaloo,Let's get to it!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Go, Crusaders!"
Rainbow Dash,Are you kidding?! Of course I'll help with the Applewood Derby! I want you to have as much fun as I did when I was a filly!
Scootaloo,"Wait, Cloudsdale has a derby too?"
Rainbow Dash,Sure! Practically every town in Equestria has one! [sighs] I still remember racing my cloud cart...
Young Rainbow Dash,This is so awesome! Woo-hoooooo!
Scootaloo,And lemme guess. You won fastest cart.
Rainbow Dash,"Heh, obviously!"
Scootaloo,So what do you say? Will you help me make my race cart?
Rainbow Dash,Help you? I'm all over it! I've got tons of ideas.
Scootaloo,"Don't worry, I've got a lot of<U+0097> Whoa. Ideas of my own. Um..."
Scootaloo,What are you looking for?
Rainbow Dash,"The blueprint for my derby cart, of course! I'll have to change it a little, 'cause this race is on roads, not on clouds. But trust me, your cart is gonna be amazing!"
Scootaloo,"Um, okay, Rainbow Dash, thanks! How awesome is this? With Dash on my team, how could anything go wrong?"
Applejack,"Well, I'm mighty flattered you wanna work with your big sis on your cart. I mean, the Applewood Derby did<U+0097>"
Apple Bloom,<U+0097>start on our farm. I know.
Applejack,"Well, I couldn't be more proud to help my little sister take the prize for most traditional."
Apple Bloom,"Actually, I was kinda thinking of somethin' else. Like... fastest?"
Applejack,"[scoffs] Fastest? Apple Bloom, things aren't like they were in the old days. The fastest cart now has gotta be slick and modern and<U+0097>"
Apple Bloom,Exactly!
Applejack,"Not Apple at all. The Apples win most traditional. We have since the Derby started! Why would anypony want to win anythin' else? Now why don't you head off and get some chamomile vines, some hickory sticks, and some apple barrels, and I'll show you what an Apple family cart should look like!"
Apple Bloom,I guess I do have a family tradition to uphold...
Rarity,[gasps] The Applewood Derby?! [excited giggling] Of course I'll help!
Sweetie Belle,"Wow. Uh, Rarity, I didn't know you'd be this excited."
Rarity,"Me? Oh, why, I'm just itching to right an old wrong from long, long ago!"
Rarity,"[narrating] I designed my own cart when I was just a filly, and I was positive I was going to win the prize for most creative, hooves down! But I came in second. Second!"
Sweetie Belle,You? Second in most creative? To whom?!
Rarity,[narrating] But I learned a valuable lesson.
Rarity,"I learned to know my audience, and the race cart audience wants big! They want bold!"
Rarity,Chop chop! Everypony out!
Rarity,We've got work to do!
Rarity,...but I will fashion the biggest and boldest Derby cart to ever win the prize for most creative!
Sweetie Belle,"Actually, I was sorta thinking of something more... traditional?"
Rarity,"Oh! [tittering] Please, darling, leave tradition to the Apples. We're doing big, we're doing bold! [humming to self] Soon the prize for most creative will finally be in my hooves!"
Sweetie Belle,You mean my hooves.
Rarity,"Yes, that's what I said <U+0096> my hooves. Darling, I hope you're ready to get an early start tomorrow!"
Sweetie Belle,Uh... how early?
Sweetie Belle,"[yawns] [groans] Rarity, the sun's not even up yet."
Applejack,"Oh, apples, quit complainin'! In my day, we were up even earlier!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, I'd get up in the middle of the night if it means my cart crosses that finish line first and wins fastest!"
Rarity,And my cart wins most creative!
Applejack,"And my cart wins most traditional! Hoo-wee, it's gonna be a good day!"
Scootaloo,"You mean our carts, right?"
Rarity,"Yes, that's what we said, darling."
Applejack,Yup.
Rainbow Dash,Our carts.
Apple Bloom,Their carts? It almost sounds like they're planning on building them without us.
Sweetie Belle,"I'm sure they meant ""our"" carts. Like, the team cart, right?"
Scootaloo,"Of course! I mean, they're all our older sisters. Practically. Plus, they've all done this before. I'm sure they know best. Let's just buckle down and get to work!"
Rainbow Dash,"Scootaloo, where have you been? I've only got 'til noon to make the fastest cart ever!"
Scootaloo,"Uh, about that. I was really thinking of going for the most creative prize. I mean, I know all about speed already, so..."
Rainbow Dash,"Exactly! It's all about speed! You've gotta get across the finish line to win a prize, so we might as well get there first, right? Hey, I left a bunch of paint cans by the road. Bring them up here, would ya? Nothing as fun as painting racing stripes on the winning cart!"
Scootaloo,[sighs] Right... Fun...
Apple Bloom,"Spendin' time buildin' a cart with my big sister? Why, this is just tee-riffic! Um... how can I help?"
Applejack,"You can feast your eyes on... this! I-I mean, it ain't quite finished yet."
Apple Bloom,"Oh, good."
Applejack,"But don't it have the makin's of the best cart you ever did see? Uh... is somethin' wrong, Apple Bloom?"
Apple Bloom,"Actually, I was kinda thinkin' of somethin' a little more modern. And less rickety. With maybe a chance of winning?"
Apple Bloom,"I'm an Apple, but... what if I just take off this fringe?"
Applejack,"No, not the fringe!"
Applejack,"Ugh! Why, shoot! Now I've gotta start all over from scratch, and it's almost race time!"
Apple Bloom,"Oh. So, maybe we can redesign it then? Just a little."
Applejack,No time! And who'd want to redesign somethin' that's already perfect?
Apple Bloom,Right... Perfect...
Sweetie Belle,"Okay, so I sketched out some of my ideas."
Sweetie Belle,How about a nice yellow fringe on top?
Rarity,"[muffled] Oh-ho-ho-ho, darling, [normal] the fringe is not exactly big! And that yellow is the least bold color I can imagine!"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, it doesn't have to be yellow. But I really do love the old-timey style. Like this."
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle, precious face, ""old-timey"" is just another word for pass<e9>. Remember, big and bold! I do have a reputation to uphold! It was one thing to lose as a filly, but can you imagine if I didn't win the most creative now? Ponies might stop buying my couture!"
Sweetie Belle,But we're supposed to be doing this together!
Sweetie Belle,[sighs] Right... Wonderful...
Apple Bloom,"[tired] Hey, Crusader... How's it goin'?"
Sweetie Belle,"[sighs] Rarity's definitely made the biggest, boldest cart anypony's ever seen."
Apple Bloom,"Wow. Well, Applejack's built somethin' so traditional, it's practically an antique."
Scootaloo,"[sighs] No matter what I say, there's no talking Rainbow Dash out of making the fastest cart in Equestria."
Sweetie Belle,Doesn't look like any of us ended up with what we wanted.
Apple Bloom,But... I'm sure our older sisters know what they're doin'. Right?
Scootaloo,Right...
Sweetie Belle,Right.
Apple Bloom,"And even if our carts aren't exactly what we had in mind, it'll still be fun to drive them to the finish line."
Sweetie Belle,Sure! The race is the best part!
Apple Bloom,Yeah! CMCs behind the wheels!
Cheerilee,Derby racers to the starting line! Derby racers to the starting line!
Rainbow Dash,"The race is about to start, Scootaloo! You better shake a leg if you wanna ride in the winning cart!"
Rarity,"You, too, Sweetie Belle. There's only one seat left aboard this creative masterpiece, and it's just for you. Woo-hoo!"
Applejack,"Whoa, ponies! Wait for me! This traditional cart handles at the exact perfect pace <U+0096> slow! And I got the passenger seat all warmed up for ya, Apple Bloom!"
Apple Bloom,Passenger seat?!
Scootaloo,[grunts] They're the only older ponies driving!
Sweetie Belle,"First they built the carts, now they're gonna drive them?!"
Apple Bloom,"I know they were all excited to help, but I don't think they're really helping anymore."
Scootaloo,We better hurry if we wanna be a part of this race at all!
Cheerilee,"Um, aren't you all missing somepony?"
Applejack,They'll be along.
Cheerilee,"And, uh, [hushed] usually the younger ponies drive the carts."
Rarity,"[chuckles] Darling, do these look like usual carts to you?"
Cheerilee,"[blows fanfare] Racers! On your marks, get set, go!"
Apple Bloom,[scream turns into a grunt] Can't we go any faster?!
Applejack,Faster? Don't be silly. This is perfect!
Ponies,"Go, go, go!"
Applejack,"Check me out, racin' the Derby Check out my old-fashioned cart"
Rarity,"Check me out, racing the Derby In my original work of art"
Rainbow Dash,"Check me out, faster than ever There's nopony can catch me now"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Let me out, I'd do it over If I only knew how!"
Ponies,"Giddyup, derby racers Giddyup, derby racers Giddyup, derby racers Go, go, go!"
Rarity,My cart's the most original Designed with imagination
Applejack,"My cart's the most traditional Just plain, no complications"
Rainbow Dash,"Look at me, I am the ace Might as well give up the chase"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Wish we could stop this race Start again and do it our way
Scootaloo,Having any fun yet?
Apple Bloom,Nope! Maybe if we could go a little faster!
Ponies,"Giddyup, derby racers Giddyup, derby racers Giddyup, derby racers Go, go, go!"
Rarity,Gotta get some attention If I want that ribbon
Rainbow Dash,Gotta push the limit further Blow away the competition
Applejack,"Gotta coast on through Just relax, we're gonna cruise it"
Apple Bloom,Guess I don't really care Since we're clearly gonna lose it
Rarity,"See, everypony's watching Presentation is a glory"
Rainbow Dash,"Just passed you, even faster Speed is king, end of story"
Rarity,"Bigger, bolder down the track"
Applejack,Love the view from the back of the pack
Rainbow Dash,"Won't stop, we're on the attack"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Too late to take it all back!
Ponies,"Giddyup, derby racers Giddyup, derby racers Giddyup, derby racers Go, go<U+0097>"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Look out!
Rarity,Oh! My beautiful swan cart is an ugly duckling!
Applejack,And my old-time cart is a rootin' tootin' wreck!
Rainbow Dash,"[straining] It still counts as a win if I push my cart across, right?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,They're not your carts!
Others,"Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Huh?"
Apple Bloom,We were supposed to design them!
Scootaloo,And we were supposed to drive them!
Sweetie Belle,"The Derby was supposed to be for us, not the three of you! Now you've ruined it for everypony!"
Rarity,Mmmh...
Rarity,"Yes, well, I suppose we might have gotten a teensy bit carried away..."
Applejack,But I thought you all wanted our help.
Apple Bloom,We did! We wanted your help to build our carts. But we all ended up with carts that are what each of you wanted!
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,Mm-hmm.
Rainbow Dash,But why didn't you say anything?
Scootaloo,You've all done the race before. I just figured you knew best!
Sweetie Belle,Plus it's hard to speak up to older ponies.
Rarity,"Oh, I certainly understand that. But you mustn't think older ponies automatically know best."
Rainbow Dash,And we probably could have done a better job of listening to you.
Applejack,Oof. I guess we owe all three of you an apology.
Apple Bloom,Maybe not just us.
Rainbow Dash,"[nervous laugh] Um, how do you feel about a do-over?"
Cheerilee,I think that's a wonderful idea! But maybe the older ponies should sit this one out.
Scootaloo,"Thanks for helping us fix up our carts. Pretty creative, right?"
Apple Bloom,"I know it's not traditional, but it sure looks fast, don't it?"
Rarity,"You know, darling, I can't believe I'm saying this, but that yellow fringe is rather bold after all."
Sweetie Belle,"Thanks, everypony. We couldn't have done it without you."
Applejack,"Yup, I sure am glad Miss Cheerilee agreed to run the race over again."
Cheerilee,"Well, it isn't every year I get to say this twice, but... Derby racers to the starting line! Derby racers to the starting line! Racers! On your marks, get set... go!"
Rainbow Dash,And it's probably best keeping all the grown-ups on the sidelines. But... what are we supposed to do now?
Rarity,I think I have an idea.
Rarity,"[sipping through straw] Ahhh! Much better! Honestly, I'm not sure why we wanted to race those carts in the first place."
Rainbow Dash,Seriously! [sighs] This is the most relaxed I've been all day.
Fluttershy,I'm so sorry I lost track of time at our picnic. I didn't mean for us to get caught out here after dark. But there's really nothing to be afraid of. The forest at night is the same as the forest during the day.
Fluttershy,Only... darker.
Fluttershy,"Still, maybe we should hurry back to the cottage."
Fluttershy,Nothing to worry about. No reason to...
Fluttershy,Ruuuun!
Fluttershy,[hyperventilating] That wasn't funny! You really scared me! I hope you're happy.
Rainbow Dash,Nope. You're too easy. You're scared of everything.
Fluttershy,That's not true.
Rainbow Dash,Boo.
Rainbow Dash,"I mean, how could you not appreciate that?"
Fluttershy,Because I don't think being scared is very fun!
Pinkie Pie,"I do! Your heart gets all racy, your hooves get all tingly, your mouth gets all dry-ie! Actually, I don't like that part. But the rest is great!"
Rainbow Dash,See? Everypony likes a good prank! They're just jokes!
Rarity,"Now, Rainbow Dash, I don't think Fluttershy would have called us all here to talk about this if she thought it was funny. Everypony has things they like and things they don't."
Applejack,And scarin' Fluttershy is just lazy.
Rainbow Dash,[scoffs] Lazy?!
Twilight Sparkle,A prank isn't very good if you're the only pony laughing.
Pinkie Pie,"But what if it's really, really, really, really, really funny?"
Rainbow Dash,And I can do funny.
Twilight Sparkle,I know you can. I guess the trick is making sure that your idea of funny matches the pony you're pranking.
Twilight Sparkle,That way<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"Good one, Rainbow! Ha-ha! You have to admit! That was funny!"
Twilight Sparkle,Not really.
Applejack,Yeah. A whoopee cushion is like a joke shortcut.
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie,What?!
Rarity,"Honestly, Rainbow Dash, if you are not willing to put forth the effort required to pull a prank that everypony can enjoy, you may as well not pull one at all."
Rainbow Dash,"Fine! If you ponies want effort, then that's just what you'll get."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm not sure she understood what we meant.
Rarity,"I know you're excited about the Filly Guide Cookie Drive, but I still have to do a few finishing touches on your uniform."
Sweetie Belle,[lips smacking] Hmm. Not bad.
Rarity,"Huh. [reading] ""You asked for it."""
Sweetie Belle,What does it mean?
Rarity,"Hmm. I assume this is Dash's idea of a prank, which can only mean she's rigged some kind of booby trap to your Filly Guide uniform up there."
Sweetie Belle,So how do we get it down?
Rarity,"We don't. If Dash thinks I'm going to fall for whatever she's got in mind, she's got another thing coming. There's more uniforms where that one came from!"
Sweetie Belle,Hmm. The sewing machine cake is actually better than the cake cake.
Rarity,Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,[laughs] Gotcha! Ha-ha! How's that for effort?
Apple Bloom,"What's all this, Applejack? I thought you were gonna help me get ready for the Filly Guide Cookie Drive."
Applejack,"Uh, yeah, sorry about that. But Rainbow Dash has been on a prankin' tear, and you can never be too careful."
Apple Bloom,Do you really think Dash is gonna try and prank you in your sleep?
Applejack,Not if I have anythin' to say about it.
Applejack,"See ya in the mornin', sugarcube."
Applejack,Huh?!
Applejack,Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Ha! Still think I'm lazy? Gotcha! [laughing] Pigpen...
Applejack,[grunts] Ugh! Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,[laughs] Gotcha!
Rainbow Dash,Gotcha!
Rainbow Dash,Gotcha!
Rainbow Dash,Gotcha!
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie! We need your help.
Pinkie Pie,Okay! For what?
Rarity,Are you honestly going to stand there and tell us you know nothing about all the pranking Rainbow Dash has been doing?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, no! She's been pranking up a storm!"
Fluttershy,"Did she get you, too?"
Pinkie Pie,"[laughs] Oh, yeah! She and Gummy both!"
Rainbow Dash,Boo!
Pinkie Pie,They got me good.
Applejack,"Well, she needs to stop."
Pinkie Pie,Stop? But pranks are so much fun!
Twilight Sparkle,Not for everypony. And it doesn't seem like Dash is taking the time to find out who enjoys them and who doesn't.
Rarity,"Uh, since you and Dash share such an, uh, affinity for pranking, we thought you might be able to get her to, um, uh... quit it!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Rainbow Dash! I have something very important to tell you!"
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie, hey! I actually have something totally important to tell you!"
Pinkie Pie,You do? Ooh! You go first!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, you know how I've been pranking everypony?"
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! [giggles] It's been pretty funny! I-I-I mean, actually, that's what I have to talk to you about."
Rainbow Dash,Here. Have a cookie.
Rainbow Dash,"So, I got to thinking <U+0096> why waste my time pranking everypony one at a time when I could prank everypony at once?"
Pinkie Pie,"Mmm, wow! Everypony at once?! That sounds amazing!"
Pinkie Pie,"Gah, wait! I mean, it's not."
Rainbow Dash,"You don't even know what it is yet! Pinkie, this is gonna be the best prank ever! I special ordered these joke cookies so the colors would match my mane."
Pinkie Pie,And?
Rainbow Dash,"And I'm gonna switch them with the Filly Guide cookies. When Scootaloo and her friends sell them, everypony in town's gonna get a rainbow mouth courtesy of Rainbow Dash! Ha-ha! It's gonna be so awesome!"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really seem all that funny."
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] What?!
Pinkie Pie,Maybe this is a good time to stop pranking for a while. The other ponies in town really<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"Stop?! No way! This prank is happening, Pinkie! And it's gonna be hilarious!"
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie, what's the deal? I told you I needed your help switching out all the Filly Guide cookies for the joke cookies. But when you didn't show, I had to do it all by myself! Uh, Pinkie?"
Rainbow Dash,[chuckles] Wow. Your face is still pretty rainbowed.
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, I haven't really [coughs] been feeling well. And these joke cookies are the only thing that makes me feel better. You don't have any more, do you?!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, no. I just told you, I used them all for the prank."
Pinkie Pie,Oh.
Rainbow Dash,"Pretty soon, the CMCs will start selling them to everypony in town. Ponies will open their boxes and start eating, then all of their teeth will turn rainbow-colored, and they'll know it was me! It's gonna be so awesome! C'mon, you don't wanna miss it!"
Pinkie Pie,Actually... [coughs] I don't think I can even... stand... up... [raspy] Unless you've got more cookies!
Rainbow Dash,"Aah! On second thought, maybe you better stay here and rest."
Pinkie Pie,[sighs] Yeah. You're right. Sorry to miss out. I'm sure it's gonna be hilarious.
Rainbow Dash,"All right, who's ready to sell some cookies?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Me!
Applejack,"Look here, Rainbow Dash. I know you promised Scootaloo you'd help out, but I don't want none of your pranks ruinin' these fillies' night."
Rainbow Dash,"Look, I'll be with you the whole night so you can totally keep an eye on me."
Apple Bloom,"Come on, Applejack! Let's get started!"
Scootaloo,Yeah! We've got a lot of ground to cover!
Sweetie Belle,We wanna hit every house in Ponyville!
Applejack,I think you three should be real proud. Y'all did a mighty impressive job for your first go-'round.
Rarity,"You took the words right out of my mouth, Applejack. Isn't that right, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,[hushed] Any minute now.
Applejack,"Uh... ""any minute now"" what?"
Rainbow Dash,"Huh? Oh, uh, nothing! Have you guys noticed how quiet it's gotten? I mean, it's still early, right?"
Rarity,"Of course it's quiet. Ponies can't talk while they're eating those fabulous cookies, heh."
Rainbow Dash,You think?
Rarity,Of course. They're probably all in a cookie coma right now.
Rainbow Dash,Huh... Maybe you're right. I'll go check.
Rainbow Dash,What is going on...? Okay. Definite cookie-eating happening. But... where is everypony? They must have seen their rainbow mouths by now... They should all be running out into the streets! Unless everypony went to bed early...
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie?
Rainbow Dash,"The whole town got the cookies, and now everypony is shut up in their houses! You don't think there's something wrong with the joke cookies, do you?"
Rainbow Dash,Mrs. Cake! Phew! Have you seen Pinkie? I was thinking I might have something to do with her not feeling great.
Rainbow Dash,Uh... Mrs... Cake...?
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. [droning] Cookies...! Cookies!
Rainbow Dash,"[whimper] Uh, I can see you're busy! I'll come back!"
Rainbow Dash,Uhh!
Pinkie Pie,[droning] Cookies...!
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. [droning] More... cookies...!
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. [droning] Cookies...!
Mrs. Cake and Pinkie Pie,Mrs. [droning] Cookies... cooooooooooooookiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeees...
Mrs. Cake and Pinkie Pie,Mrs. [droning] Moooooore cooooookies...
Pinkie Pie,[droning] More cookies...
Rainbow Dash,"[pant] Twilight! [pant] You gotta come with me to Sugarcube Corner! Something's going on with the Cakes! Well, not something exactly. I mean, it may have something to do with these joke cookies..."
Twilight Sparkle,[droning] Cooooooookies...
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, no!"
Twilight Sparkle,[droning] Coooooookies...
Rainbow Dash,[whimpers] Fluttershy<U+0097>
Fluttershy,[droning] Cooooooookies...
Granny Smith,[groans] [droning] Cooooooookiiiiiiieeeeeeees...
Granny Smith,[droning] Cookies...
Applejack,You sure you don't mind us all comin' over?
Rarity,"Oh, of course not. I think the girls have earned a little celebration for all of their hard work. And I have plenty of sewing machine cake left over. Unless anypony wants a cookie...?"
Rainbow Dash,Don't touch those!
Rarity,Oh! There is certainly no call for that! There's plenty for everypony.
Rainbow Dash,Come on! We gotta get outta here!
Applejack,What in tarnation are you goin' on about?
Rainbow Dash,There's no time! You have to follow me!
Rarity,"Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you want all of those cookies, you will have to buy them, just like everypony else."
Rainbow Dash,I don't want the cookies<U+0097>!
Rainbow Dash,But they do!
Rarity,Wh-wh-what... What's happening?
Rainbow Dash,I'll explain later. Come on!
Sweetie Belle,We need to find somewhere to hide!
Granny Smith,Cookie! Cookie!
Applejack,This way!
Rainbow Dash,"[spits, pants] Did we lose them?"
Scootaloo,[pants] Why are we running from the ponies of Ponyville?
Sweetie Belle,What happened to all of our friends?
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I think it's something in the cookies.
Applejack,Ugh! That's ridiculous! Filly Guide cookies haven't changed for years! It's not like there's a new ingredient that's turnin' the whole town into cookie-cravin' zombies.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, unless there... is..."
Rarity,What are you saying?
Applejack,What did you do?
Zombie ponies,[droning] Coooooookiiiiiiiieeeee... coooooookiiiiiiieeee....
Rainbow Dash,Cover the windows!
Zombie ponies,Coooook...
Rainbow Dash,"[pants] Okay! So I may have switched all the Filly Guide cookies for joke cookies that were supposed to make ponies' mouths rainbow but somehow turned everypony into mindless cookie-eating zombies instead! I figure we just hide out here until the effects wear off, and as long as nopony else eats the cookies, we'll be fine."
Rarity,"That's lovely, darling, except for one thing... [droning] We've already eaten theeeeeeeeeemmmmm..."
Applejack,[droning] Looks like your prank up and backfiiiirrrrreeeeed...
Cutie Mark Crusaders,[droning] Cooooooookiiiieeeees...
Rainbow Dash,"No, no! Stay away! They're making you sick! You don't want these!"
Pinkie Pie,[droning] But we dooooooo... We want cookiiiiiiiieeeeeeees...!
Rainbow Dash,Nngh! Please! Stop! I never meant for this to happen! It was just a harmless prank! It was supposed to be funny! But this isn't funny at all!
Pinkie Pie,[normal] Exactly!
Rainbow Dash,What? Wait... What's happening?
Rarity,Just delighting in pranking the prankster.
Applejack,[chuckles] Yeah. How does it feel to get some of your own medicine?
Rainbow Dash,So... you're... not sick? None of you are?
Pinkie Pie,"Of course not, silly!"
Crowd,Gotcha!
Rainbow Dash,This... was all... a prank?!
Applejack,"Yep! And you can thank Pinkie Pie. After you told her about your plan to prank the whole town, she got everypony together and came up with a way to turn the tables on you."
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, shucks, it was nothing! Just a little something I threw together."
Rainbow Dash,Uh...
Scootaloo,Wow! You should see your face!
Apple Bloom,[laughs] Talk about funny!
Rainbow Dash,"[scoffs] Well, I don't think it's very funny! And I'm the one that got pranked! I was really scared! I thought I made everypony sick! You can't just go around<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,<U+0097>pranking whoever you feel like?
Fluttershy,Without thinking about how it might make them feel?
Rarity,Or if they'd even enjoy it?
Applejack,Or think it's funny?
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! [beat] Ohhh. I see what you did there.
Pinkie Pie,Pranks can be a lot of fun when everypony has a good time. I thought you just needed to see what it's like when they don't.
Rainbow Dash,"I guess I did. I'm sorry, everypony. I haven't really been thinking about how other ponies feel."
Fluttershy,"Well, I hope you learned your lesson."
Rainbow Dash,Totally! You ponies pulled off an amazing prank! I'll have to work extra hard to top it!
Rainbow Dash,Gotcha.
Twilight Sparkle,I hope Shining Armor and Princess Cadance don't think it's too soon for me to come back to the Crystal Empire for a visit. But I just know Flurry Heart's grown so much already. I wonder if I'll even recognize her.
Starlight Glimmer,"She's the only baby they have, Twilight. I think it'll be pretty easy to figure out who she is."
Starlight Glimmer,"Sorry. I know you want to visit your niece as much as possible, and I'm excited to see Sunburst again. I just don't wanna fall behind on my friendship lessons back home."
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, your work in Ponyville isn't going anywhere. Besides, I think we all know you can learn about friendship anywhere. Right, Spike?"
Spike,"[deep voice] ""Spike?"" Who's ""Spike""?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Pfft. Uh, you're Spike, Spike. And why are you dressed like that?"
Spike,"[groans] [normal voice] Guys, you're blowing my cover! How'd you even know it was me?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Because you're you... in a coat, hat and glasses. Also, we're the only ones here."
Spike,Right.
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, why do you need a disguise?"
Spike,"Last time we came to the Crystal Empire, there was a lot goin' on with the new baby and the Crystalling, but I still got mobbed in the street."
Starlight Glimmer,I wouldn't say mobbed.
Spike,And this is just a family visit. I wouldn't want the presence of Spike the Brave and Glorious to turn it into some kind of circus.
Starlight Glimmer,We get it. The Crystal Ponies adore you.
Twilight Sparkle,"He did save the Empire. Twice. But still, I don't think your presence will turn our visit into a circus."
Spike,"Not if I find the right disguise, it won't."
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, disguise or not, Spike, I don't think you need to worry about being mobbed. Nopony's here."
Spike,It's like a ghost town.
Twilight Sparkle,I've got a bad feeling about this.
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah, this is weird."
Spike,I guess I don't need the disguise after all.
Honeysparkle,It's Spike the Brave and Glorious!
Sapphire Joy,He's come to save us yet again!
Crystal Ponies,Spike! Spike! Spike! Spike!
Spike,Save you from what?
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah, what's going on?"
Twilight Sparkle,Why was everypony hiding?
Others,"""Amber Laurel"": Oh, it sure looks like Princess Twilight and her pupil."
Others,"""Scarlet Heart"": But how can we be sure?"
Others,"""Golden V<e4>s"": We can't! Either one of them could be the... you know!"
Others,"""Amber Laurel"": [gasps] What if this... [gasps] isn't... [gasps] the real Spike?!"
Others,"""Scarlet Heart"": Everypony, run!"
Twilight Sparkle,Okay. Something strange is definitely going on.
Spike,[groans] Ya think?
Royal guard 1,Who goes there?
Starlight Glimmer,"Um, you don't recognize the Princess of Friendship?"
Royal guard 1,Of course we recognize her.
Royal guard 2,But that doesn't mean it's really her.
Spike,"It's okay, guys. They're with me. And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of the Crystal Empire, am I right?"
Royal guard 2,Huh. It does look like him.
Royal guard 1,"Well, it would, wouldn't it? I'm sorry, but we'll need to see some proof of identification."
Princess Cadance,We'll take care of things from here.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Cadance, thank goodness! What's going on?"
Shining Armor,"We can explain, Twily... if it really is you."
Princess Cadance,"Sunshine, sunshine..."
Princess Cadance and Twilight Sparkle,...ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! Mmm!
Shining Armor,"It's okay, everypony. It's her."
Starlight Glimmer,Of course it's her! What's all this about?
Sunburst,A changeling's been spotted nearby.
Twilight Sparkle,A changeling?!
Spike,That's not good.
Princess Cadance,"No, it's not. After Queen Chrysalis took my place at our wedding and invaded Canterlot with her army of minions, we're not taking any chances."
Sunburst,"Changelings feed off of love. And ever since Flurry Heart's Crystalling, the Empire is filled with more love than anywhere in Equestria. It's possible they've come for the baby."
Shining Armor,"That's why we posted the extra guards, and why we're<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,Checking everypony's identity.
Princess Cadance,I'm sorry for all of this. Flurry Heart's really been looking forward to seeing you.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, she's gotten so big! Starlight and I will do whatever we can to help protect her."
Princess Cadance,"To be honest, having you here is already a big relief."
Shining Armor,Hmm. The royal guards were wondering if Spike the Brave and Glorious would like to join in the search for the changeling.
Spike,Really?
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, I don't know if that's such a good idea, Spike. It sounds dangerous."
Spike,"Come on, Twilight, this is Spike the Brave and Glorious you're talking to. Have you ever known me to run from danger?"
Twilight Sparkle,Um...
Shining Armor,He'll be safe with our guards.
Spike,Or will your guards be safe with me?
Royal guard 1,"Spike the Brave and Glorious, you've faced the evil changelings before. What can you tell us?"
Spike,"Oh, uh, well, they are changelings, so they can... change."
Royal guard 1,"[to other guards] You hear that? These monsters can look like any of us, so be on guard, guards! Even more than normal."
Spike,And they could be anywhere.
Spike,"So we should cover as much ground as possible. You, search that way!"
Spike,"And you, search that way!"
Spike,Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Oh! Uhh!
Spike,"Phew! [kisses] Okay. Maybe it's time Spike the Brave and Glorious went back to, uh, protect those guards. Gah! [sighs] Just my reflection. Huh? Ha! Ha-ha! Hmm. Just my imagination, I guess."
Thorax,"No, wait! Come back!"
Spike,[screaming] This is unexpected.
Thorax,The ice is pretty slippery. I wouldn't want you to get hurt because of me.
Spike,You... saved me?
Thorax,It's okay. I know you don't wanna be friends.
Spike,Wait! I don't understand. Changelings are supposed to be evil... right?
Thorax,"Evil? Oh, not me. All I've ever wanted is a friend."
Thorax,[narrating] From the moment I first split my egg in the nursery hive...
Thorax,"[narrating] I was part of the attack on Canterlot during the royal wedding, but I'd never seen true friendship like that! And I couldn't just steal it and feed on its love. I wanted to share it!"
Thorax,"After that, I knew I couldn't live with my kind anymore. I set off looking for love to share, but..."
Spike,But... what?
Thorax,I'm starving! And there's so much love in the Crystal Empire right now. It's what drew me here! But it's drivin' me crazy!
Spike,That would be from the royal Crystalling. It's pretty much a giant outpouring of light and love for a new baby.
Thorax,"[hisses] Oh, sorry! I'm just so hungry! If I had a friend, maybe the love we shared could sustain me, but I don't think the Crystal Ponies want to be friends."
Spike,"What if I told you there was somepony they respect and admire so much, he could convince them to give it a try?"
Thorax,If only that were true.
Spike,"It is! I mean, I am! It's me, Spike! Spike the Brave and Glorious? I'm sure you've heard of me."
Thorax,Nope. But I was raised by an evil queen. I'm Thorax. I can't believe you want to help me.
Spike,Why? Hasn't anypony ever just been nice to you?
Thorax,[hisses] Uh! S-Sorry! Kindness like that kind of brings it out. Do you still wanna be my friend?
Spike,Of course! And I am one hundred percent sure I can get the whole Crystal Empire to be your friend too.
Spike,"But... maybe I should just, uh, talk to them first."
Royal guard 1,What do you mean? Did you see the changeling?
Royal guard 2,Did you defeat the evil creature?
Spike,"Defeating a changeling would be brave, but do you know what would be glorious?"
Royal guard 1,Defeating two changelings?
Royal guard 2,Defeating all the changelings?
Spike,Not having to fight the changeling at all! Because I made friends with him.
Royal guard 1,"Oh, wow! For a second I thought you were serious!"
Royal guard 2,[laughing] Could you imagine? Friends with a changeling?
Spike,I am serious. He wants to be friends!
Royal guard 2,Right!
Royal guard 1,"Not only are you Spike the Brave and Glorious, you're also Spike the Hilarious!"
Spike,I'm not joking! The changeling is nice!
Shining Armor,"I'm sorry, but I don't think it's funny. The Changeling Queen Chrysalis kidnapped Cadance and cast a spell on me."
Shining Armor,There's no such thing as a nice changeling.
Spike,"You're right, Shining Armor. Sorry. That was a... bad joke."
Thorax,"So? So? Uh, what did they say? How many new friends do I have?"
Spike,"Well, it didn't go exactly the way I thought."
Spike,I think I might know!
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, if you're done searching for the changeling, Starlight and I could use your help. We're working on a protection spell for Flurry Heart, and nopony takes notes like you."
Spike,"Uh, actually, Twilight, I, uh, wanted to introduce you to my friend, uh... Uh, Crystal, uh... Hoof! Crystal Hoof! [chuckles] My good friend, Crystal Hoof."
Thorax,Nice to meet you.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh. Well, it's, uh, nice to meet you, too. How do you know Spike?"
Thorax,"Oh, uh, Spike and I go way back."
Spike,To the Equestria Games! That's when we met. We've been pen pals ever since.
Twilight Sparkle,Pen pals? Spike! You could have been using my pen pal quill set! Why didn't you tell me?
Spike,"Well, I... I pretty much only write to him when you and Starlight are... studying."
Thorax,I like to brag to all my friends about my letters from Spike the Brave and Glorious.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'm sure Starlight and I can manage, if you want to spend time with your friend."
Spike,Great! Crystal Hoof promised to take me around the city.
Thorax,"Oh, that was amazing!"
Spike,I told ya.
Royal guard 1,[hushed] Crystal Hoof is nearly as entertaining as Spike himself.
Thorax,"[gasps] This place is everything I've ever dreamed of! [hushed] But I can't keep pretending to be a Crystal Pony forever, can I?"
Spike,"Relax. You're winning them over. Pretty soon, nopony will care that you're a changeling."
Princess Cadance,Spike! Twilight told me you were off with a friend.
Princess Cadance,And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of mine.
Thorax,"Oh, she's so beautiful! There's so much l-love around her...! I... I...!"
Thorax,I... [hisses] I'm so... [hisses] ...sorry...! I can't... Can't [hisses] ...stop!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike! Get away from the changeling!
Spike,"Wait, no! You don't understand!"
Sunburst,This changeling replaced your friend to get close to the baby! What other explanation could there be?!
Spike,I...
Spike,...I don't know.
Royal guard 1,After it! Don't let the changeling escape!
Princess Cadance,I hope your friend is okay.
Spike,"Yeah... Me, too."
Royal guard 1,"Spike, you should go find Crystal Hoof while we hunt down the changeling."
Spike,I'm pretty sure he doesn't wanna see me.
Shining Armor,Spread out! The changeling is probably still nearby!
Spike,"Actually, I'm pretty sure he ran as far away from here as possible.... But I bet I know where!"
Spike,"Thorax! Hello? I just want to apologize! I should have stood up for you... Aw, come on, Thorax! I know you're in here!"
Spike,[yelps] [panting] Little help?
Thorax,"Why do you think I would help you? I'm an ""evil changeling""!"
Thorax,"It's okay, I know it's hard. Everyone in the Crystal Empire loves you. I couldn't ask you to give that up for me."
Spike,You don't have to ask.
Thorax,What are you gonna do?
Spike,What I should've done in the first place.
Starlight Glimmer,"I know it's bad that there's a changeling around, but is all this really necessary?"
Princess Cadance,"If there's one changeling, there may well be a whole army on the way."
Twilight Sparkle,True. But Starlight has a point. This is getting a little out of hand.
Princess Cadance,"[sighs] I understand, but I don't know what else we can do."
Spike,I do!
Shining Armor,Spike! What are you doing?! Get away from that thing!
Spike,"No. He's not a ""thing""! His name is Thorax, and he's my friend!"
Spike,Would you say I'm a hero Glorious and brave If I told you something you wouldn't believe?
Others,"That sometimes I'm scared And I can make mistakes And I'm not so heroic, it seems"
Others,But if day can turn to night And the darkness turn to light Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change?
Others,No two ponies are exactly the same No two snowflakes ever match their design And I thought I was strong But I was nothing but wrong When I forgot to be friendly and kind
Others,But if day can turn to night And the darkness turn to light Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change?
Others,Would you say I'm a hero Glorious and brave If I told you something you wouldn't believe?
Others,"This changeling, it seems Knows the real me And would stay by my side 'til the end"
Others,So if day can turn to night And the darkness turn to light Then why can't we imagine Just why can't we imagine Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change?
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, I'm so proud of you."
Spike,You are?
Twilight Sparkle,"Of course! You're a celebrity here in the Crystal Empire, and you just risked all of it for a friend! I can't imagine anything more brave than that. [to others] As the Princess of Friendship, I try to set an example for all of Equestria. But today, it was Spike who taught me that a new friend can come from anywhere. I guess everypony still has things to learn about friendship. Even me! And if Spike says Thorax is his friend, then he's my friend too."
Thorax,Thank you.
Princess Cadance,"On behalf of the Crystal Empire, I would like to extend my hoof in friendship, and I'm sure all of my subjects are eager to do the same."
Shining Armor,"Welcome to the Crystal Empire, Thorax. I'm sorry we didn't take the time to get to know you. Maybe we can change that now."
Thorax,"That'd be so amazing! I want to know all about friendship, and maybe one day I can take that knowledge back to the Changeling Kingdom! If my kind learned how to create love for one another, maybe they wouldn't have to take it from others!"
Royal guard 1,To Spike the Brave and Glorious!
Starlight Glimmer,Looks like you were right after all.
Twilight Sparkle,Right about what?
Starlight Glimmer,Friendship lessons can happen anywhere.
Discord,Tea?
Fluttershy,"Um, Princess Celestia's taking us on an overnight goodwill tour of Yakyakistan. I just found out."
Discord,[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.
Fluttershy,"If you're looking for something to do, you could spend the evening with Spike and Big Mac."
Discord,You aren't kidding.
Fluttershy,"They're very nice. They have a ""top secret"" thing they do whenever we leave Ponyville. Although everypony knows about it, so it's not a very good secret. I think you'd have fun with them."
Discord,"Fun? With sidekicks? Oh, you must think that we're in a dimension where everything is opposite. [snap] ""Da-dee-la! I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac! I'm sure I'd have fun!"""
Opposite Fluttershy,"Well, guess what, Sassafras?! I'm Opposite Fluttershy, and I'm sick of being nice and quiet all the time!"
Discord,"[snap] Let me explain it to you as simply as I can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking about. You see?"
Fluttershy,All I'm saying is it's an opportunity to expand your circle of friends. [coddling] Unless you're afraid they won't like you?
Discord,"Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that."
Fluttershy,It never hurts to make new friends.
Discord,[scoffs] Consider it considered.
Discord,Couldn't I just come with you instead?
Fluttershy,Discord...
Discord,"[gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay."
Applejack,"I got my bedroll, parka, unattractive but functional hikin' boots... Uh, anything I forgot, Pinkie Pie? You're our resident Yakyakistan expert."
Pinkie Pie,Nope! I brought yeti food!
Pinkie Pie,Did I forget to mention there's a pony-eating yeti on Frost Field Glacier? We're gonna have so much fun!
Rainbow Dash,"Heh. If he messes with us, I'll turn that yeti into confetti!"
Applejack,Heh. Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us out of here. Don't y'all have too much fun without us.
Twilight Sparkle,"I bet you boys have big plans. Right, Spike?"
Spike,"I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. Although if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to discuss it with you girls."
Twilight Sparkle,Buh-bye!
Applejack,"Bye, y'all!"
Spike,"[whispering] Uh, I dunno what to say. I mean, I hope he comes but I kinda don't want him to think of it..."
Big McIntosh,[hushed] Yup.
Discord,"Fascinating article, yes? [nervous laugh] [hushed, to himself] Don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please, please, please<U+0097> [normal] Oh, salutations, my friend! Wish I could stay and chat, but I don't want to."
Spike,"Wait! Um, we were wondering... What are you up to tonight?"
Discord,"[to himself] Oh, here we go..."
Spike,"Do you wanna, I don't know, hang out? Is that, like, something you do?"
Discord,"Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening."
Spike,[to Big McIntosh] I guess guys' night will just be you and me.
Discord,"A guys' night? You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry? Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?"
Spike,"Eh, something like that. [nervous] You should totally come. Three of us would be way better than two..."
Discord,"That does sound fun, actually..."
Spike,Too bad you're busy.
Discord,"Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around."
Discord,"[gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair."
Discord,"[normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness."
Spike,I do like basking in things. See you tonight. [hushed] Twilight's castle. The fun starts promptly at sundown.
Discord,"Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas."
Spike,"And... we have sundown. Repeat, we have sundown. I declare tonight's guys' night ceremonies officially open!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Spike,It's guys' night.
Big McIntosh,Yup.
Spike,"Oh, yeah."
Big McIntosh,Yup.
Spike,Havin' fun now.
Big McIntosh,Yup.
Spike,"Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh,"Oh, yeah!"
Spike,What the hay?
Others,"Mini- [high-pitched] Announcing the much anticipated arrival of the spirit of chaos and disharmony, the purveyor of pandemonium, lord of lawlessness, earl of turmoil, bringer of bedlam... [imitating fanfare] Discord!"
Discord,"So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short."
Spike,"Actually, we're staying here. I hope you like awesome games!"
Discord,Games? I love games. I'm great at games.
Discord,"Famous pony charades? Oh, this is an easy one. Who am I? Huh? Huh?"
Discord,"Oh, come on!"
Spike,Uh... I'm talkin' about a real game.
Discord,"Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days."
Spike,Not exactly. Wait here.
Discord,"Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix."
Spike,[off-screen] Okay!
Spike,"In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness. This is... Ogres & Oubliettes!"
Discord,"Oh, this looks like..."
Spike,The best game ever? You're right!
Discord,Yes...
Spike,"Ogres & Oubliettes is a fantasy role-playing adventure game. Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard, or... [stifling laughter] as we call him... the Squizard!"
Spike,"[chuckling] [clears throat] The Squizard has laid siege to the last free city in Spiketopia. That's the name of the land. He's kidnapped a beautiful unicorn princess named Shmarity. [beat] Uh, which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think about it too much."
Discord,Fear not. Your romantic delusions are safe with me.
Spike,First things first <U+0096> you've gotta create a character! Name?
Discord,How about... Discord?
Spike,"[sighs] The whole point of the game is you get to use your imagination to be someone you're not. I'm Garbunkle, a famous magician. Everyone treats me with the utmost respect."
Discord,Just like in real life?
Spike,"And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception."
Discord,"[not listening] Go on, I'm listening."
Spike,"Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick!"
Discord,[still not listening] I'm listening.
Spike,"When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor."
Big McIntosh,Nnope!
Discord,[clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.
Spike,"And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard."
Spike,"So, your character's name?"
Discord,"I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like ""Captain Wuzz""?"
Spike,Captain Wuzz it is!
Spike,"What class are you, Captain Wuzz? There's Archers, Mages, Rogues..."
Discord,"[snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red."
Spike,You'll love it once we get started! [rolls die] How 'bout an Archer?
Discord,Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine.
Spike,"Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Spike,"Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are you<U+0097>"
Discord,"Oh, get on with it."
Spike,[rolls dice] We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked tight.
Spike,The bars exist in our imagination.
Discord,"Really? You describe things, and then we pretend it's real?"
Spike,It is real. In our imagination. It's your turn first. What do you wanna do?
Discord,"Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game."
Spike,"Well, you can do whatever you want. Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful."
Discord,I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.
Spike,"That's a big risk. You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed. [rolls die] Ooh, bad idea. The guard gets mad."
Discord,This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip.
Spike,You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell.
Discord,I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.
Spike,[rolls die] The spell backfires. So [stifling laughter] your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips!
Spike,"The guard laughs. He calls his friends over, and they laugh too."
Discord,"Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see."
Spike,"[rolls die] [laughs] As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder!"
Discord,I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!
Spike,"I told you, you can't do magic!"
Big McIntosh,Whoaa! Nope! Nope! Nope!
Discord,"""Not intelligent enough."" Please."
Spike,"Cut it out, Discord!"
Discord,"Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a real guys' night!"
Discord,"[laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I right, fellas?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Spike,"I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape!"
Discord,I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes?
Spike,"[sighs] No, we want to go back to Ogres &<U+0097>"
Discord,"Oh, how 'bout a different game? [magic zap] Those are very bad cards."
Spike,Stop messing with us! We wanna<U+0097>
Discord,A dance contest?
Discord,Surprise! We won!
Spike,Discord!
Discord,[sinister] Yes?
Spike,"Look, we don't wanna do these things. We wanna play our game. If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know, sit and watch."
Discord,Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
Spike,Sir McBiggun?!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Spike,And I'm... Garbunkle? That means... Sweetness! We're in the game! Check it out! Ka-zam!
Spike,It's guys' night!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Spike,"Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh,Yup!
Spike,In the game now!
Big McIntosh,Yup!
Spike,"Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh,"Oh, yeah!"
Spike,"Discord, where are you? This is great! You made the game real!"
Discord,[reverberating] [laughs] Aren't games fun?
Spike,Should we be worried he's using his scary voice?
Squizard,Behold! I am the Squizard!
Discord,[reverberating] [chuckles] You're welcome.
Squizard,Attack!
Spike,Run!
Discord,"[reverberating] You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well... [laughs] You get the idea."
Discord,Seventeen! Lucky you!
Discord,Boo.
Discord,Boo.
Spike,Discord!
Discord,"Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you."
Spike,This isn't funny!
Discord,Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? Like this?!
Spike,Ugh!
Spike,"[groans] This kinda hurts! Like, real pain!"
Discord,"Oh, how kind of you to notice. It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?"
Spike,"Discord, this is awful!"
Squizard,Of course it is! Spiketopia will be mine! And Rarity shall be my bride!
Squizard,"I mean, Shmarity."
Spike,Why are you doing this? You're the worst!
Discord,"If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?"
Spike,Because we felt bad for you!
Discord,Because you... what?!
Spike,"[panting] We're okay, we're okay! No thanks to you, Discord!"
Discord,You felt sorry for me?
Spike,"Who wouldn't? Fluttershy told us you practically begged her to stay! And then at the train station, you were just standing there, all alone!"
Discord,This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you.
Spike,"[sighs] We only invited you to be nice! I mean, you're kind of a... weirdo!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Discord,"I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool? Ugh. [zap] [muffled] How embarrassing. I should go. [normal] I have a lot of other friends I need to see tonight."
Spike,Good!
Discord,"Yes, so many other friends. [whimpers] Farewell, Garbunkle the magician and brave Sir McBiggun. May providence smile upon thee in thy quest to rid Spiketopia of the dreaded Squizard... [sighs] When I say it that way, the game doesn't sound half bad."
Discord,"Oh, well."
Spike,"[sighs] It... it's better this way, right?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Spike,"Because... now he can't bother us, 'cause he's off somewhere by himself... all alone... with no friends."
Big McIntosh,Yup.
Spike,"[sighs] [clears throat] [unenthusiastic] We find ourselves in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked, and... Ah, who am I kidding? We should give him another chance. [clears throat] Captain Wuzz? Can you hear me?"
Discord,Oh! You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me?
Discord,"Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss..."
Spike,What?
Discord,I'm ssssssss<U+0097>
Spike,Can't hear you.
Big McIntosh,Nope.
Discord,"I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you! [pants] [quickly] Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we?"
Spike,"Huh? Yeah, yeah! Okay! What if we forgot the board and the pieces for a minute? I mean, the whole game coming to life was completely terrifying, but also kind of the best thing ever! So, uh, Big Mac and I were wondering... What if you toned it down just a teensy bit?"
Mane Six,Huh?
Spike,"I've got your back, Captain Wuzz!"
Big McIntosh,Wha-hah!
Discord,[accented] Garbunkle! Follow my lead!
Spike,Bull's-eye!
Discord,Nice one!
Spike and Discord,It's guys' night!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Spike and Discord,"Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Spike and Discord,Having fun now!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Spike and Discord,"Oh, yeah!"
Big McIntosh,"Oh, yeah!"
Twilight Sparkle,We should just close the door and let them finish... whatever this... is.
Rainbow Dash,No way! Did you see Big Mac's sword? I totally want in!
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! I don't know what it is, but it looks like super duper fun!"
Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash,Guys' night!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Applejack! Whatcha doin'?"
Applejack,"Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Well, I was practicin' my distance buckin'."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, distance bucking? What for?"
Applejack,Because Cousin Braeburn and the rest of the Apple family in Appleloosa seem to think that their team can beat Ponyville at buckball.
Rainbow Dash,"What?! Ha! That's ridiculous! Nopony beats Ponyville! I mean, I could beat the whole town of Appleloosa at buckball with one wing tied behind my back!"
Applejack,So I can count on ya to join the Ponyville buckball team?
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, yeah! I am so there! I've just got one question."
Applejack,Hmm?
Rainbow Dash,Uh... what's buckball?
Rainbow Dash,"So, basically, buckball is the coolest game ever. Offense, defense, teamwork, nonstop action! It's got it all!"
Fluttershy,"Wow, Rainbow Dash. You sure seem to know a lot about this game. I've never even heard of... buckball."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, I'm kind of an expert."
Applejack,Hmph. An expert who hadn't heard of the game either until I told you.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, it's a new game. I probably know more than most ponies, so that makes me an expert."
Pinkie Pie,"I don't know anything about it at all. But it sounds like there's a ball and bucking, so I'm betting it's super duper fun!"
Applejack,"The point is, my cousin Braeburn somehow convinced a Pegasus and a unicorn to come play with him on the Appleloosa team, and he can't stop braggin' about how his team is gonna beat ours!"
Fluttershy,"But, um, we don't have a team."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, between Applejack and me, we've got two-thirds of a team. All we need is a unicorn. That's where you two come in."
Pinkie Pie,"[whispering loudly to Fluttershy] Uh... they know we're not unicorns, right?"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, obviously. You're gonna be on my team, and Fluttershy is gonna be on Applejack's team."
Applejack,We'll play against each other along with whatever unicorns want to try out until we find the best one.
Pinkie Pie,Ohhhh! Phew! That's a relief because I left my unicorn costume at home!
Applejack,"I know a lot of you are here because I told you what an amazin' game buckball is. And even though it's already an Apple family favorite, most o' you probably don't know anything about it. So I thought we'd give you a quick demonstration. The two Earth ponies are on offense. They meet in the middle of the field for the buckoff. They both try to be the first one to kick it."
Rainbow Dash,"And the Pegasus is on defense. She tries to keep the ball from going in the goal and passes it back to the Earth pony on her team. Just give it a little kick, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,Yaah!
Fluttershy,Aah!
Pinkie Pie,Ohhh. I get it.
Applejack,And all the unicorns have to do is float these here baskets around the outside of the field and catch as many balls as possible for their team. [to Pinkie and Fluttershy] You two get the idea?
Pinkie Pie,Absolutely!
Fluttershy,"Oh, I don't know. That ball moves pretty fast."
Rainbow Dash,All right. Now let's see which of you has what it takes.
Others,"Unicorn Player # Um, what do I do?"
Rainbow Dash,"When the ball comes towards you, catch it."
Applejack,"Okay, just try your best, Pinkie. I have been doin' this a lot longer than you."
Pinkie Pie,[grunts] Aah!
Applejack,[dazzled] Nice kick.
Applejack,"Great save, Fluttershy!"
Rainbow Dash,"Coming your way, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie,Somersault kick!
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, this game is easy!"
Fluttershy,Ooh! [giggles] It actually is kinda fun!
Applejack,Where did Pinkie Pie learn to buck like that?
Rainbow Dash,And Fluttershy's spinning tail catch is pretty amazing.
Applejack,"Um... okay. Well, let's see what the rest of you can do."
Applejack,"Now, don't expect to be able to beat me twice in a row."
Fluttershy,"Well, hello there, Mr. Ball. Whee!"
Rainbow Dash,Hiya!
Fluttershy,"Hurry along, butterflies, before that ball comes and hits you."
Sea Swirl,Aah!
Applejack,Nope. Um... okay. Let's see what the rest of you can do.
Rainbow Dash,Nope.
Applejack,Definitely not.
Rainbow Dash,No.
Applejack,Not a chance.
Rainbow Dash,No.
Applejack,Nope.
Rainbow Dash,Aaaand... no.
Rainbow Dash,[groans] This didn't go how I thought it would.
Pinkie Pie,"Whee! [giggles, grunts] Yeah! Ha! [giggles] Whee! Ha ha!"
Applejack,It sure didn't.
Fluttershy,This game is a whole lot more fun than I thought it would be.
Pinkie Pie,It's exactly as much fun as I thought it would be! A whole bunch!
Snails,"Carryin' my water My water, my water Carryin' my water On my shoulder pole"
Pinkie Pie,Snails! Look out!
Snails,Hmm?
Applejack,Amazing!
Snails,You should be more careful with these. You could lose them.
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Snails, can you float one of those baskets over here?"
Snails,Hmm? Sure. What do you want me to do with it?
Applejack,Catch!
Snails,Anything else?
Fluttershy,"Wow, Snails. You're a natural at buckball."
Pinkie Pie,"It's a good thing, too. We were running out of unicorns."
Fluttershy,Do you think you'll be ready to play with Applejack and Rainbow Dash against the Appleloosa team?
Snails,"I guess I'll find out. Plus, after I deliver this water, I don't really have anything else to do."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, Snails, with you on the team, Ponyville is one step closer to crushing Appleloosa!"
Applejack,"Huh. And after today, it's pretty clear who the other two players should be."
Fluttershy,W-What do you mean? I thought you and Dash were gonna play.
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! If you're not crushing Appleloosa, who is?"
Rainbow Dash,"[laughs] Uh, you two, obviously!"
Fluttershy,"Um, you want us to play buckball against Appleloosa instead of you?"
Rainbow Dash,Mm-hmm.
Pinkie Pie,"That's ""uncredible""!"
Pinkie Pie,Unbelievable and incredible? [scoffs] Come on!
Applejack,"I can't explain it, but you two are really good at this game. And if it means beatin' Appleloosa, I'll give either one of you my spot on the team quicker than Granny Smith can core an apple."
Rainbow Dash,"Me, too. I'd normally be so pumped all of Ponyville was counting on me to win, I'd run right over the competition. But you still flew rings around me."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sorry. I was just having fun."
Applejack,"Well, you can have all the fun you want as long as it's while you're beatin' the hide off of Braeburn's team."
Pinkie Pie,I do like fun!
Fluttershy,"Honestly, the game was a little scary at first, but once I got the hang of it, I had a pretty good time."
Pinkie Pie,Let's get this party started!
Applejack,"All right. But if we really wanna beat Appleloosa, we're gonna have to get serious."
Fluttershy,Serious?
Pinkie Pie,Serious how?
Applejack,With serious practice!
Fluttershy,[gulps] Wow. This looks pretty intense.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, duh! You two are gonna be representing all of Ponyville. And, more importantly, us!"
Applejack,"That's why, before we leave for Appleloosa tomorrow, you two are gonna practice just as hard as we would."
Rainbow Dash,So let's hop to it! Snails already has a head start on you!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, if you wanna win, you totally gotta get this drill down!"
Fluttershy,I-I-I do?
Rainbow Dash,It's all about ball control.
Fluttershy,[gasps] Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,"Ready? Go! Come on! Faster! You don't want Ponyville to lose because you can't get into high gear, do you?!"
Fluttershy,[gasps] Whoa! Ugh!
Applejack,All right. Bein' able to buck a ball into a goal from any direction is the most important thing in the game.
Pinkie Pie,"Eh, if you say so."
Pinkie Pie,Whee! Woo-hoo!
Applejack,Keep it up! Just one miss'll ruin the Apple family's buckball reputation forever!
Pinkie Pie,Whoops.
Rainbow Dash,Come on! Push! Push! Push!
Applejack,"Come on, now! Every shot is for Sweet Apple Acres! And me! And Dash! And all of Ponyville!"
Pinkie Pie,Whoa! Uhh! Ow.
Rainbow Dash,Faster!
Fluttershy,Whoa!
Applejack,Come on now!
Pinkie Pie,Wh-Wh-Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Come on!
Applejack,Keep it up!
Pinkie Pie,Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Come on!
Applejack,What in the apple happened to those two?
Rainbow Dash,I don't know. They mopped the field with us before.
Applejack,"All right! That's it for today, y'all!"
Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie,Phew!
Pinkie Pie,I thought practice was supposed to make us better.
Fluttershy,Maybe we just need a little rest.
Rainbow Dash,Or a whole lot of it.
Applejack,Just be sure to get your heads in the game before tomorrow. All of Ponyville is countin' on a win.
Fluttershy,"I really don't want to let Applejack and Rainbow Dash down, or anypony else, but after that practice, I'm not feeling very confident."
Pinkie Pie,Maybe we weren't that bad!
Pinkie Pie,I guess I was hoping you saw something I didn't.
Fluttershy,"I know our friends want us to win, but how can the whole town be counting on us if most ponies have never even heard of buckball?"
Pinkie Pie,I know! How can we disappoint a pony who doesn't even know we have a team?
Fluttershy,Or that we're gonna play Appleloosa?
Pinkie Pie,Pfft. Yeah. I don't think we need to worry. I'd be surprised if anypony in this town cares about this game at all.
Crowd,"Go, Ponyville! Go, Ponyville! Win, win, win! [background cheering] Woo-hoo! Ponyville! Way to go!"
Snails,Whoa. The whole town really seems to care about this game a lot.
Rainbow Dash,Heh. We kinda went around town and talked up the team a little.
Applejack,Yup! We wanted to make sure you two knew that all of Ponyville was behind you!
Pinkie Pie,[nervous] Greaaaaat...
Applejack,I hear the whole town's already plannin' a parade for when you get back after whuppin' Appleloosa! That should feel pretty good!
Fluttershy,[nervous] It should...?
Rainbow Dash,"Totally! Just spend the whole ride to Appleloosa thinking about everypony cheering for the victorious Ponyville buckball team! [gasps] I bet Princess Celestia even comes to congratulate you! If that doesn't get you in ""the zone"", I don't know what will!"
Fluttershy,"I don't know what zone Rainbow Dash is talking about, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be in it. Do you?"
Rainbow Dash,Hey! You two are supposed to be in the zone!
Pinkie Pie,[squeaks] You see... the thing is... thinking about everypony... thinking about us...! Aah! There's just no way to...!
Fluttershy,"There's no way that we can get in the zone, because the zone sounds like a horrible place since we are terrible at buckball and we are going to lose and let everypony down and we don't want to play anymore!"
Snails,"I'm still okay with playing, in case you were worried."
Rainbow Dash,I don't get it. They're naturals! Why wouldn't they want to play anymore?
Applejack,Maybe us telling them how much everypony was countin' on them messed them up somehow.
Rainbow Dash,What?! That's crazy talk! Having ponies depend on you is exactly what you need to focus! And<U+0097>
Applejack,Get serious and play hard and<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"Get ready to totally smash the competition, and<U+0097> and... none of that sounds like Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it?"
Applejack,"[sighs] Guess not. We got so wrapped up in what's important to us, we went and ruined what was fun about the game for them."
Rainbow Dash,[groans] What do we do now?
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie? Fluttershy?
Applejack,We know you're in here! We've looked in every other car on the train!
Fluttershy,[muffled] Maybe you need to look again!
Pinkie Pie,[muffled] Yeah! Because... we're totally not in here!
Fluttershy,[muffled] And we're definitely not in here if you're gonna try and make us play against Appleloosa!
Pinkie Pie,Or anypony else!
Fluttershy,Oh... we're sorry to let you down. But it's better to do it now than during the game against Appleloosa.
Rainbow Dash,You don't have to play against Appleloosa.
Fluttershy,We don't?
Applejack,Nope. We're gonna take your place. So you don't have to worry about that at all.
Pinkie Pie,[sighs] Why didn't you say so?
Rainbow Dash,But... we can't take on Braeburn and his team without any practice. So we need you to play just one more time.
Applejack,Against us.
Applejack,"Now I know we mixed up the teams before, but since Dash and I really need the practice, we'll play against the two of you."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I don't know how much practice you'll get against us. We've been playing just awful."
Rainbow Dash,Don't worry about it. Applejack and I just need a little workout.
Applejack,Yup. You two just do your best.
Pinkie Pie,I can do that!
Applejack,Ahem.
Fluttershy,[grunts] Huh!
Fluttershy,Looks like you two really do need practice!
Pinkie Pie,Hee-hee! Ha! Whee!
Fluttershy,"[giggling] If you need more practice, we can keep going."
Pinkie Pie,Yeah! I could do this all day!
Rainbow Dash,"[panting] No, thanks. Playing against you two is just as humiliating now as it was when we weren't trying to show you how awesome you are."
Pinkie Pie,Wait... what?
Snails,Finally!
Applejack,You must've noticed how you aren't bad anymore.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, yeah! Weird!"
Fluttershy,"But, um, why were we so terrible before?"
Rainbow Dash,"I guess some ponies thrive on pressure and some ponies don't. And even though we weren't playing, we were treating you like us, which totally stressed you out."
Applejack,And that just sucked the fun right out of the game for you.
Rainbow Dash,"And having fun is what makes you really, really, really good!"
Fluttershy,But being good doesn't matter if we're too afraid of letting ponies down.
Pinkie Pie,Yeah! What about all those ponies back in Ponyville counting on us to win?
Applejack,"I'm sure folks want you to win, but not if worrying about it makes you miserable. Winning's never worth that."
Fluttershy,But how do we keep from worrying about it?
Snails,You could do what I do and not think about it. Seriously. I don't think about anything. Ever.
Pinkie Pie,Hm. Works for me!
Announcer,"And with another bouncing goal from Pinkie Pie, the score is tied!"
Rainbow Dash,You guys are amazing!
Pinkie Pie,[panting] Braeburn is really good!
Fluttershy,"So is that Pegasus. Oh, I don't know if we can win."
Snails,You know what I would do?
Pinkie Pie,Not think about it?
Snails,"Not think a<U+0097> [beat] Oh, yeah. That."
Applejack,"Ha. And as long as you're havin' fun, it doesn't matter if you win or not."
Pinkie Pie,[giggles] I think it's more fun this way!
Announcer,"And Pinkie wins the buckoff! But her shot's rejected! Back to Braeburn, whose kick's stopped by another Fluttershy save! Next point wins. Lots of tense back and forth here. Fluttershy unleashes her patented spin move, but Braeburn's there to<U+0097> No! It's Pinkie with a somersault kick! What a move! And that's the game! Ponyville wins!"
Crowd,[chanting] Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville!
Applejack,Huh. Looks like you three made quite an impression!
Braeburn,"Well, cousin, I have to admit. Your Ponyville team played a pretty good game."
Rainbow Dash,Hah! Good game? We bucked the hooves right off of you!
Braeburn,"Yup, you sure as shootin' did. I'm gonna have to get real serious about a strategy for our rematch."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I wouldn't get too serious."
Pinkie Pie,Yeah! Everypony knows the secret to good buckball is just having fun!
Sweetie Belle,So Scootaloo's keeping Petunia busy like you asked. What did you two want to talk about?
Mrs. Paleo,"Mrs. I'm sure you get these questions all the time. Oh, this is so awkward."
Mr. Paleo,"Mr. Um, you're the experts, so we thought you'd have some insight into our daughter's new, uh, cutie mark."
Apple Bloom,What's wrong?
Mrs. Paleo,"Mrs. Obviously, we're both very proud of her and her cutie mark..."
Mr. Paleo,"Mr. Despite its, um... unsettling nature."
Sweetie Belle,Unsettling?
Apple Bloom,I don't get what you mean.
Mrs. Paleo,Mrs. Her mark doesn't... bother you at all?
Scootaloo,Hey! Check out what we found!
Petunia Paleo,Look! A spiny-backed ponysaurus! In our own backyard! And I found him on my very own! How cool is that?!
Mrs. Paleo and Mr. Paleo,Mrs. Paleo and Mr. Oh! [chuckles] She's an archaeologist.
Scootaloo,"Of course! What'd you think she was gonna be, a pirate?"
Mrs. Paleo,Mrs. Pirate? Pfft! Why would we think that?
Scootaloo,"Woo-hoo! Another successful cutie intervention! You know, Crusaders, I don't wanna toot our own horn, but we've helped a lot of ponies figure out their purpose in life. Like Bluenote here. Nice saxophone, Bluenote!"
Apple Bloom,"Yep, everywhere you look, there's a pony we've helped find a purpose."
Apple Bloom,You've gotta admit. We've had a pretty good effect on everypony since we've discovered our destiny.
Scootaloo,And started helping other ponies discover theirs! Could this get any better or what?
Sweetie Belle,"Now, Scootaloo, you do know there will always be challenges? Someday, somepony might even come to us with a problem that even we can't handle. Like, say..."
Apple Bloom,A griffon?
Sweetie Belle,Ha! Exactly! Like a griffon. But that's just crazy talk.
Scootaloo,Or not!
Sweetie Belle,Is that really a griffon?
Apple Bloom,You're darn tootin' it is! What do you think that griffon wants?
Sweetie Belle,"I guess we've gotta ask her, but aren't griffons supposed to be kind of mean and cranky?"
Scootaloo,"Crusaders, looks like we've gotta step carefully."
Scootaloo,[strained voice] Aah! Ooh! This... griffon's... not... cranky.
Apple Bloom,How in the blooming apples did you know who we are?
Gabby,"Know who you are? Know who you are?! Why, I've heard about you from everypony in Ponyville! I'm so excited to meet you, I could just explode! I'm Gabriella, but you can call me Gabby since we're friends now! Pleased to meet ya!"
Apple Bloom,"Well, howdy... um... Gabby."
Gabby,[squeals] I'm just about the most excited anygriffon has ever been about anything!
Sweetie Belle,Excited? But whatever for?
Gabby,What for? What for?! Everypony in town tells me of your amazing assistance! How you help ponies find their place in the world!
Scootaloo,"It's a calling, but<U+0097>"
Gabby,"And that's why I'm here. I need help, too. I want you to give me a cutie mark!"
Apple Bloom,"Um, can a griffon even get a cutie mark?"
Scootaloo,"I dunno, but I think we should probably find out."
Scootaloo,"So, Gabriella..."
Gabby,"Gabby, 'kay?"
Scootaloo,"Gabby, why do you even want a cutie mark?"
Scootaloo,It doesn't seem like a very... griffon-y thing to want.
Gabby,Right? Right?! Right?!
Gabby,"You're tellin' me! I don't know if you've heard, but griffons can be a little bit... unfriendly."
Gabby,"[voiceover] Most griffons don't pay much attention to each other. And if they do, it's not, y'know, the good kind of attention. As for me, I'm just a little mail delivery griffon who likes to spread a little bit of griffon-y sunshine on my rounds, which always makes me feel different from the other griffons."
Gabby,[voiceover] I'd do anything for any old griffon in need.
Elderly griffon,Ahh! Uhh!
Gabby,"[voiceover] But it just always seemed like the harder I tried, the less I fit in. It wasn't until your friends came to Griffonstone that I realized some creatures actually like helping each other, and I saw something so awesomely awesome <U+0096> how helping spreads from pony to pony and griffon to griffon! I knew then that I had to find out why I was so different from the other griffons, and I knew the answer just had to have something to do with those wonderful, amazing marks on the ponies' flanks. And I admit, hehe, I became, um, maybe a little obsessed. So first chance I had to deliver a letter from Gilda, I took it, so I could find the perfect pony to help me understand what those marks are. Everypony here told me one thing <U+0096> I just had to see the Cutie Mark Crusaders! They've helped everypony here get their cutie marks, and I knew, I just knew, that someday I'd have one, too! A cutie mark of my very own!"
Gabby,"That's why I flew all the way here! I want to find my own place in the world, and I know you can help me by giving me a cutie mark! So let's make with the cutie! [giggles] Whenever you're ready. Did it happen yet?"
Sweetie Belle,"Uh, not exactly."
Gabby,Howboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnow?
Apple Bloom,"Um, Gabby, I hate to break it to ya, but it sounds like you might've heard some tall tales about what Crusaders can do."
Scootaloo,"I mean, we are kinda awesome and all, but nopony can just give you a cutie mark. It just sort of... happens."
Sweetie Belle,"Though I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen to griffons. Or if it does, we've never ever heard of it."
Gabby,"Oh. I hadn't thought of that. Sounds like a challenge! And who could be up to it but the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders? Cutie marks! It's in your name and everything, right? Right?! Right?! Now I have to deliver Gilda's letter to Rainbow Dash. I bet by the time I get back, you'll have it one hundred percent figured out! Toodles for now! Whee-hee-hee! Gonna get my cutie mark!"
Sweetie Belle,"What she wants... It's not possible, right?"
Scootaloo,I don't know. But I know someone who just might.
Twilight Sparkle,"I've read every book on the subject, and I've never read a thing about any creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark."
Scootaloo,"But, Twilight, Gabby flew all the way here so we could help her. There's gotta be something we can do."
Sweetie Belle,"Say, is there some kind of spell you can whip up to make her mark appear?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, I don't know if any of you remember, but using magic to get a cutie mark never really works out all that well."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Ohhh. Right.
Twilight Sparkle,"Crusaders, I'm sorry. While I can't say for certain that it's utterly impossible, the chances of Gabby getting an actual mark are... pretty slim. Everything I've ever learned tells me. It's just not gonna happen."
Apple Bloom,"Oh, no! Poor Gabby! What the apples are we ever gonna tell her?"
Sweetie Belle,"Crusaders, this is terrible! Gabby really believed in us. And now, we're gonna let her down."
Apple Bloom,But what else can we do?
Scootaloo,"Hmm. You know what, Crusaders? So what? Maybe we can't help Gabby get a cutie mark, but we can still do what we're best at. We can help her find her purpose!"
Apple Bloom,And I reckon doing that is the same for griffons as it is for ponies or any other creature in Equestria.
Scootaloo,"All we have to do is be extra-special clear with her. Like, Crystal Empire clear."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Yeah!
Gabby,Incoming!
Gabby,"Hiya, you wonderful, wonderful Crusaders! I just know you've figured out how to help me because you're all so incredible!"
Scootaloo,"Well, Gabby, we've talked it over, and we think we may just be able to help you out. But not exactly in the way you think. See, here's the thing about you getting a cutie mark<U+0097>"
Scootaloo,Wait! You didn't let me finish!
Sweetie Belle,"Um, I think maybe that could've been clearer."
Sweetie Belle,She's still going. Anypony know if griffons ever get tired?
Gabby,"What do you think my mark will be? A lightning bolt? An erupting volcano? I don't care if it's a jar of marmalade! I know I'll love it, whatever it is!"
Apple Bloom,"Hold on just a hoofstep, Gabby. There's somethin' we need to clear up. We can definitely help you find your purpose, but that mark's probably not gonna happen."
Gabby,What?!?
Scootaloo,It's true. Twilight's never heard of a creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark.
Gabby,"Oh! [laughs] Is that all? You had me worried for a second. I-I mean, there's a first time for everything, right? And she didn't say it was impossible, right?"
Apple Bloom,"Well, not exactly."
Gabby,"Well, then if anypony can make it happen, it's you three. I mean, you haven't failed yet."
Scootaloo,"You know what, Gabby? I promise we're gonna do everything we can to help you get your mark."
Sweetie Belle,Aaaaand... she's off again.
Apple Bloom,Why in tarnation would you promise somethin' that just can't be done?
Scootaloo,I know what it's like to want something that's out of reach. And just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it can't. Maybe trying for the impossible isn't so bad.
Sweetie Belle,Guess we'll never know for sure unless we give it a try.
Apple Bloom,"All right, but where do we even start?"
Scootaloo,Where we always do <U+0096> with a good old-fashioned Crusaders chart.
Apple Bloom,The first thing we gotta do is find your purpose.
Scootaloo,Nopony gets a mark without one.
Gabby,All right. Let's do this.
Scootaloo,What are you good at? Do you play any sports?
Apple Bloom,Or like to dance?
Sweetie Belle,Or how about singing? I just love to sing! La-la-la-la!
Gabby,"Wow! I kinda wanna just try everything! I mean, I don't even know what to pick!"
Scootaloo,Don't worry. That's what we're here for.
Sweetie Belle,Like a racer at the starting line You're chomping at the bit
Scootaloo,You are here to find your purpose And a place you really fit
Apple Bloom,And until you find your place in life You're never gonna quit
Cutie Mark Crusaders,We can help you find the purpose in your life
Gabby,A griffon mixes lion's strength With winged eagle's might When I finally find my purpose Then my cutie mark's in sight
Others,"Crusaders, I won't let you down I've just begun to fight You're gonna help me find the purpose in my life"
Others,"Got a job that's just no fun? Call on me, I'll get it done Cauldron's stuck and needs a mix? I'm the one who's got the fix"
Others,"Help you teach pre-calculus Scrub the floors, won't make a fuss Clearing kelp? Just give a yelp Raring to go, ready to help!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"That's the spirit You ought to see what you do best Try it all, pick your fave And leave behind the rest"
Gabby,"I'll try anything To get my cutie mark Keep up with me, Crusaders We're just getting our start"
Others,Rock your little ones to sleep While hanging up the sheets I can help you with your heavy load Walk Granny 'cross the street
Others,I'll run you 'round the bases fast It's really no big feat
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Can we help her find the purpose in her life?
Gabby,"Cheer you if you're feeling low Plant your garden, make it grow Write a piece for your quartet Filling in on clarinet"
Others,Bake that cake as fast as lightning
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"She's so good at things, it's frightening Cutie Mark Crusaders, I think we've got a problem!"
Gabby,Build a boat And sail it out across the sea Need some help? You know that you can count on me
Others,"CMCs, you're gonna help me find my purpose The purpose in my life! In my life!"
Apple Bloom,Now how we gonna do this?
Sweetie Belle,"Gabby's special purpose can't be everything, right?"
Apple Bloom,It may as well be. I don't know how we find what she's supposed to do when she can do it all.
Scootaloo,"[sighs] And if finding her purpose seems impossible, we can just forget about the whole griffon-getting-a-cutie-mark thing, which is actually impossible. I never should've gotten her hopes up!"
Gabby,"I did... it... all! So, lay it on me, Crusaders. What's my purpose? And how do we get a mark on these here haunches?"
Scootaloo,"Gabby, we... we don't."
Gabby,Wait. What are you saying?
Apple Bloom,We're sayin' that since you can do everything so amazingly well...
Sweetie Belle,We just can't figure out what one thing you're supposed to do.
Scootaloo,"Gabby, we can't help you."
Gabby,"But, but... you're the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can't believe it! I... I... I won't believe it!"
Apple Bloom,"Gabby, wait!"
Scootaloo,"We're sorry! We're so, so sorry! This is just awful. For the first time ever, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are cutie mark failures."
Scootaloo,"I'm sorry, Crusaders. I really thought we could help Gabby."
Sweetie Belle,I thought we could help anypony.
Apple Bloom,Maybe that's just it <U+0096> maybe we can only help ponies.
Scootaloo,Or maybe we just plain failed.
Gabby,Failed? Then what do you call this?!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,A cutie mark?!
Sweetie Belle,What? You got your mark after all! Even though we couldn't find your purpose? But<U+0096> What? Huh?! How?!
Apple Bloom,And what does it mean? A cauldron?
Gabby,"Uh... I don't know. Maybe it means my purpose is, uh, helping Zecora with potions. That was the first thing I tried. I guess it just took some time to appear. But here it is!"
Scootaloo,"This is awesome! We're not failures! Whatever we did worked! I had a feeling we could help you, and we did!"
Apple Bloom,Oh! We've gotta go see Twilight right away! She'll wanna know about this!
Sweetie Belle,Correction <U+0096> she needs to know about this! I bet she'll want to write a whole book about the very first griffon to get a cutie mark of her own!
Gabby,"Oh, uh, totally! Um, but, you know, Rainbow Dash asked me to pick up her answer to Gilda's letter. I better take care of that before I forget. Heh. Here's an idea. Uh, y-you head to the castle, and I'll meet you there, cutie mark and all! Um... toodles!"
Scootaloo,"Wow! Can you believe it? We were able to help her get her mark after all! Come on, Crusaders, let's tell Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Gabby? You just missed her. She was in such a hurry, she didn't even come in. Just dropped this letter and zoomed away!"
Scootaloo,"[reading] ""Dear Crusaders, I'll never forget you. You really are every bit as awesome as I'd heard. I'm heading home to tell all the griffons how you did the impossible by getting me my cutie mark. Toodles."""
Twilight Sparkle,Wait a second. Cutie mark?
Twilight Sparkle,You actually got a griffon a cutie mark for the first time in recorded history?! You know what this calls for? A full-scale research project!
Sweetie Belle,This makes no sense. Gabby didn't come in and show you her mark?
Twilight Sparkle,"You have got to get Gabby back here right away! I have so many questions! Oh, I hope I have enough ink and parchment to document everything! Spike! Guess what just happened!"
Apple Bloom,Weird. Gabby didn't show Twilight her mark like she said she was gonna do? Somethin' in this here applesauce smells kinda fishy.
Scootaloo,"We'd better find her and find out what's going on. Come on, Crusaders."
Scootaloo,"Keep your eyes on the skies, ponies. Gabby can't have gone far."
Apple Bloom,"She's not in the air. She's right there! Gabby! Hold up, we're a-comin'!"
Sweetie Belle,"Gabby, we're your friends. Why in Equestria are you running away from us?"
Gabby,"Running away? Oh, I'm not running away. I'm just, uh, e-excited to show my lovely new cutie mark to everyone in Griffonstone!"
Apple Bloom,You mean the cutie mark that's runnin' right off your flank?
Gabby,[defeated] Yup... That's the one. I guess the one thing I'm really not good at is faking things.
Scootaloo,"Wow, Gabby. Painting on a fake cutie mark to make yourself feel better? You must have been really upset."
Gabby,"Sure, I was disappointed. But I didn't do it to make myself feel better. I wanted to make you feel better."
Gabby,I couldn't bear you three thinking you failed after you tried so hard to help. That's why I had to leave before you or Twilight found out the truth. [sighs] I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you. I'll just wing my way back to Griffonstone. Thanks for trying.
Apple Bloom,You don't need to apologize for carin' about how other ponies are feelin'.
Sweetie Belle,I'm just sorry we couldn't come through for you.
Scootaloo,"Hmmm... Maybe we can. Gabby, clean up and meet us at the Crusaders' clubhouse!"
Gabby,"I know you all tried your very best, but I guess griffons and cutie marks just don't mix. Maybe... I don't even have a special purpose."
Scootaloo,"Hang on a second. We were racking our brains trying to figure out your destiny, until we remembered how every time you did something new, you tried to help everypony around you."
Sweetie Belle,"Even us. How did it feel when you showed up with that fake mark, and the three of us thought we'd actually helped you?"
Gabby,Well... I was really glad I helped you feel happier.
Scootaloo,So maybe helping is your thing! You might even say it's your purpose!
Gabby,But helping just feels good. I-It couldn't have anything to do with what I'm supposed to do with my life... right?
Scootaloo,"Gabby, finding your special purpose doesn't have to be about being good at something. It's about feeling good about something inside."
Apple Bloom,And it looks like your destiny is a whole lot like ours <U+0096> helping others. And you don't need a symbol on your flank to know that.
Sweetie Belle,"But since we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we made you one anyway. Behold!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Your very own cutie mark! Ta-da!
Scootaloo,We carved it to mark the moment we all figured out what you should do with your life.
Scootaloo,"You bet we do! You're one of us now! Gabby, today we dub thee..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,The very first griffon member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders! Woo-hoo!
Sweetie Belle,You may not be able to get a cutie mark...
Apple Bloom,But you're selflessly dedicatin' your life to helpin' others anyhow. I can't think of anything more Crusader-y than that.
Gabby,Awesome! My very own cute-cea<f1>era!
Apple Bloom,"Oh, land sakes! You sure have earned it."
Sweetie Belle,"And so have we! Scootaloo, you're pretty amazing. Even though things looked bleak, you still found a way to help Gabby in the end."
Scootaloo,"'Course! Helping's what we do, right?"
Gabby,"[laughing] I am so grateful! I'm gonna go home and do my very, very best to bring Cutie Mark Crusader values to Griffonstone! I promise."
Scootaloo,"Promise us one other thing, too?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Come back soon!
Scootaloo,"After all, you're a Crusader now. Crusaders forever?"
Gabby,Crusaders forever!
Applejack,The map is sendin' us where?!
Fluttershy,Las Pegasus?!
Applejack,But Las Pegasus is a wild vacation spot! It's just one big party!
Fluttershy,"All those lights and sounds, not to mention the crowds... Oh, just the thought of it is overwhelming!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I know Las Pegasus doesn't seem like either of your cups of tea, but I have total faith you wouldn't have been called unless you were the perfect ponies for the job."
Applejack,"Probably not as bad as we think. It can't just be a loud, obnoxious party all the time... right?"
Fluttershy,"Uh, Applejack? It isn't as bad as we thought."
Applejack,You're right. It's worse!
Fluttershy,"Do you think the map could be on the fritz again? I mean, this place seems a lot more suited to Pinkie Pie or even Rainbow Dash."
Applejack,"If Twilight trusts the map, then so do I. All we have to do is solve our friendship problem and get back home. 'Course, we have to find it first."
Barker,"And make sure to experience our signature show, Ponet Fantastique! Trust me when I say you've never seen anything like it! Unparalleled acrobatics! Unique animal antics! Your only regret will be that you didn't see it sooner! And like everything at this amazing, incredible, I-can't-believe-it-even-exists hotel, Ponet Fantastique is brought to you by the chairpony of kindness <U+0096> Gladmane himself!"
Fluttershy,Wow. This Gladmane sure seems impressive.
Gladmane,"Well, uh, it is a little embarrassing, but the crowds seem to like it. Uh-huh-huh."
Applejack,Mr. Gladmane?
Gladmane,Just Gladmane'll do. And it's a pleasure to meet actual cohorts of the Princess of Friendship! Thank you for coming. Thank you very much.
Fluttershy,You know who we are?
Gladmane,"I'm what you might call a friendship connoisseur, so naturally I'm familiar with the friends of the great Twilight Sparkle! Applejack, Fluttershy, it's an honor to have you here. Uh-huh-huh."
Applejack,I have to admit you're not the type of pony I expected to find in Las Pegasus.
Gladmane,"[laughs] Well, my guests may be looking for lights, music, and parties, but working hard and making friends is how I turned this hotel into what it is today, and how I plan to make it even bigger. Uh-huh-huh! Uh, excuse me for a second. [inhales] [through loudspeaker] Wise ponies may say the folks that come here are customers, but I can't help but thinkin' of each and every one of you as friends. That's why there's a three-for-one special on apple fritters in the cafe for the next hour! Enjoy! Uh-huh-huh!"
Gladmane,Would you two like to take a tour of the place? I'm just about to do my rounds and check on my friends who work here.
Fluttershy,[hushed] We do have a friendship problem to find.
Applejack,"Lead the way, Mr. Gladmane!"
Gladmane,"Just Gladmane now, you hear?"
Trapeze Star,"[gasps] Gladmane, you're just in time to see my newest move!"
Gladmane,"New moves or not, I'm glad to have a star like you working for me, I'll tell you what."
Trapeze Star,"Oh, don't make me blush! Now watch this!"
Gladmane,Stellar! Uh-huh-huh!
Director,Oh! Oh! Monsieur Gladmane himself is here! Let's run through the whole routine!
Gladmane,"Now, don't make a fuss for ol' me. I'm just gonna keep on giving a tour to my new friends Applejack and Fluttershy."
Applejack,Howdy!
Fluttershy,Hi.
Director,"If zis pony calls you friend, you're welcome backstage anytime! I owe him my entire career."
Gladmane,"Aw, shucks. Well, let's leave the artists to their work."
Applejack,[hushed] Doesn't look like there's any friendship problems here.
Fluttershy,[gasps] I've never seen a pink prairie dog before!
Gladmane,I like the folks that come here to have a unique experience. Uh-huh-huh.
Others,"""Roar Horn"": Und we love him for it!"
Others,"""Sprigfield"": With Gladmane's help, we've been able to take care of all these little guys!"
Fluttershy,Now this place is overwhelming in a good way!
Gladmane,"Aw, glad you like it."
Applejack,[clears throat] Fluttershy?
Fluttershy,"Hmm? Oh, um, coming!"
Fluttershy,There doesn't seem to be anything wrong around here at all.
Applejack,I figured lookin' for a friendship problem in Las Pegasus would be like tryin' to find a needle in a stack of needles. But everypony seems to be gettin' along just fine.
Flim,"Ladies and gentleponies, despite what my competition might say, I know you've come to this fair city to be entertained, and I assure you there is nothing more entertaining than the astounding acrobatics in Gladmane's Ponet Fantastique!"
Flam,"Now, I suppose that might be true if it weren't for the existence, and far superiorly entertaining presence, of the show-stopping exotic animal act that Ponet Fantastique includes!"
Fluttershy,Those voices sound familiar.
Applejack,They sure do. Flim and Flam.
Flim,"Why, I won't even dignify that assertion with a response! Except to say that if you were to consider buying your tickets from me, I might consider offering them to you at a substantial discount!"
Flam,"But I've always thought you get what you pay for, and in my humble opinion, these tickets are a value at twice the price!"
Flim,Don't let this price-gouging charlatan take you for a ride!
Flam,[gasps] Charlatan? How dare you!
Flim,Hah! How dare I?!
Flam,"[simultaneous] Yes, how dare you! I was the one that..."
Flim,"[simultaneous] I call 'em likes I see them, dear brother of mine!"
Flam,"[simultaneous, background] I'm two minutes older than you <U+0096> don't you forget that, brother of mine!"
Flim,"[simultaneous, background] I'm sick and tired of this..."
Fluttershy,They certainly don't seem to be getting along. [gasps] You don't suppose we've been brought here to help them?
Applejack,Absolutely not!
Fluttershy,"I know you and the rest of the Apple family have had your issues with Flim and Flam in the past, but they're definitely having trouble, and solving a friendship problem is important, no matter who's having it."
Applejack,"Well, of course that's true... for anypony but them!"
Gladmane,"I'm sorry you had to see that. I don't know why, but those two have been fightin' ever since they got here. I thought giving them these jobs might help, but I... I guess it just made matters worse."
Applejack,"Trust me. I know those ponies, and you're better off with them apart. The two of them together will cheat the hooves right out from under you!"
Gladmane,"Yeah, I suppose you're right. Flim's such a showpony, and Flam has such a head for business. Why, if they ever did work together, they'd be running this place in two shakes! Ah, speaking of which, I'd better get back to work. Y'all enjoy your stay now, you hear?"
Fluttershy,I'm pretty sure we should help Flim and Flam...
Applejack,"And I'm pretty sure there's another friendship problem here, and I'm gonna search this resort top to bottom 'til I find it!"
Flim,I hope you didn't travel all the way from Ponyville to try to get me to reconcile with my no-account brother.
Flam,Brother? I don't believe I have one of those.
Flim,"No! I already know what he thinks of me! All show and no substance! Well, if he's so smart, he should have no trouble becoming a big success on his own!"
Flam,"""Ooh, why, he's the greatest salespony that ever lived, of course!"" Just ask him. He'll tell you all about it."
Fluttershy,I'm sure you could work out your differences if you just sat down and talked to each other.
Flim and Flam,I'm never speaking to that pony again!
Director,[muffled] No! [normal] You are ruining my show!
Trapeze Star,"It isn't just your show, and I'm improving it."
Director,You don't pull a rabbit out of a hat on the trapeze!
Trapeze Star,That's the point <U+0096> to give the audience something they've never seen before! Acrobatic magic!
Bernard Rabbit,Ta-da!
Trapeze Star,"It's called ""blending genres"", and it's awesome!"
Applejack,Shouldn't somepony do somethin'?
Others,"""Back Stage"": Hah. They've been doing this since they started working here. Too bad, really. If they ever stopped shouting at each other, we could take the show on tour. They'd be way more successful than staying at Gladmane's."
Applejack,Heh-heh. Now that sounds like a real friendship problem!
Others,"""Roar Horn"": Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!"
Others,"""Sprigfield"": Stop! What are you doing?! It's supposed to be a pink prairie dog pyramid! It's alliterative!"
Others,"""Roar Horn"": Wha<U+0097> You said a tower! Why do you keep changing everything?"
Others,"""Sprigfield"": I'm not changing anything! You said pyramid!"
Others,"""Roar Horn"": [shrieks] You are driving me crazy!"
Applejack,I thought you two got along.
Applejack,Two friendship problems in the same theater? Now we're talkin'!
Fluttershy,"If you count Flim and Flam, that's three big friendship problems all in the same place!"
Applejack,"Well, I don't count Flim and Flam since those two not bein' friends isn't a problem."
Fluttershy,It certainly isn't for Gladmane. Sounds like he's better off with them fighting.
Applejack,"Actually, the other ponies' problems seemed to be good for Gladmane too. Both the trapeze show and the animal act would be better off if they left, but everypony's so busy arguin' that they can't."
Fluttershy,Do you think he knows?
Applejack,"I don't know, but I'm startin' to think we should find out."
Trapeze Star,"Of course Gladmane wants everypony to get along. He's the nicest, most genuine pony I've ever met. Did the director put you up to this?"
Director,"I tell you, if Gladmane is your friend, you are welcome backstage. But if you are speaking of him poorly, you leave!"
Others,"""Roar Horn"": Gladmane is the kindest, most gentle..."
Others,"""Sprigfield"": ...most compassionate pony I've ever known!"
Others,"""Roar Horn"" and ""Sprigfield"": My problem... is with him!"
Applejack,"I just can't figure it! The only pony who benefits from all this feudin' is Gladmane, but by all accounts, he's the best friend any of these ponies have!"
Fluttershy,"Well, Bernard <U+0096> that adorable bunny from the acrobat's act <U+0096> claims that every morning, Gladmane tells the director that the star wants control of the show, and every afternoon tells the star that the director wants to get rid of her! But neither is true!"
Fluttershy,And the Flying Prairinos <U+0096> the pink prairie dog family <U+0096> say Gladmane keeps changing their act to make each trainer think the other is doing it!
Applejack,So all his talk about friendship is just a load of applesauce! He's gettin' them all to fight with each other on purpose!
Fluttershy,But how can we get everypony to believe that's what he's doing?
Applejack,There must be a way to trick him into telling the truth!
Fluttershy,"Gee, if only there was a pony who knew how to trick a trickster."
Fluttershy,Or maybe a pair of ponies?
Applejack,[sighs] Fine. Guess bringin' Flim and Flam back together might be why we're here. Maybe.
Flim,"Sorry if I don't take the word of somepony off the street, even if that street is in Ponyville."
Fluttershy,But Gladmane is behind so many other friendship problems. How can you be sure he isn't the cause of yours?
Flam,Because the only problem I have is standing right there.
Flim,"Same here, buster!"
Applejack,Do either of you even know what you're fightin' over?
Flim,Gladmane let me know that ex-brother of mine thinks I'm just a mouthpiece without a single good idea!
Flam,Gladmane assured me this former fraternal foal here thinks I couldn't sell heat lamps to yaks!
Applejack,Sounds to me like neither of you said those things. Why'd you believe Gladmane when he said you did?
Flim,Why would he lie?
Fluttershy,Because he's afraid that the two of you together could move in and take over his resort.
Applejack,"And if I'm tellin' you he said it, you know it's the absolute truth because<U+0097>"
Flim and Flam,You never lie!
Flam,"Oh, brother of mine, I think it's time for a little payback!"
Flim,The Canterlot Two-Step?
Flam,"Mmm, we don't have the chickens. How about the Baltimare Flair?"
Flim,"Ah, my flair isn't what it used to be."
Gladmane,"[over loudspeaker] Listen here, y'all! If you're a friend of mine, you're entitled to a free night's stay, and everypony is a friend of mine! Thank you. Thank you very much."
Flim,Are you thinking what I am?
Flam,The High Roller Hustle!
Applejack,The what now?
Flam,"Trust us. When we're done, there won't be a pony in town who doesn't know the Applejack-iest truth about Gladmane! That is, assuming you two are willing to help."
Flim,What size gown do you wear?
Gladmane,"Wh-What's all the fuss, now?"
Flim,"It's the grand matriarch of the Rich family, Impossibly Rich! She's one of the wealthiest ponies in Equestria."
Gladmane,"Well, why didn't somepony tell me? You know how I like to give VIP guests my personal touch."
Flim,"Well, she's not exactly a guest. Word is she's planning a resort of her own. [hushed] I think she's here to scout the competition."
Gladmane,"[hushed] Oh, really?"
Flim,"And with her bits, she could take over the whole strip, hire away anypony she wants!"
Flim,"Uh, not me, of course! I love it here. My good-for-nothing brother, on the other hoof..."
Gladmane,"[snorts] Impossibly Rich, what an honor it is to have you at my humble five-hoof resort. I'm sure Flam has done an excellent job showing you around, but nothing could beat a personalized tour from the mane himself. Uh-huh-huh."
Flam,You'll have to excuse Ms. Rich. She saves the energy other ponies spend talking out loud and uses it to make more money.
Flam,"She'd love a personal tour! Say, in, uh, about an hour?"
Gladmane,"Well, that sounds right pleasant. And if you can break away for a moment, Flam, I'd love to see you in my office so I can get ready."
Fluttershy,Are all of you sure this is a good idea?
Flim,Abso-tively!
Flam,Gladmane is one fish that's hooked but good!
Applejack,I sure hope you two know what you're doin'.
Flam,"Oho, don't you worry. When it comes to throwing ponies off their game..."
Flim,No two ponies do it better than us!
Applejack,Can't argue with that.
Flam,"Hey there, boss, Impossibly Rich is just about ready for that tour. So what did you want to see me about?"
Gladmane,"Actually, there's something I want you to see <U+0096> the Grand Plan. Every hotel on this strip as amazing as this one, and every one of 'em mine."
Gladmane,"And all it'll take is a little salesponyship, like this."
Gladmane,"[over loudspeaker] Hey there, friends. Uh-huh-huh. If you think my resort is fantastic, wait 'til you see Ponet Fantastique! Tickets are on sale now. Two for the price of one! Thank you. Thank you very much."
Gladmane,Now I know Impossibly Rich has probably made you a tempting offer to come work for her.
Flam,"Well uh, now that you mention it..."
Gladmane,"And as your friend, I'd never tell you what to do. But nopony's gonna stand in the way of my plans, no matter how rich she is! And I sure wouldn't want you to end up on the losing side. Think you might consider staying here?"
Flam,Um...
Gladmane,Well all right then.
Applejack,They're comin'!
Gladmane,"And last but not least, Ms. Rich, the jewel in my crown."
Flam,Impossibly wants you to know she's very impressed but doesn't think you can keep a resort of this caliber going for long.
Gladmane,Oh? And why's that?
Flam,Because you've got the best talents in the industry. What stops them from just leaving to join any competitor?
Gladmane,"[laughs] Well, you see I have a trick for that, I must confess. Uh-huh-huh. And it all has to do [also over loudspeaker] with how I handle my employees."
Flam,And how is that?
Gladmane,"[also over loudspeaker] Well, like friends, of course! And I treat every one of my employees with the kindness they deserve."
Flam,"[stammering] That's it? That's your secret, heh-heh? There's... [clears throat] ...nothing else?"
Gladmane,"Nope, just friendship. But you know all about friendship, don't you... Fluttershy?!"
Flim,You knew the whole time?
Gladmane,Never try to con a con-pony. Uh-huh-huh. [laughs] Yeah!
Gladmane,I'd have thought you'd have hit the road by now.
Fluttershy,"Whether we were able to fool you or not, you can't just go on keeping ponies from getting along! It's just... mean!"
Gladmane,"Now, maybe it is. But it's a meanness that works. Unlike your pathetic little ploy. I practically invented the ""High Roller Hustle"". But I suppose I should be impressed. You're the only ponies to ever figure out the secret to my success. Takes a lot of work keepin' everypony fightin'. But as long as I keep 'em convinced that I'm their only friend, all of Las Pegasus will be mine. Oh, you can't trick a confession out of a pony like me! I'm always one step ahead."
Applejack,"Well, you better check your hooves, because you've just stepped in a confession!"
Gladmane,"Oh, no. No, no, w-w-wait, wait!"
Fluttershy,[over loudspeaker] Did that sound okay?
Flim and Flam,Never better!
Applejack,"[over loudspeaker] Flim and Flam told us you'd see right through the fake rich pony bit, and that once you did, you wouldn't be able to resist gloatin' about it! This was all part of the plan!"
Gladmane,"Oh, now, now, friends! Listen, I-I can explain everything!"
Director,I think you've done enough of that! Darling?
Trapeze Star,Hmph!
Others,"""Roar Horn"": Oh, I cannot believe we let him almost ruin our friendship!"
Others,"""Sprigfield"": And our act. Good luck finding another one!"
Applejack,Gladmane has left the buildin'!
Fluttershy,I guess the map wasn't on the fritz after all.
Fluttershy,"If it weren't for your history with Flim and Flam, you never would've been so determined to find somepony else to help, and we never would have found out what Gladmane was doing."
Applejack,"And if it weren't for you wantin' to show even those two con-ponies kindness, we never would have been able to trick the trickster. [to Flim and Flam] Must've felt pretty nice to finally put all your connivin' and cheatin' skills to good use."
Flam,"In fact, we might think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
Flim,"Emphasis on ""once""."
Fluttershy,[suspiciously] What do you mean?
Flam,"[over loudspeaker] While this establishment undergoes a slight change in management, my brother and I want to assure you that it remains the pinnacle of Las Pegasus entertainment! Which is why we invite each and every one of you to experience the wonder of the Ponet Fantastique Theater <U+0096> at half the normal cost of admission!"
Flim,"[over loudspeaker] And while you're appreciating this historic venue totally devoid of any performers of any kind, we invite you to use the wonder of your own imaginations to fill the space at no additional charge!"
Applejack,Flim and Flam!
Twilight Sparkle,"[yawns] I've prepared a full day of spells. You've been doing great, but now it's time for a real challenge!"
Starlight Glimmer,Oh-ho-ho! It is on! Where do we begin?
Twilight Sparkle,Teleportation! Multiple locations! Try to keep up!
Twilight Sparkle,Transfiguration!
Twilight Sparkle,Shields!
Starlight Glimmer,Whoo! I am on fire! What's next?
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe there is such a thing as too much studying.
Starlight Glimmer,"As you know, speed spells like Accelero are not easy. But if done correctly, they can allow you to be much more efficient with your day."
Spike,"Way to go, Starlight!"
Starlight Glimmer,"[laughing] I'm not finished. I've discovered a very old spell, Similo Duplexis, when combined with Accelero in just the right way... [doubled up] ...you can literally be in two places at once! [normal] [sighs] Now I'm finished."
Twilight Sparkle,"I have to admit, your skills with magic really are nothing short of amazing. I'm very impressed."
Starlight Glimmer,[laughing] I've always been something of a natural.
Twilight Sparkle,"However, it doesn't look like you've tackled any friendship lessons since you met Trixie."
Starlight Glimmer,Are you sure? I could've sworn there were a couple in there somewhere...
Twilight Sparkle,I'm sure.
Starlight Glimmer,"I see... Well, I'm really quite busy this week. So many commitments. I'll try and find some time in my<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"No time like the present! Spike and I are headed to Canterlot. Princess Celestia wanted me to give her students a quick overview on the history of enchanted objects in Equestria. We'll be back after the presentation, which should be..."
Spike,Twenty moons from now?
Twilight Sparkle,Tonight. It's a quick presentation.
Spike,"[to himself] Sure, keep telling yourself that..."
Twilight Sparkle,"You can tackle a friendship lesson today, and we can review your progress when I get back later this evening."
Starlight Glimmer,[nervously] Of course! No problem! Friendship lesson... On it...
Twilight Sparkle,"Great! Can't wait. Now, Spike, help me color-code these cards according to time, place, and object."
Starlight Glimmer,"Huh? Huh! [humming and muttering to self] Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm."
Spike,Hey! Twilight and I are about to head to Canterlot. Just checking to see if you need anything before we left.
Starlight Glimmer,"Nope, not at all! I'm good here. Oh, not good <U+0096> great! Not a problem in the world! Heh."
Spike,"[disbelieving] Uh-huh. So... what are you doing, exactly?"
Starlight Glimmer,"I... was... just trying to decide which friendship lesson I was going to tackle while you two were in Canterlot. Bap-ba-du... Oh, yep, right here, where I just left them a second ago."
Spike,"[blows] [reading] ""Bake a cake with Pinkie Pie,"" ""scrapbook with Applejack,"" ""sew with Rarity..."""
Spike,"""Help an animal with Fluttershy,"" ""chillax with Rainbow Dash?"" What is chillaxing?"
Starlight Glimmer,No idea.
Spike,"You know, uh, if you're nervous about your friendship lessons, it's totally okay to say so."
Starlight Glimmer,"Nervous, me? [fake laughter] Oh, Spike, you really are hilarious, ha-ha. You think I'm nervous that I'm gonna fail something as simple as baking a cake?"
Spike,"Well, if you were, it'd be<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,"Silly! Twilight just said how impressed she was that I combined a speed spell and a duplication spell. That was a challenge. These? Pfft, hah! I could combine all five of these at the same time without breaking a sweat."
Spike,I think maybe you're missing<U+0097>
Starlight Glimmer,"An opportunity to really impress Twilight? [gasps] Great idea, Spike! I'm gonna get right on that! Good talk."
Spike,And I thought Twilight was the master of the freak-out.
Starlight Glimmer,"So, with your help, I figure these should be done in no time."
Applejack,Are you sure this is what Twilight would want? Seems like you might want to take your time with each of these.
Starlight Glimmer,"But by working as a team, we can get them done faster. And isn't teamwork a key factor in friendship?"
Applejack,I... guess.
Starlight Glimmer,"Super! Pinkie Pie, since we're baking, you will be in the kitchen."
Starlight Glimmer,"Rarity, Applejack, you two can set up in the library."
Rarity,"Oh, I don't know that a dusty old library has the proper lighting. Perhaps we can stay out here in the foyer."
Starlight Glimmer,I thought that Fluttershy and I could work with the animals right here in the foyer.
Fluttershy,"Oh, um, whatever you think is best."
Starlight Glimmer,"Great. Now, Rainbow Dash<U+0097>"
Fluttershy,"It might depend on the animal. For instance, this poor little eagle with a sprained wing might be better off up in one of the towers."
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure."
Fluttershy,And these adorable little chipmunks might prefer a nook somewhere. Maybe if you spend some time getting to know<U+0097>
Starlight Glimmer,"In a minute, Fluttershy."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, I don't know if we can chillax properly in the castle. We need very specific conditions for optimal chillaxing."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, I just assumed chillaxing could happen anywhere."
Rainbow Dash,Heh. Shows what you know about chillaxing. Let me do some location scouting.
Starlight Glimmer,"Okay... It seemed more efficient to start with the scrapbooking, so we can just get it out of the<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh! Can we start with me? We're gonna need time for the cake to bake! After all... It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, we're on a schedule, no time for a song. We can start with baking, then<U+0097>"
Rarity,But we can't design dresses after you've been baking with Pinkie. [hushed] She can be a bit messy.
Pinkie Pie,Mmm!
Starlight Glimmer,"Fine. We can start with the dresses, and then<U+0097>"
Applejack,"While y'all figure that out, I'm gonna start layin' out the pictures for scrapbookin'. We got a whole lot of time to cover."
Starlight Glimmer,How much is a whole lot?
Applejack,We've got at least eighty moons worth of memories to go through.
Starlight Glimmer,Eighty moons?!
Rainbow Dash,Ugh. There is nowhere to chillax in this castle! We're gonna have to set up somewhere else.
Starlight Glimmer,Could you all excuse me for... one... second?
Rainbow Dash,Wow. That pony really needs to chillax.
Starlight Glimmer,"[hyperventilating] Okay, Starlight. You've got this. A handful of friendship lessons is nothing compared to the spells you've mastered. [nervous laugh] Maybe if I cast a little spell to help things along... Something simple and safe. Fiducia Compelus... That's not bad. They would barely notice it, but... is it enough? Oh... Maybe Cogeria so they're more... open to suggestion. Oh, or maybe Cogeria combined with Fiducia Compelus! Yes, that could work nicely! Oh, with a hint of Persuadere to be sure it sticks."
Starlight Glimmer,Everypony'll probably thank me for getting it all done so quickly. And Twilight will be thrilled I've completed so many lessons. Everypony wins!
Starlight Glimmer,"Congratulations, Starlight. You're a genius. [gasps] Maybe the congratulations were a little premature..."
Starlight Glimmer,Cogeria... Persuadere... Fiducia... Hmm. Ah! Of course! Fiducia Compelus needs a trigger. [amplified] Ponies! Hear my voice and listen!
Starlight Glimmer,"Pinkie, kitchen. Rarity, Applejack, library. Fluttershy, stay here. Rainbow Dash, find somewhere inside the castle and set up a place where we can chillax."
Starlight Glimmer,"Let's get to work, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie,[mechanically] Okie-dokie! What would you like to do first?
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, what are we supposed to do first?"
Pinkie Pie,"[mechanically] Whatever you want to do first, Starlight Glimmer."
Starlight Glimmer,"[reading] In a medium-size mixing bowl, beat together eggs, sugar, and two teaspoons of vanilla... [beat] mix in flour... [beat] [quickly] add baking soda, salt and cinnamon! Hmm. I think you can take it from here."
Pinkie Pie,[mechanically] Take what from where?
Starlight Glimmer,The baking. Just keep following the instructions in the book until I get back.
Pinkie Pie,[mechanically] Abso-tively! Instruction following starting... now!
Starlight Glimmer,Baking a cake <U+0096> check! Now on to sewing!
Starlight Glimmer,"What did you have in mind, Rarity?"
Rarity,"[mechanically] Whatever you want me to have in my mind, Starlight Glimmer."
Starlight Glimmer,Can you make a dress exactly like that one?
Rarity,[mechanically] Just like this one?
Starlight Glimmer,Just like it.
Rarity,[mechanically] Absolutely. It will look perfectly divine.
Starlight Glimmer,That's a whole lot of photos. How do you usually organize them?
Applejack,"[mechanically] However you want me to organize them, Starlight."
Starlight Glimmer,Okay. Tell me about this one.
Applejack,"[mechanically] Sweet Apple Acres, twenty moons ago. Granny Smith was lookin' for her favorite pie tin. She looked in the kitchen, but it wasn't there. She looked in the barn, but it wasn't there."
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh. I don't need every little detail. Heh. Just sum up the story in one sentence.
Applejack,[mechanically] Huh. Turns out Granny Smith didn't know how to make a pig do the backstroke.
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh-huh... Why don't you keep putting these photos in chronological order, and when I come back, you can give me more... highlights?"
Applejack,"[mechanically] Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer."
Starlight Glimmer,"Fluttershy, where are all the animals?"
Fluttershy,[mechanically] They ran away.
Starlight Glimmer,And why didn't you stop them?
Fluttershy,[mechanically] Because you didn't ask me to.
Starlight Glimmer,Obviously I wanted you to... Never mind. Can you please round up all the animals in the castle and bring them back here to the foyer?
Fluttershy,[mechanically] All the animals. Got it.
Starlight Glimmer,"Did you find a place to chillax, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,"[mechanically] Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer!"
Starlight Glimmer,Great. Let me know when it's ready.
Rainbow Dash,"[mechanically] Yes, Starlight Glimmer."
Applejack,"[mechanically] Granny Smith knew she was gonna need a bigger boat, so Goldie Delicious says, ""If you can't say anythin' nice about anypony, come sit by me!"" Big Mac knew if he just covered himself in mud, the creature wouldn't be able to see him!"
Rarity,[mechanically] Starlight Glimmer. I have finished the dress. Isn't it gorgeous?
Starlight Glimmer,What is that?
Rarity,[mechanically] You wanted me to make a dress exactly like the one in the book.
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] Go make a real dress out of fabric, exactly like the one in the book."
Rarity,"[mechanically] Ah. I see. Yes, of course, Starlight Glimmer."
Starlight Glimmer,Rarity! Make it bigger than the one in the book.
Rarity,"[mechanically] Of course, darling. Bigger it is."
Applejack,[mechanically] She was just a pony standin' in front of another pony askin' him to love her.
Starlight Glimmer,"Pinkie, what are you doing?!"
Pinkie Pie,"[mechanically] Following all of the instructions in the cookbook in order, Starlight Glimmer!"
Starlight Glimmer,I meant just the one cake! I was only gone a few minutes! How in Equestria did you get all of this done so fast?
Starlight Glimmer,Think the baking lesson is done.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, what now?"
Applejack,"[mechanically] They can take our farm, but they can't take our freedom!"
Starlight Glimmer,What's going on?!
Fluttershy,"[mechanically] I gathered all of the animals like you asked, Starlight Glimmer."
Rarity,"[mechanically] Oh, yes, this will do nicely."
Rarity,[mechanically] A much bigger dress!
Applejack,"[mechanically, muffled] It was the best of apples, it was the worst of apples..."
Starlight Glimmer,"[exhales] I can handle this. It's just magic, and I know magic. What's that?!"
Starlight Glimmer,What did you say?
Pinkie Pie,[mechanically] The cakes are burning. You left the ovens on.
Starlight Glimmer,We need water!
Rainbow Dash,"[mechanically] Yes, Starlight Glimmer."
Starlight Glimmer,Storm clouds?!
Applejack,"[mechanically] Big Mac told me, ""With a whole lot of power comes a heck of a lot of responsibility."""
Starlight Glimmer,[groans] This can't get any worse!
Twilight Sparkle,What is going on?!
Spike,I had no idea we had spiders in the castle! I'm never sleeping again!
Starlight Glimmer,Maybe if I had reversed the Fiducia Compelus and Cogeria... Or maybe I added too much Persuadere... What?
Spike,You're really missing the point here.
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] I finally untangled that mess of a spell and got everypony home. It was really powerful stuff. They're gonna feel that in the morning. Now please try to explain to me how in the name of Celestia things got this out of control.
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, it was the first time I cast that particular spell, and I didn't fully think it through. I-I bet if I had reversed<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,I think you might be missing the point here.
Spike,Told ya.
Twilight Sparkle,What made you think that casting a spell on your friends to do your bidding was even remotely a good idea?
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad."
Twilight Sparkle,That's because it is really bad!
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, I'm not mad at you, but I am disappointed. You've been doing so well. I just don't understand how a friendship lesson turned into all of this."
Starlight Glimmer,"Ugh, fine! I've been avoiding the friendship lessons on purpose."
Twilight Sparkle,Why?
Starlight Glimmer,"I can cast complex spells, but baking a cake with Pinkie Pie freaks me out! And yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds. That's why I didn't say anything. I thought if I just kept wowing you with my magical abilities, you might just... not... notice?"
Twilight Sparkle,Baking a cake freaks you out?
Starlight Glimmer,"Yes! Baking a cake, sewing <U+0096> all of it! What if I was bad at it? I didn't want to be a disappointment to anypony, and I ended up being a disappointment to everypony."
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, do you think anypony cares if you can bake a cake?"
Starlight Glimmer,But the lesson<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,"Was to get to know Pinkie Pie better by doing something she loves. It was a friendship lesson, not a baking lesson."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh. You know, I think I might have missed the point here."
Spike,Told ya.
Starlight Glimmer,So now what?
Twilight Sparkle,Now it's time for a pretty advanced friendship lesson. It's called apologizing.
Applejack,"[groaning] I don't know what kind of whammy Starlight put on us, but I feel like I got shoved through the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000."
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, tell me about it."
Rarity,"[hushed] If everypony could speak in a whisper for the next few days, that would be delightful. My head is thumping...!"
Fluttershy,[tired] I was up all night calming the animals down.
Rarity,"[hushed] Fluttershy, please! Not so loud..."
Pinkie Pie,Starlight's spell made me burn perfectly good cake! I never burn cake!
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah, about that... Things got a little out of hand last night."
Applejack,"Well, ain't that the understatement of the day."
Pinkie Pie,"Hmph! Tell it to the cake, sister!"
Rarity,[hushed] Can we all please argue at a lower volume?
Starlight Glimmer,I really messed up. I cast the spell because I was nervous about working with you on the friendship lessons.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, here's a friendship lesson for ya <U+0097> don't cast spells on your friends!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Believe me, I know. What I did was wrong, a-and I can't take it back. You're right to be upset, and I hope one day I can make it up to you. But all I can say is... I'm sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go clean the castle covered in wet cake batter and spiders."
Rainbow Dash,That was a pretty good apology.
Fluttershy,Seems like she feels pretty bad.
Applejack,"Hey, Starlight! Most of the Apple family photos are still layin' around in the wreckage. I think I'll come along and hunt 'em down."
Fluttershy,"Oh, and I feel awful for disturbing all of those cute little spiders and bats. I should check on them."
Rarity,"Ah, yes, and I left some lovely fabric out. I should come and move it to that nice quiet library."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, I'll come and get those storm clouds out of the bathroom."
Pinkie Pie,Fine! Somepony has to bake a cake to honor all the poor cakes that sacrificed their batter in last night's tragedy!
Twilight Sparkle,It seems your apology went well.
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] I'm just lucky to have such understanding friends, but it's probably going to be a while before I try to tackle those friendship lessons again."
Twilight Sparkle,What do you mean? You've been doing them all day.
Starlight Glimmer,What are you talking about? I've been cleaning up the mess I made by totally failing at friendship.
Twilight Sparkle,Really? But didn't I see you sewing with Rarity?
Starlight Glimmer,"Yes, but<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"And you and Applejack did a great job collecting those photos and putting them in the book. Helping animals with Fluttershy, baking with Pinkie Pie <U+0096> those sound like your assignments to me. In fact, I think there's just one that you're missing."
Starlight Glimmer,"Sun <U+0096> check. Chairs <U+0096> check. And thanks to a simple Catadupa Levitata spell, we've got water. Is that everything we need to chillax?"
Rainbow Dash,Nope.
Starlight Glimmer,No? What did I miss?
Rainbow Dash,Quiet.
Starlight Glimmer,Ah! Right.
Rainbow Dash,Hey! She completes the lesson when I say she completes it. So less learning and more chillaxing!
Starlight Glimmer,So... How long do we sit quietly?
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, Spike. It's just Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack are getting back from their Seaward Shoals boat trip, and I can't wait to hear all about it! It's such a shame Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to miss it for their Cloudsdale flight school reunion. Maybe the rest of us not going was for the best anyway. I know the three of them were really looking forward to getting out of their element."
Spike,Getting out of their element?
Twilight Sparkle,I think they all just wanted to try something new.
Spike,Huh. I guess a boat trip qualifies as that.
Twilight Sparkle,"My only worry is that they'll be so excited, they'll talk over each other, and I'll miss some of the details! Just to be safe, I may need you to take notes."
Spike,Uh... right.
Twilight Sparkle,So how was the trip?
Spike,"Well, at least you don't have to worry about them talking over each other."
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know what happened on that boat trip. But once Rarity, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie have some tea and talk it out, I'm sure everypony will feel better."
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on in, everypony! Gummy, Opalescence, and Winona? This is a surprise!"
Spike,"Aren't Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack with you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""Sorry, darling, but I must decline the invitation to your soiree. While I'm sure it will be positively resplendent, there are certain ponies I'd rather not associate with at the moment. Rarity."""
Spike,Rarity's not coming? Awww. So I polished my scales for nothing.
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""Sorry I can't make it, but I'm still a mite upset about everything that happened on the boat. Applejack."" ""Sorry I can't make the tea party today, but there's a small problem with the guest list. Plus, I'm right in the middle of a very important cupcake. Pinkie."" Come on, Spike! Since our friends won't come here and tell us what happened, we'll just have to go to them!"
Rarity,"I'm sorry, but my mane wasn't made to support marine life! Ruined, completely ruined."
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know, Rarity. Maybe you could<U+0097>"
Rarity,"Throw it away? Yes, I agree. Just another innocent casualty of that disastrous boat trip."
Twilight Sparkle,About that. Spike and I were wondering what happened out there.
Spike,"If it's too difficult to talk about, we completely understand."
Rarity,"Well, since you dragged it out of me... It all started at the docks. I knew Applejack and Pinkie Pie wanted to get out of their element, so I thought I would surprise them with an elegant cruise."
Rarity,"[narrating] I had brought a small bag with just a few key essentials. [in-world] All right, ponies! Prepare yourselves for luxury on the high seas!"
Pinkie Pie,That sounds... fun?
Applejack,[sea dog accent] The sea air carries a portent for trouble this day. 'Tis a treacherous and perilous journey that lies ahead of us! We sail to adventure... or our very doom.
Rarity,"I... have no idea what you just said, but your wardrobe is delightfully seaworthy."
Rarity,"[narrating] Despite Applejack's colorful seafarer attitude, I was still determined to get my friends out of their element by providing them with all the refinements of a luxury cruise. I made sure to bring the most delectable nibbles for them to enjoy."
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, I brought food too!"
Pinkie Pie,"Let's see, I've got cotton candy, taffy, circus peanuts, and lots of other super-yummy stuff!"
Rarity,"Oh, Pinkie Pie, that all looks positively delectable. But you simply must try one of these cucumber sandwiches. Dig in!"
Pinkie Pie,Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
Applejack,[sea dog accent] Arrr! Get those off me ship!
Rarity,Oh! I'm so sorry! I had no idea you had such distaste for cucumbers!
Applejack,"[sea dog accent] Yar-har-har-har, hardy-har-har-har!"
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm... That doesn't sound like Applejack.
Spike,Huh.
Rarity,"Well, hold on, because it gets even worse. Pinkie tried to lighten the mood with some fun maritime games."
Pinkie Pie,"It's pi<f1>ata o'clock! Wanna give it a whack, Rarity?"
Rarity,"Oh, darling, of course!"
Applejack,[laughs in sea dog accent] I'll be chartin' a course to the very heart of that maelstrom!
Rarity,"Ahem. Er, Applejack? Just a thought, but maybe we should steer the ship toward calmer waters."
Applejack,[sea dog accent] This be the only way to Plunder Cove!
Rarity,"Perhaps if I took a quick look-see at that map of yours, I could find us a more cruise-friendly path<U+0097>"
Applejack,[sea dog accent] Yah! There'll be no mutiny aboard me ship!
Pinkie Pie,Look at me! I'm the captain too!
Rarity,"[narrating] Clearly, Pinkie Pie had caught Applejack's sea madness."
Spike,Then what happened?!
Twilight Sparkle,So Applejack got some sort of sea madness and caused the boat to capsize?
Rarity,"After all the effort I put in to provide her and Pinkie with the exact luxury cruise they needed to get out of their elements, that is how Applejack thanked me!"
Spike,So you were stuck out in the middle of the ocean? How in Equestria did you get back?
Rarity,"[sighs] Spike, darling, you'll have to forgive me. I am far too emotionally drained to discuss the matter any further!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, I don't suppose there's any chance you might be... uh, exaggerating things? Just a little?"
Rarity,"Well! I can assure you that that is exactly what happened! But if you don't believe me, you can ask Pinkie Pie. I'm quite certain her story will be the same."
Pinkie Pie,"So that's what Rarity said happened on the boat, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,We thought there was a chance she might have... [clears throat] embellished the story just a tad. So we wanted to hear about what happened from you! Did Applejack really capsize the boat?
Pinkie Pie,"Of course not! Pfft, that's just silly! There's no way Applejack could've sank the boat!"
Twilight Sparkle,I knew it!
Spike,That's a relief.
Pinkie Pie,Because Rarity did!
Twilight Sparkle and Spike,What?!
Pinkie Pie,"It all started on the docks. I knew Rarity and Applejack wanted to get out of their element, so I figured I'd throw them the funnest, silliest boat party ever! But I guess Rarity had other ideas."
Pinkie Pie,[narrating] I thought I overpacked until I saw Rarity and her team of porter-ponies!
Rarity,"Prepare yourselves for a luxury cruise! A day of opulence, decadence, and extravagance!"
Pinkie Pie,[deadpan] That sounds fun.
Applejack,"Ahoy, mateys! Batten down the hatches, y'all, 'cause this here's gonna be a boat ride of adventure!"
Pinkie Pie,"Eh, I can live with that."
Pinkie Pie,Huh. They just keep coming.
Pinkie Pie,"[narrating] Now, you can't throw a silly boat party without snacks. So I made sure to pack the funnest party food I could find! [in-world] Rarity, would you care for some cotton candy? It's freshly spun!"
Rarity,"Oh, Pinkie Pie, those all look simply... well, simple. But they're obviously unfit for a luxury cruise. Now, my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof... Try one, then you'll understand."
Applejack,"Ooh, are those chocolate chip?"
Rarity,Sorry! Cucumber sandwiches are so ten seconds ago.
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait, wait, wait. That doesn't sound like Rarity."
Pinkie Pie,Just wait until you hear how much more unlike her she sounds!
Pinkie Pie,I thought I'd lighten the mood with some super-fun party boat games. But Rarity was a real wet blanket.
Pinkie Pie,"It's pi<f1>ata time! Ooh! Wanna give it a whack, Rarity?"
Rarity,"[exaggerated posh laugh] ...Oh. You were serious. Well, that's adorable."
Applejack,I'll give it a go!
Pinkie Pie,That's the spirit! Let's get this boat party started!
Applejack,"Whoooooa! Heh-heh! Whoa, doggie!"
Pinkie Pie,Tug of war? Now we're talking! Whoever wins gets to be captain!
Pinkie Pie,Or... one of us should just be captain now?
Rarity,"Oh, don't worry, dear. Luxury cruises never sink."
Pinkie Pie,What?!
Pinkie Pie,And that's why the boat sinking was all Rarity's fault.
Twilight Sparkle,"That seems... odd. I mean, we trust you, of course. But it's all so... extraordinary?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, it's ""extraordinary"", all right. But that's exactly what happened! In fact, the only thing I might've gotten wrong was that there were even more porter ponies! But just to be safe, you should talk to Applejack. She'll know exactly how many porter ponies there were!"
Spike,"Okay, but if the boat sank, how did you all get rescued?"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, that's easy. We just<U+0097> [sniffs] My muffins!"
Spike,[fed up] That's it. We've gotta go talk to Applejack.
Twilight Sparkle,Good idea. She'll straighten this out.
Spike,"I just really, really wanna know how they made it back! But yeah, that'd be great too."
Applejack,"Hold on a tick. Pinkie Pie says it's Rarity's fault, and Rarity says I sank the boat? Well, that's plumb crazy! If you two really wanna know what happened, I'll tell you. Y'all know how Pinkie Pie and Rarity wanted to get out of their ""element""? Well, I bought a treasure map to give 'em a rip-roarin' seafarin' adventure! But they had other ideas."
Rarity,La-la-la! Prepare yourselves for the most luxurious boat outing that ever outed a boat!
Pinkie Pie,And more fun than you can shake a stick at! [squee] Because I brought a stick!
Applejack,"Alright, mateys, but just y'all wait 'til you see the high seas adventure I've got planned!"
Applejack,"[narrating] Unfortunately, they seemed less interested in a treasure huntin' adventure and more interested in snacks."
Rarity,"Oh, darling, that food isn't fit for a pony of proper breeding, darling, and refinement, darling! Now my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof..."
Pinkie Pie,Bet you I can fit them all in my mouth! Ahh...
Rarity,"Pinkie, darling, please!"
Applejack,"U-uh, Rarity, I<U+0097>"
Rarity,"Well, I never! Hum-ph!"
Pinkie Pie,Me neither! Hum-ph!
Twilight Sparkle,"Do you want to say it, or should I?"
Spike,I'll go. That sure doesn't sound like Rarity or Pinkie Pie!
Applejack,"Oh, it gets a sight worse than that!"
Pinkie Pie,It's P.W.T. <U+0096> Pi<f1>ata Whacking Time!
Rarity,"Oh, darling, whacking is a base pastime for common ponies. Doesn't interest me in the least."
Pinkie Pie,Meh. Hee-hee!
Applejack,Huh?
Applejack,Whoooooa!
Applejack,Looks like we need to change course!
Rarity,"Ooh! Why, this will make a perfect tablecloth for my cheeseboard!"
Applejack,"Maybe so, but it's also the only way to find Plunder Cove!"
Applejack,[narrating] And Pinkie Pie was just about as helpful as a weasel in a hen house.
Pinkie Pie,Captain Pinkie Pie reporting for map duty!
Applejack,"Hold on, everypony!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait, so it was Rarity and Pinkie's fault?"
Applejack,"Yup! And maybe if they ever apologized, I'll consider talkin' to them again."
Spike,"If they all blame each other, I don't know how we're gonna get them to talk again."
Twilight Sparkle,"Neither do I, Spike. Neither do I."
Twilight Sparkle,"There's gotta be some way to fix this. If Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity keep not talking to each other, they could forget what good friends they really are!"
Spike,I just don't get it! All of their stories are so different! [sigh] We're never gonna figure out what really happened.
Twilight Sparkle,"Their stories were different, but they also had a lot in common."
Spike,"I guess... They were all on a ship that sank, and... that's about it."
Twilight Sparkle,Not quite.
Twilight Sparkle,"A-ha! Not only do I think I know how the boat sank, I have a pretty good idea how to get Rarity, Applejack and Pinkie Pie back together!"
Spike,I hope this plan of yours works.
Applejack,[panting] Winona brought me your note about a friendship emergency! H-How can I help?
Rarity,"[panting] Opalescence delivered your message, Twilight! What's the emergency?"
Pinkie Pie,"It's a good thing it was time for Gummy's bath, or I might not have seen your note about the emergency, Twilight!"
Others,"Applejack, Pinkie Pie, What's she doing here?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, but I just didn't know how else to get the three of you here together, and there really is a friendship emergency! Yours!"
Applejack,"Oh, there's no emergency! I'm just waitin' for an apology."
Rarity,An apology?!
Pinkie Pie,What?! Why would you want me to apologize when it was Rarity's fault?!
Rarity,What are you talking about? Applejack clearly caused the boat to sink! She stranded us in the middle of the ocean!
Spike,[frustrated scream] Will somepony please tell me how you made it back?!
Rarity,Well... Maybe it wasn't the middle of the ocean...
Spike,Ugh.
Applejack,"Even so, I don't appreciate bein' hornswoggled into comin' back here."
Rarity,"On that, at least, we agree."
Pinkie Pie,Yeah!
Twilight Sparkle,"I know you each have a different perspective on how the boat capsized and blame each other, but if you come on the boat with me I'll show you what really happened."
Rarity,"Well, not that I have any doubts, but it will feel good for everypony to see exactly whose fault it was."
Applejack,I think we all know which pony's about to be proven right.
Pinkie Pie,We sure do.
Spike,"Like I said, I sure hope this works."
Spike,"[nervous laugh] [hushed] Whatever you're looking for, I hope you find it soon!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, Spike. I've got it all under control. [to the others] While all of your stories seem very different, they all had something in common <U+0096> cucumber sandwiches."
Applejack,What in the hay does that have to do with anythin'?
Rarity,And why would you waste a perfectly good hors d'oeuvre?
Twilight Sparkle,You also mentioned the bubbling water.
Twilight Sparkle,"And the swell. Cucumber just happens to be the favorite food of the tri-horned bunyip, and bubbles followed by a swell is what happens when they swim up to the shallows from deep water."
Applejack,So... we attracted a tri-horned whatchamacallit?
Rarity,With cucumber sandwiches?
Pinkie Pie,Sounds like a stretch.
Twilight Sparkle,"Hello, bunyip, sir!"
Rarity,So that's a...
Twilight Sparkle,A tri-horned bunyip! Who's very sorry he accidentally knocked over your boat. Right?
Pinkie Pie,"Wait, the storm had nothing to do with the capsizing?"
Twilight Sparkle,Nope!
Rarity,"All right. Even if our friend the bunyip is responsible for sinking the boat, it still doesn't excuse a certain pony's behavior!"
Applejack,Me?! How about you and Pinkie Pie?
Pinkie Pie,Pfft<U+0096> What? Who? Me? No<U+0096>
Twilight Sparkle,"I think I can explain that too. Each of you spent so much time trying to come up with the perfect way to get the others out of their element, that you didn't notice your friends were doing the same thing!"
Applejack,Wait a minute. You brought all those games and things for us?
Pinkie Pie,Of course! I figured the boat trip was the perfect time to do things that were silly and fun!
Rarity,And I was just trying to give the two of you the elegant cruise I thought you deserved.
Applejack,"And I just wanted to give you two a high seas adventure, since that'd be somethin' new and different for y'all."
Others,"Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Ohhhh."
Rarity,That is so sweet. You must have gone through so much trouble.
Applejack,"Well, not half as much trouble as you did makin' all that fancy food, and bringin' all those games!"
Twilight Sparkle,I guess this just teaches us that even long time friends need to work at communication.
Pinkie Pie,"Well, there's something I'd like to communicate to you all right now! You girls are the best friends a pony could ever have!"
Rarity,"Oh, let's never fight again!"
Pinkie Pie,You got it!
Applejack,[simultaneously] Agreed!
Applejack,"All right, you big softie! Bring it in!"
Pinkie Pie,"Come on, bunyip, sir! You got it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"One thing's for sure, Spike. There's nothing like a luxurious adventure boat party to get you out of your element."
Spike,You said it!
Applejack,"Well, that's the last of it, Filthy Rich."
Filthy Rich,"Just Rich, please. And on behalf of Rich's Barnyard Bargains, thanks for another season's shipment of zap apple jam."
Applejack,Our pleasure. See ya next time.
Applejack,"Uh, Apple Bloom, did you pack up the cider into the same crates as the zap apple jam?"
Apple Bloom,"Sure did! Now that I'm gettin' older, I wanna prove I can handle more responsibility on the farm."
Applejack,"But the crates aren't marked. You kept track of what went into which crate, right?"
Apple Bloom,Oh. Um... y-yep. I totally kept track of everything.
Applejack,Good. Because we wouldn't want Filthy Rich to get a shipment of cider when he's supposed to get zap apple jam. You know how Granny feels about sellin' cider anywhere but on the farm. Are you sure he got the right crates?
Apple Bloom,[huffs] Sure I'm sure! Now why don't you and Big Mac head on out to the house and let me finish up here?
Applejack,"If you gave Rich the zap apple jam, then what's this here?"
Apple Bloom,Um... extra?
Big McIntosh,Nnnope.
Filthy Rich,"Granny knows I-I wasn't tryin' to make off with a shipment of cider, right? Because I would never do that."
Applejack,Don't worry. We know exactly whose fault it was.
Applejack,"Now why in tarnation would you lie to me, Apple Bloom?"
Apple Bloom,I was kinda hopin' I could fix it before anypony found out.
Applejack,Tellin' lies won't fix anythin'. Trust me. I know.
Apple Bloom,What could you possibly know about it? You've never told a lie in your whole life!
Apple Bloom,What's so funny?
Granny Smith,"Oh-ho, sugarcube. [laughing] Your big sister lied so much when she was a filly, the whole family ended up in the hospital."
Apple Bloom,What?!
Big McIntosh,[laughing] Eeyup!
Applejack,[groans] You might as well tell her the whole story. Might even do her some good.
Granny Smith,"When Applejack and Big Mac were just a wee bit older than you are now, they both kept a-squabblin' over who would run the farm better."
Young Applejack,"All I'm sayin' is that you may have plenty of brawn, but I'm the one with the ideas on how to run things better around here!"
Young Big McIntosh,"[laughs] Applejack, Applejack, Applejack, ideas are all well and good, but you can't plow a field with 'em. I don't know how many times I've told you that."
Young Applejack,Too many!
Granny Smith,"You two horned toads better stop jabberin' and get to workin'! Yeah, they'd better. I need you to go to town. The apple blight's been awful, and if we don't get more spray, cider season'll be shorter than a dwarf crabapple tree!"
Young Big McIntosh,It's like I was just tellin' Cousin Braeburn last week. Now there's a pony who knows how to put his back into a problem...
Young Applejack,"[growls] Oh, hey there, Filthy Rich!"
Filthy Rich,"Just Rich, please. And I'd you to meet my fianc<e9>e, Spoiled Milk. Honey, this is Applejack and Big Mac, the two hardest workin' ponies at Sweet Apple Acres."
Spoiled Milk,You work on a farm? How... quaint.
Filthy Rich,"[chuckles] Oh, now, dear, be nice. Sweet Apple Acres makes zap apple jam. It's one of Dad's best-sellers."
Spoiled Milk,"You mean one of your best-sellers. [to AJ and Big Mac] My amazing husband-to-be is running the Rich family business now. Did you know that? Well, now you do."
Filthy Rich,"[chuckles] Don't mind Spoiled Milk. She's just proud of me. Uh, but she's right. I'm in charge of the store now, and I'm just burstin' with ideas I wanna try!"
Young Applejack,Like what?
Filthy Rich,"Well, how 'bout this? Cider season's around the corner. Why not let me sell it for ya?"
Young Applejack,That is an interesting idea.
Young Big McIntosh,"Well, maybe it's interestin', an' maybe it ain't. But it's definitely not a new idea. Granny Smith told us your grandpa, Stinkin' Rich, used to ask her every year if he could sell our cider in your store, and Granny told him every year about the tradition of everypony in Ponyville linin' up out at Sweet Apple Acres."
Filthy Rich,"So start a new tradition. Some day, one o' y'all will take over the farm just like I've taken over the store. I'm guessin' it'll the one with the best ideas."
Young Big McIntosh,"Well, now, as I've said many a time before, ideas are all well an' good, but you can't plow a field<U+0097>"
Young Applejack,"Ya know what? How 'bout we give you three barrels of cider early, and if it sells well, we'll make a deal for the rest?"
Filthy Rich,"Oh, hey, now! Perfect! [to Spoiled Milk] Come on, honey. I've gotta get everything ready."
Young Applejack,"Hoo-wee! I tell ya, if the future means me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres and you bein' quiet, I can't wait!"
Young Big McIntosh,I just can't believe you'd make a deal with Filthy Rich without even talkin' to Granny!
Young Applejack,"Aw, Granny will love the idea. And then she'll decide that I'm the one who should take over the farm. You'll see."
Granny Smith,See what?
Young Big McIntosh,"Applejack here had another one of her ""big ideas"", and I think we all know my position on ideas. You can't<U+0097>"
Granny Smith and Young Applejack,"""Can't plow a field with 'em."""
Young Big McIntosh,Ee... right.
Granny Smith,"Big idea, hmmm?"
Young Applejack,"Actually, more of an opportunity. Y'see, we ran into Filthy Rich in town. Did ya know he's runnin' the family store now?"
Granny Smith,"And what does this here ""opportunity"" mean for Sweet Apple Acres?"
Young Applejack,"Well, uh, since cider season is almost here, he<U+0097>or, I-I mean, I<U+0097>thought it'd be a good idea to give him a few barrels of cider to sell at the store before the season starts."
Granny Smith,"Oh, is that all? Absolutely not!"
Young Applejack,"[scoffs] But, Granny, why can't we sell a few barrels o' cider early to Filthy Rich? And how is it any different than when you gave zap apple jam to Filthy's grandpappy to sell?"
Granny Smith,"Your cider and your jam ain't the same thing! Zap apple jam jars preserve the flavor for moons, but cider starts to spoil the second it comes out the press. That is why every cider season, all of Ponyville lines up at Sweet Apple Acres. And first come is first served! Hmph!"
Young Applejack,"I get what you're sayin', Granny. But couldn't you make an exception just this once? I sort of promised."
Granny Smith,"Mm, meh-enh. Besides, cider-makin' is iffy business. And we're probably not gonna have a lot this year anyway, what with all the blight. I am sorry, Applejack, but you's just gonna have to un-promise."
Young Applejack,[sighs] Oh.
Young Big McIntosh,"I hate to say I told you so, Applejack, but<U+0097>"
Young Applejack,You an' I both know you don't hate to say anythin'.
Young Big McIntosh,"Well, I've always thought that the most important thing a pony can do is say exactly what's on his mind to anypony who'll listen, so everypony everywhere always knows everythin' they're thinkin', and<U+0097>"
Young Applejack,And you don't ever have to listen to anypony else.
Young Big McIntosh,What?
Young Applejack,Exactly.
Filthy Rich,"Well, if it ain't my new business partner!"
Young Applejack,"Uh, about the cider, Rich..."
Filthy Rich,Take a look at what I did last night after we made our deal!
Filthy Rich,"Whoo! Ha! Pretty great, huh?"
Young Applejack,"The thing is, I-I don't think I can get you any."
Filthy Rich,"What? Well, I did all this work on your say-so! We shook hooves and everything!"
Young Big McIntosh,"Well, you see, at Sweet Apple Acres, we've always been about quality, and while your basic jam jar'll keep<U+0097>"
Young Applejack,"Plus it's been a tough harvest this year, what with all the blight."
Filthy Rich,"Gah! Sounds to me like you're tryin' to make excuses! Whenever Granddad dealt with Granny Smith, she kept her word! If you can't do that, then maybe our families should stop doin' business together! Altogether!"
Young Big McIntosh,"Now, now, the thing is, Rich, it ain't really up to us. Y'see, Granny's<U+0097>"
Young Applejack,"Uh, sick!"
Filthy Rich,"Wait, Granny's sick? I-I had no idea."
Young Big McIntosh,Ee... yeah. Nopony did.
Young Applejack,"Uh, what Big Mac means is, uh, we've been tryin' to keep it quiet. Don't want people to make rash decisions about doin' business with Sweet Apple Acres just because we're, uh, a little short-hooved at the moment."
Filthy Rich,"Oh, my! O-Of course, of course! I am so sorry. Please let me know if there's anything I can do."
Young Applejack,"Much appreciated. But right now, we-we only ask for your understandin' during this difficult time."
Filthy Rich,Mm-hmm.
Young Big McIntosh,"You were supposed to tell Rich the simple truth! But instead, you made things worse with a giant lie!"
Young Applejack,"W-W-What was I supposed to do? You heard Rich. If I told him the truth, he was gonna stop doin' business with us altogether."
Young Big McIntosh,"Yeah, but that's only because I... I forgot to ask if we had any oat crumbles for this delicious-lookin' salad, Granny."
Young Big McIntosh,[hushed] That was only because you made promises you couldn't keep! But there's gotta be a better way out of this mess than by makin' up some story about Granny bein' sick!
Young Applejack,"[hushed] Well, it worked, didn't it?"
Filthy Rich,Sorry to drop by unannounced. We just wanted to come by to wish Granny a speedy recovery.
Young Big McIntosh,"[sarcastic] Look, sis. Our good friend, Mr. Rich and his fianc<e9>e... are here. Oh, and they brought flowers! For Granny! On account o' she's sick! Like you said. Ain't that sweet?"
Young Applejack,"Uh, excuse me one second!"
Granny Smith,Aah!
Granny Smith,"Golly, what in tarnation?"
Young Applejack,"Oh, I'm sorry, Granny. I-I didn't see ya there."
Granny Smith,"Ya came blastin' in so fast, t'weren't possible to see nothin'!"
Young Applejack,"Can you go out to the barn? I, uh, I think I might've left a blight sprayer in the orchard."
Granny Smith,"Are you outta yer apple-pickin' mind?! It's suppertime, girl!"
Young Applejack,"I know, but, uh, if we forgot a sprayer, I'd wanna get it before dark. You go start countin', a<U+0097>and I'll tell Big Mac we'll be right back, okay?"
Young Big McIntosh,"...so from that moment on, I took to referrin' to myself as Big or Large or..."
Filthy Rich,"Oh, Applejack! Your brother was just explainin' why he always wears his yoke."
Spoiled Milk,Even though we asked him how your grandmare is doing!
Young Applejack,"Oh, well, you know how Big Mac can get to... to talkin', especially when he's upset. And right now, he's just as worried about Granny Smith as I am."
Filthy Rich,"Oh, dear. Is she doin' that bad?"
Young Applejack,"Well, one thing's for sure, she... she shouldn't be seein' anypony right now. In fact, I'm gettin' more upset just thinkin' about it. Excuse me."
Granny Smith,D'oh! What in the frilly fumidil has gotten into you?!
Young Applejack,"Sorry, Granny. I just decided if I helped you, it would go faster."
Granny Smith,"Well, you're too late. All the sprayers are here."
Young Applejack,"Oh, good. Uh, say, Granny, when did you first fight the apple blight again?"
Granny Smith,"It was my second year here in Ponyville. Uh, they was before I had the rick on the one knee."
Young Big McIntosh,"...and others say that's how the trees got to growin' so tall. But to me, it's just how I got my cutie mark!"
Spoiled Milk,But we asked when we could come back to see Granny.
Young Applejack,"Uh, Big Mac didn't wanna be rude, but you just can't see Granny right now, because she's... got apple blight!"
Filthy Rich,[gasps] I thought only trees got the blight!
Young Applejack,"Yeah, that's usually the case. [beat] The doctors think it's from workin' in the orchards for so many years. [beat] Y'see, we had to take Granny to Ponyville General. We just got back right before you showed up."
Filthy Rich,"Oh, my. That is terrible!"
Spoiled Milk,"Ew! It's not contagious, is it?"
Young Applejack,"Um, I'm sure you'll be fine, but you should leave... [coughs] ...just in case."
Filthy Rich,You're right. We're gonna have to hurry if we wanna get there before visitin' hours are over.
Young Applejack,That's right. Wait. Get where?
Filthy Rich,"Why, the hospital, of course. I'm sure we'll see you there."
Young Big McIntosh,Tellin' Filthy Rich that Granny's in the hospital just made everythin' a hundred times worse! What are we supposed to do now?
Young Applejack,I got it!
Granny Smith,"Dropped my second best teeth right in the pigpen, and that was the worst case of apple blight I have ever seen!"
Young Applejack,"I'd love to hear more, Granny, but we gotta get to the hospital right away!"
Granny Smith,The hospital? Why? Who's sick?
Young Big McIntosh,"You are, apparently."
Young Applejack,What he means is you're needed at the hospital.
Granny Smith,Heh. Whatever for?
Young Applejack,"It's the apple blight! It's startin' to infect ponies now! The doctors need an expert opinion, and nopony knows more about fightin' blight than Granny Smith!"
Granny Smith,"Well, what in tarnation are we waitin' for? Let's go!"
Young Applejack,"[gasps] You know, we're supposed to go in, uh, in the back! Uh, to avoid anypony in the waitin' room with the blight."
Young Applejack,Oops! I almost forgot!
Young Big McIntosh,Hrk!
Young Applejack,This is perfect! Now you don't have to worry about catchin' the blight.
Granny Smith,"[slightly muffled] If you say so, dearie."
Young Applejack,"Now you wait right here while I, uh... check on your presentation!"
Granny Smith,What in the rotten rhubarb is goin' on here?
Young Applejack,[nervous laugh] Fancy meetin' you two here!
Spoiled Milk,"Well, we told you we were coming."
Filthy Rich,"Well, I'm glad we found you, because I can't seem to find Granny's room or any nurses who've even heard about a pony with apple blight."
Filthy Rich,"Uh, aren't you comin' with us?"
Young Applejack,"Uh, I'll catch up! I gotta find Big Mac!"
Young Applejack,"Okay, Granny, just wait here one second and we can go."
Granny Smith,Where are you two going?
Young Applejack,"Big Mac can't come! He, uh, might be contagious!"
Young Big McIntosh and Granny Smith,Contagious?!
Young Applejack,"All right, climb up here and I'll cover you up. Then I'll bring Rich in, tell him you're Granny, but you're not allowed to take the sheets off. You moan a few times, he leaves, and this whole thing is over."
Young Big McIntosh,"This is spinnin' way out of control, Applejack! Now I know you thought sellin' cider in Filthy's store was a good idea, but it ain't worth lyin' to him about Granny bein' sick and needin' to go to the hospital, or fibbin' to Granny about them wantin' her come here to talk about the blight, or<U+0097>"
Young Applejack,"Big McIntosh, please just listen to me for once! This ain't about my ideas. If Rich finds out about all the lies, he'll cut off ties with us and the farm'll go under! Now do you want that to happen, or do you wanna help?"
Young Big McIntosh,"Why can't you be Granny? You're her size, and this is all your fault in the first place."
Young Applejack,"I would, but if I let you do the talkin', you'd just ramble on and on until we all got caught!"
Young Applejack,"Just lay down, keep still, and promise me you won't say anythin' for once in your life!"
Young Big McIntosh,[unconvinced] Eeeeyup.
Young Applejack,Granny! [squeaks] [hushed] Granny!
Granny Smith,It's about time! What is goin' on around here?!
Young Applejack,"Uh, Granny, they need you to wait here! I'll come get ya!"
Filthy Rich,[panting] There you are! We've been going in circles looking for Granny's room!
Young Applejack,"Well, you're in luck, 'cause it's-it's right over here, and this time I'll make sure you don't get lost."
Young Applejack,What in the dadgum<U+0097>?!
Spoiled Milk,What now?
Young Applejack,"He<U+0096> I mean, she was right here! Oh, no. We gotta go!"
Spoiled Milk,I-Is that Granny Smith?
Filthy Rich,Where are they takin' her?
Young Applejack,"You two, don't lose that gurney! [hushed] Granny, what are you doin'? You were supposed to stay there!"
Granny Smith,It was a supply closet!
Young Applejack,"Oh. Uh... Well, okay, come with me, but be quiet! You know, save your voice for the big presentation!"
Others,"""Hippocratic Oath"": I-I-I'm sorry, but you can't get any closer without a gown and mask."
Young Applejack,But-but-but-but that's my brother on there!
Others,"""Hippocratic Oath"": Don't worry. This is our best doctor. She'll have your brother back on his hooves in no time."
Granny Smith,Now apple blight is a serious disease!
Masked Pony 2,[splutters] Did she say... apple blight?
Masked Nurse,"I think she said ""gasket mites""."
Granny Smith,"And once your trunk turns red like this, the only thing to do is prune the branches."
Filthy Rich,"[gasps] Oh, no! Granny!"
Masked Nurse,"Did you say...""prune them branches""?"
Granny Smith,"Well, sure! What else you gonna do once the blight gets this bad?"
Young Applejack,"Everypony, just stop! This is all a big misunderstandin'! [pants] Actually... it's a big lie."
Granny Smith,Big Mac?!
Filthy Rich,"[gasps] Granny Smith?! What is goin' on here, Applejack?!"
Granny Smith,That is a darn good question.
Young Applejack,"[sighs] I'm not sure if I was worried that nopony was listenin' to my ideas or just nervous that I wouldn't be the one to end up runnin' the farm, but... I promised somethin' to Filthy Rich that I couldn't deliver, and I was too embarrassed to admit it."
Filthy Rich,So Granny was never sick?
Granny Smith,And there ain't no apple blighted ponies?
Young Big McIntosh,Nnnope.
Young Applejack,"Those were all lies. A-And I thought if you found out, you'd stop doin' business with the farm. So I just kept tellin' more."
Others,"""Hippocratic Oath"": So she's not a doctor?"
Young Applejack,Please don't make Granny and the farm suffer for what I did! This whole thing is my fault.
Young Big McIntosh,"That's... not entirely true. Maybe if I paid more attention to what you had to say instead of talkin' all the time, none o' this would've happened in the first place. I just need to... talk less and listen more. Especially to you."
Young Applejack,"[sighs] Thanks, big brother. And whether it's me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres or you, I know it'll be in good hooves."
Granny Smith,"Well, that's nice, but I don't know what in blazes you two are talkin' about! I ain't goin' anywhere anytime soon! [blows raspberry] Runnin' the farm. Not after this display! Not likely! [to Filthy Rich] And don't you go gettin' any ideas about cuttin' ties with Sweet Apple Acres, or I'm goin' right to your grandpappy. Get me?"
Filthy Rich,"[stutters] Um, yes, ma'am."
Granny Smith,"Now, who here still wants to hear about the apple blight? Now, when I was a filly..."
Apple Bloom,I can't believe you told all those lies!
Applejack,"It's not a story I'm proud of, but it taught me a lifelong lesson about bein' honest. I hope you learned somethin', too."
Apple Bloom,I sure did. I learned that nopony starts out perfect and sometimes you gotta make a few mistakes to figure out who you are.
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,But I think the most important thing I learned is who really runs Sweet Apple Acres.
Others,"Applejack, Apple Bloom, Granny!"
Granny Smith,You're darn tootin'! Now everypony quit your lollygaggery and get back to work! Right after we have a glass of cider.
Rainbow Dash,"Spring training was awesome, but I can't wait to see my friends!"
Rainbow Dash,"I'm gonna catch up on some Daring Do with Twilight, help Applejack make my favorite cider, and have a sleepover with Pinkie!"
Misty Fly,We get it. You have a fun week planned.
Spitfire,"Meanwhile, I'm stuck here running trials week at the Academy."
Rainbow Dash,But you love yelling and blowing your whistle.
Spitfire,Yeah. I do.
Rainbow Dash,See you gals later!
Rainbow Dash,"Huh? Oh, the map!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Twilight! So where am I going? The Crystal Mountains? Vanhoover? Here? Please say here."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, the good news is we both got called by the map!"
Rainbow Dash,Awesome! [beat] Does that mean there's bad news?
Twilight Sparkle,"No. Well, not exactly."
Rainbow Dash,[groans] I was just there!
Twilight Sparkle,Ooh!
Rainbow Dash,Ahem.
Spitfire,"All right, newbies! Welcome to trials week for the Wonderbolt Academy! You'll be judged on your speed, strength, agility, and technique, culminating in a final evaluation. Will it be hard? Yes! Will you cry? Maybe. Will you fly so much your wings fall off? That has only happened once."
Angel Wings,"She's just exaggerating to make a point, right? I mean, wings can't really fall off... can they?"
Spitfire,You think you've got what it takes to be an elite flyer?
Sky Stinger,"Yes, ma'am."
Rest of recruits,"Yes, ma'am!"
Spitfire,"Well, lemme tell you. You don't!"
Rainbow Dash,[sighs wistfully] I remember when she said that to me.
Angel Wings,"You don't think Rainbow Dash is the pony whose wings fell off, do you?"
Spitfire,"[blows whistle] Quit your whispering and give me five hundred laps! Go, go, go!"
Angel Wings,"Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my favorite ponies in all of Equestria."
Spitfire,"Well, isn't that sweet? Now get going on those laps!"
Spitfire,"Welcome, Princess Twilight. [to Rainbow Dash] What are you doing back so soon?"
Rainbow Dash,Official friendship business.
Twilight Sparkle,Have you noticed anypony having a hard time with their friends?
Spitfire,"Not really, but it's not my job to worry about their relationships. I'm here to make them elite flyers."
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Adorable. They're so full of hope and competition. Eh, their technique could use some work, though."
Twilight Sparkle,You should tell them. I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you.
Rainbow Dash,Nah. I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence.
Twilight Sparkle,But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on.
Spitfire,"Sloppy wing placement, crooked lines... I'm gonna have to drill them on basic technique in the classroom portion."
Twilight Sparkle,Classroom portion?
Spitfire,"Yeah, it's everypony's least favorite part of trial week, but it has to be done."
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe we can help!
Rainbow Dash,We can?
Twilight Sparkle,"Absolutely! Between your flying skills and my teaching expertise, they could learn a lot! Plus, once they get to know us, they'll be more comfortable coming to us with their friendship problems!"
Rainbow Dash,Count us in!
Spitfire,You have your work cut out for you.
Twilight Sparkle,Thank goodness I had time to whip up a few charts on flight patterns and wing symmetry! It's fresh in my mind from when I learned to fly! This is so exciting!
Twilight Sparkle,I'm pretty sure their thirst for knowledge will keep them bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
Rainbow Dash,"[chuckles] Good one, Twilight."
Rainbow Dash,"Wake up, newbies! Class is in session!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hello, students! I'm Twilight Sparkle, and this is Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,"But you can call us ""T-Sparks"" and ""The Dashinator""!"
Rainbow Dash,[laughs nervously] Just kidding.
Twilight Sparkle,And we're here to go over basic flying technique.
Rainbow Dash,Who said that?!
Sky Stinger,"Me. I mean, we're here because we're amazingly awesome crazy-good flyers. We're way past basics."
Rainbow Dash,What's your name?
Sky Stinger,"Sky Stinger. You've, uh, never heard of me?"
Vapor Trail,He set the record for the fastest vertical acceleration rate! Five hundred feet in two seconds!
Rainbow Dash,[unimpressed] Huh. That's pretty impressive.
Vapor Trail,It's amazing.
Twilight Sparkle,"[clears throat] It is, and we can talk personal records after class, Ms...?"
Sky Stinger,Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony. I never fly without her.
Rainbow Dash,But you'll have to in the solo trials.
Vapor Trail,There are... [gulps] ...solo trials?
Rainbow Dash,Yup. It's a part of your final evaluation.
Sky Stinger,"[scoffs] We'll ace that test with our wings tied behind our flanks. My picture will go right up there, next to yours."
Rainbow Dash,"That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer."
Sky Stinger,I know.
Twilight Sparkle,"[clears throat] Okay! Let's get back on track. Now, who can tell me the best wing angle to achieve minimal air resistance?"
Rainbow Dash,[quickly] Wake up newbies! Class is in session!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, there were a few hiccups, but overall, that went pretty well."
Rainbow Dash,"[cricks neck, yawns] Yeah, nopony fell asleep. What? I'm not a student!"
Sky Stinger,"Hey, Teach!"
Rainbow Dash,Me or Twilight? Probably Twilight.
Sky Stinger,"Um, uh, both. About the solo test. I'm actually kinda worried about it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Aw, that's all right. We all have moments where we doubt ourselves."
Sky Stinger,"No, no. I've absolutely zero doubts about myself. I'm a strong flyer. Like, really, really, really strong. This isn't about me. I'm worried for Vapor."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, well, that is very... kind of you?"
Rainbow Dash,Tell you what. It's almost time for your freestyle training. Why don't you grab her and show us what you got?
Sky Stinger,Yes! Prepare to be impressed!
Sky Stinger,By me.
Sky Stinger,"Like I said, Vapor still needs work."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, he may be full of himself, but I have to admit, Sky is an excellent flyer. He must have shot up two hundred feet!"
Rainbow Dash,But did you see Vapor Trail? Her wing was under his. I think she gave him a boost.
Twilight Sparkle,I guess I didn't even notice Vapor. I was too busy watching Sky.
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] I think you're right! Vapor just created a gust of wind that caught Sky's wing at a forty-five degree angle, propelling him into a flipping loop! [beat] Somepony paid attention in class!"
Rainbow Dash,Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome.
Twilight Sparkle,"And Vapor's so busy making her friend look good, she's not focused on her own flying at all. [gasps] This must be our friendship problem! And there's only one thing to do!"
Twilight Sparkle,You don't want to tell them?
Rainbow Dash,Of course not! Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence! You can't mess with a flyer's confidence!
Twilight Sparkle,"But you can't improve if you don't think you have to! Besides, Vapor's keeping a pretty big secret from Sky, and that could lead to trouble!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too!"
Sky Stinger,"Ah, I nailed that flipping loop. I'm actually surprised you're still here. Thought I blew you away."
Vapor Trail,"[out of breath] You were... great, Sky."
Spitfire,"Come on, Vapor Trail! You're gonna have to build up your endurance if you want a shot at the Academy! Wonderbolts don't get winded! Angel Wings, you call that cloud-busting?! That cloud barely knew you were there! I love my job."
Sky Stinger,"We'll keep working, and who knows? One day, you might come close to being almost as good as me."
Sky Stinger,You do have a really great sneeze.
Vapor Trail,"Thanks, Sky, but I don't think I can sneeze my way into the Academy. [sighs] I'm pretty beat. I'm gonna hit the showers."
Sky Stinger,You have to help her.
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, she's not the one<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,Will do!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, you did great. You're a really strong flyer."
Vapor Trail,"Uh, me?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Vapor Trail, we know what you've been doing."
Rainbow Dash,You've been doing great!
Twilight Sparkle,[groans] You've been helping Sky!
Vapor Trail,"Uh, I don't know what you're talking about! Sky doesn't need anypony's help. He's amazing."
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Not without you. And it's gonna be pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to do a flipping loop.
Vapor Trail,"Oh, no! I can't let that happen! I mean, ah, uh... Aw, sugarcubes!"
Twilight Sparkle,Why are you doing this for him?
Vapor Trail,[sighs] It started when we were kids. You have to understand...
Vapor Trail,"[narrating] ...Sky grew up with a lot of siblings. It was tough. He was always trying to get his parents' attention. Meanwhile, I was an only child who hated all the attention I got from mine."
Others,"""Twirly Whirly"": Vapor Trail! Where are you? Do you need a snack? Do you wanna do homework?"
Others,"""Steer Straight"": Or we can just spend some time together! All day is never enough!"
Young Sky Stinger,"Mom, Dad, I'm here! Look, look, look-look-look-look, hey! Mom, Dad, can you see?"
Young Vapor Trail,"Whoa, that was amazing!"
Vapor Trail,"[narrating] Flying together gave us both what we wanted! But I never told Sky how much I was helping him. It started with a small boost here or a little gust of wind there, but I didn't think my help could actually hurt his chances."
Twilight Sparkle,I understand. But now you're both in trouble!
Rainbow Dash,"You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it."
Vapor Trail,"Oh, but he has to! Flying with the Wonderbolts has been Sky's dream ever since he was a colt!"
Twilight Sparkle,What about you?
Vapor Trail,I... I guess I haven't thought about it. I just want to be with my best friend.
Rainbow Dash,Then we have to find a way to help both of you.
Twilight Sparkle,Starting with telling Sky the truth.
Vapor Trail,"No, you can't! Sky will be crushed! And without his confidence, he won't fly as well!"
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Then I guess we'll give Dash's method a shot.
Rainbow Dash,"Yes! Hah-hah! I love being right! Okay, here's what we do. Sky needs to build his strength. Air drills, wing lifts, all that boring methodical stuff."
Twilight Sparkle,Sounds like my cup of oats.
Vapor Trail,But how will we get him to do that? He doesn't think he needs practice.
Rainbow Dash,We'll just tell Sky that he should practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting special training from me.
Vapor Trail,With you? Really?! You'd do that for me?
Rainbow Dash,Hah. You say that like it's not gonna be a blast.
Vapor Trail,Whooa... Ah!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, you were awesome!"
Vapor Trail,Really? Thanks! I can't believe I was able to keep up!
Rainbow Dash,That's the first nice thing I've heard you say about yourself.
Sky Stinger,"Hey, can we switch now? I want to do tricks with Rainbow Dash!"
Vapor Trail,"You can't! I mean, uh, you're already so good at the fancy stuff!"
Sky Stinger,"Heh. And the basic stuff. [beat] You're right, I don't need to practice at all."
Vapor Trail,"Um, maybe, Sky, you should..."
Sky Stinger,I'm already the best and everypony's gonna know it when I'm asked to join the Academy tomorrow.
Vapor Trail,But not if you don't practice...!
Sky Stinger,"Heh. I wouldn't be surprised if they asked me to become a Wonderbolt straight out of the trials. Boom, dream achieved."
Sky Stinger,What did you say?
Vapor Trail,"[sighs] Sky, I want you to get in as much as anypony, and you're amazing, but..."
Sky Stinger,But what?
Vapor Trail,I've been... helping you.
Rainbow Dash,Gyuh...
Sky Stinger,"[panting] How can you do this to me? Did you all know? Oh, great. So everypony but me knows I'm a joke. Was this your plan the whole time? To embarrass me?"
Vapor Trail,What? No! Don't you know me at all?
Sky Stinger,"I guess not, since it took me this long to find out you're a terrible wingpony!"
Vapor Trail,[gasps] I can't believe you!
Sky Stinger,I can't believe I was ever your friend!
Vapor Trail,Thanks a lot.
Rainbow Dash,Do you think they're still mad?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, they're still mad."
Twilight Sparkle,"This is all my fault. If we'd just done things your way, maybe we could have avoided this whole mess."
Rainbow Dash,"No, it's my fault. It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you. He wasn't even trying!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, no. He's lost his confidence."
Spitfire,Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it."
Rainbow Dash,"[groans] We really messed up, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,I have a plan.
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Sky. I thought I might find you here."
Sky Stinger,"Well, apparently, I need a lot of practice. Guess I'm not the natural I thought I was."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, you're not."
Sky Stinger,[sarcastic] Thanks. Good pep talk.
Twilight Sparkle,"I wasn't a natural at friendship. But with some practice and help from my friends, I got better, and now I'm the Princess of Friendship!"
Sky Stinger,So you're saying I can be the... Princess of Flying?
Rainbow Dash,"You know, you're really good. You're lead pony material."
Vapor Trail,"Hm. That's sweet of you, but no. I couldn't handle all the attention."
Rainbow Dash,"But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine. That is what you want, right?"
Vapor Trail,"Well, not at first. I just wanted to be with Sky. But learning to do all those fun tricks with you? It made me realize this is something I want for myself!"
Rainbow Dash,I was hoping you'd say that. Come with me.
Sky Stinger,What's she doing here?
Rainbow Dash,"Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight. She thought she was helping you."
Twilight Sparkle,"And Vapor, you shouldn't have been so content to take a back seat."
Rainbow Dash,"Now, you can either stay mad, or help each other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has ever seen! [beat] Please pick the second option. I don't want Spitfire to be mad at me."
Vapor Trail,"You got this, Sky!"
Sky Stinger,Focus on a cloud when you spin! It'll help you fly straight when you come out of it!
Vapor Trail,Uh-huh!
Spitfire,Congratulations! You've both made it into the Wonderbolt Academy!
Spitfire,"Whatever you did, it worked. They still have a lot of potential. Who knows? They might even be better than you, Crash."
Rainbow Dash,"[laughing] Okay, let's not get carried away."
Angel Wings,"Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my new favorite ponies in all of Equestria."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, I heard that!"
Vapor Trail,I can't believe we did it!
Sky Stinger,"You were great! Even though you can out-fly me, you can be my wingpony anytime."
Vapor Trail,Aw. [chuckles] And you can be mine.
Twilight Sparkle,Phew. It's good to be home.
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] You're telling me. Now we can finally catch up with some Daring Do, I can make cider with Applejack<U+0097>"
Misty Fly,Dash! I've been looking all over for you! Wonderbolt emergency! We got to get back to HQ.
Spike,"[grunting, yelps] Well, we don't all have magical horns."
Twilight Sparkle,I've been meaning to move these older books to my reference section for a while. Got to keep the new books front and center! Thank you both for your help.
Starlight Glimmer,"Are you kidding? After all you've done for me, this is the least I can do."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, please. I haven't done that much."
Starlight Glimmer,Nah. You just taught me the value of friendship. Not much at all.
Twilight Sparkle,"I may have offered some guidance, but you are responsible for the pony you've become. I'm proud to call you my student and my friend. Now we just need to get rid of these boxes. Spike, can you<U+0097>? Spike?"
Spike,What's that?
Twilight Sparkle,Is it a bird?
Starlight Glimmer,Is it a parasprite?
Spike,It's... it's... incoming!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. I usually get letters by dragon.
Spike,It is the fastest way to get mail!
Starlight Glimmer,For me? Who'd be sending me a letter? It's... the ponies from my old village.
Twilight Sparkle,Are they in danger?
Spike,Are they upset with you?
Starlight Glimmer,No... It's worse! They've invited me to the annual Sunset Festival!
Starlight Glimmer,"[exhales] Uh, hey there, everypony."
Party Favor,"Uh... Hey, Starlight. What are you doing here?"
Starlight Glimmer,I-I... I was invited. To the Sunset Festival?
Double Diamond,"Uh, yeah, but we didn't think you'd actually show up."
Party Favor,"You didn't think we really wanted you here, did you?"
Starlight Glimmer,But... I... apologized. I thought everything was fine.
Starlight Glimmer,Please...! Stop...! Stop!
Starlight Glimmer,What happened? Is anypony there? Princess Luna? W-What are you doing here?
Princess Luna,"Dreams are my domain, Starlight Glimmer. I am here because you need me to be."
Starlight Glimmer,Oh. It's only a dream.
Princess Luna,"It may only be a dream, but the feelings in it are real."
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] Great. So I guess I'm more afraid of going back to the village than I thought. What do I do now?
Princess Luna,"I have been helped time and time again by six very special ponies. They helped me overcome my past. You're fortunate to have them as friends. I suggest you share your concerns with them. I see much of myself in you, Starlight Glimmer, and I can tell you from personal experience that things do indeed get better."
Starlight Glimmer,...and Princess Luna said I should tell you all how I was feeling. So... there it is. I'm afraid to go back to the village for the celebration.
Rarity,"But why, darling? You went back to apologize. They accepted. Everypony has moved on."
Starlight Glimmer,"But have they? They don't really know how much I've changed. Or even worse, maybe I haven't changed as much as I think I have!"
Rainbow Dash,"Trust me. You are a totally different pony now. I mean, you were pretty awful."
Applejack,Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash,What? She was! It's a compliment!
Fluttershy,I don't think they would've sent the invitation if they didn't want you to come. I'm sure they'd be happy to see you.
Pinkie Pie,"And getting an invitation to a party and not going?! That's like... I-It's like...! Well, I don't know what it's like, but it is definitely bad."
Applejack,Just be honest with them. I'm sure they'll understand where you're comin' from.
Twilight Sparkle,"I understand how hard this is for you. Maybe if you took a friend along, it might make things easier. Somepony you trust who would look out for you?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Thanks so much for doing this, Trixie. When Twilight said I should bring a friend, you were the first pony I thought of."
Trixie,"Great idea, Princess Twilight. Asking me <U+0096> Starlight's best friend <U+0096> to help her on this difficult journey really shows how wise a princess you have become."
Twilight Sparkle,"[through gritted teeth] Thanks, Trixie. [hushed, to Spike] I was talking about me."
Starlight Glimmer,"The festival lasts a whole week, but I'm sure we won't stay that long."
Trixie,There it is! The town where you<U+0097>
Starlight Glimmer,"Magically stole everypony's cutie marks, replaced them with equal signs, and forced them all to hide their natural talents? Yes."
Trixie,"I was going to say where you came from, but yours is a more... emotionally traumatic answer."
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] I just want to... blend in. Be just another pony in the crowd enjoying the Sunset Festival with my friend.
Trixie,"Sounds good to me! And if things get weird for you, just let me know. I've got your flank."
Starlight Glimmer,Is that a promise?
Trixie,Not just a promise. A great and powerful promise!
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I couldn't ask for more than that. If we're gonna do this, let's do it."
Double Diamond,"Oh! Starlight, you came!"
Party Favor,We were worried you wouldn't be able to make it! Are you staying the whole week? We have different events planned each day!
Sugar Belle,How is it living in a castle?
Double Diamond,It is so<U+00A0>good to see you!
Starlight Glimmer,"[small groan] It's good to see all of you, too."
Party Favor,"You got here just in time. We were having some debate about these banners. Which do you think feels more ""sunsetty""?"
Starlight Glimmer,"O-Oh, you don't need me to decide that. Heh. Whatever you think is probably best."
Double Diamond,"Uh, well, how about helping us with the routes for the relay races tomorrow? Can you take a look?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, I-I shouldn't. You all go ahead. I-I just want to enjoy the festival."
Sugar Belle,"But you will be a judge for the baking competition, right?"
Double Diamond,We had a few questions about the order of the acts for the talent show.
Night Glider,And the unicorns have a fireworks show planned! We could really use your help!
Trixie,"The Great and Powerful Trixie would like to thank you all for being such an amazing audience. Sadly, it is time for us to depart. Good night, fillies and gentlefoals!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Ugh! I was horrible when I led that town! I was ready for them to not trust me, but... I wasn't ready for them to put me in charge again! With my past, I should never be in charge of anything!"
Trixie,"So you messed up. Big deal. [hushed] Don't you ever tell another pony I said this, but even Trixie's made mistakes. [giggles] I know! The trick is to just move on and pretend they never happened."
Starlight Glimmer,I feel like that's almost good advice.
Starlight Glimmer,"Hey, uh, Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie,Hey... [beat] you!
Starlight Glimmer,So... you're probably wondering why I'm back so soon.
Pinkie Pie,Where were you?
Starlight Glimmer,I... went to my old village? For the festival?
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, sounds fun! How was it?"
Starlight Glimmer,It was kind of a disaster. I came back early because I freaked out!
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, sounds awful! Bye!"
Starlight Glimmer,That was... strange.
Trixie,Isn't she always strange?
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah, but not like that. Hey! I'm back early."
Rarity,Ah. Welcome back?
Starlight Glimmer,Have you two noticed Pinkie acting a little strange?
Applejack,Pinkie Pie always acts strange.
Trixie,Told you.
Starlight Glimmer,"Anyway, I wanted to talk to all of you. Things didn't go the way I thought they were going to go at the Sunset Festival."
Rarity,What happened?
Starlight Glimmer,I kind of freaked out and ran out of the village.
Applejack,You freaked out and ran away from a festival? Ha! That's the funniest danged thing I've heard all day.
Rarity,[laughing] Oh my. Let me guess. The decorations were terrifying!
Fluttershy,[whispering] ...Applejack for friendship business.
Rainbow Dash,"Hello, ponies. We need Rarity and Applejack. Very important friendship business."
Trixie,"I have to say, I'm really not as impressed with your friends as the rest of Equestria is."
Starlight Glimmer,I need to talk to Twilight!
Starlight Glimmer,Twilight? Hello?
Spike,What do you want? Twilight's very busy!
Starlight Glimmer,"Spike, I really need to speak with her."
Spike,"Make an appointment! She's a princess, after all!"
Starlight Glimmer,What's wrong with you? Why are you being so<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,Rude? I think a certain dragon didn't get his nap today.
Spike,"Yeah, right. Whatever."
Twilight Sparkle,Sorry. He's been acting a little off all day. I think he missed a meal or something.
Starlight Glimmer,He's not the only one. Everypony's acting a little strange today.
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, it's definitely been one of those days! How are you?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Not great, actually. You're probably wondering why I'm back from the village so early."
Twilight Sparkle,"I didn't want to bring it up, but yeah, it did seem strange. Did it not go well?"
Starlight Glimmer,"The townsponies kept asking me things, like they expected me to be in charge again. But being a leader is the last thing I should ever be. So we left. Very suddenly. In a literal puff of smoke."
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, you should definitely never go back to that village."
Starlight Glimmer,What?
Twilight Sparkle,"If you were worried about what they thought of you before, it's probably way worse now. I'd cut my losses."
Starlight Glimmer,"That's... surprising advice, coming from you."
Twilight Sparkle,Trust me. I'm the Princess of Friendship. You don't need those ponies. You can always make more friends.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ah! Speaking of friends, if you'll excuse me, important business to attend to!"
Starlight Glimmer,Cut my losses? That can't be right.
Starlight Glimmer,"Hey, I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier. Party Favor, can you hear me?"
Twilight Sparkle,I told you you can never speak to them again!
Starlight Glimmer,What are you all doing here?
Twilight Sparkle,"Making sure you do what I said! I'm your teacher, aren't I? Didn't I say to never come back here?!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Yes, but that just doesn't seem right. You aren't acting like yourself."
Starlight Glimmer and Princess Luna,Something is wrong!
Starlight Glimmer,A dream? This is another dream!
Princess Luna,[whispering] Starlight Glimmer...!
Starlight Glimmer,Princess Luna?
Princess Luna,Starlight Glimmer!
Starlight Glimmer,"Princess Luna, where are you?"
Princess Luna,"Starlight Glimmer, there is no time! You must get help!"
Starlight Glimmer,What? What are you talking about? This is just a dream!
Princess Luna,"Not here! In the waking world! They've taken my sister and I! It's worse than the last time! Your dream called to me, and I was able to break through! You must find help!"
Starlight Glimmer,What are you saying?! Who's taken you?!
Starlight Glimmer,Princess Luna!
Starlight Glimmer,[panting] They're back!
Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie? Trixie, it's Starlight! Are you awake?"
Trixie,"[muffled, bleary] Of course, Princess Celestia... I'd love to perform for peanut butter crackers..."
Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, wake up!"
Trixie,[coughing] [tired] Starlight? What time is it?
Starlight Glimmer,It's late. I think I figured out what's wrong with my friends!
Trixie,[yawning] I have a whole list of things that are wrong with your friends. We can go over it in the morning.
Starlight Glimmer,"No, Trixie, we're in danger!"
Trixie,"[sighs] Okay, fine! Aside from lack of sleep, how are we in danger?"
Starlight Glimmer,I think the<U+0097>! [beat] What did you tell me never to tell another pony?
Trixie,"Starlight, if you woke me up to play guessing games<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,"After we left my village, what did you tell me to never tell another pony you said?"
Trixie,[sighs] [through very gritted teeth] That even Trixie's made mistakes.
Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, there's no time for this! What did you say?"
Trixie,That even Trixie's made mistakes! Okay? Are you happy?!
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] Yes. Sorry. I just had to make sure you weren't... [hushed] one of them!
Trixie,[hushed] One of who?
Starlight Glimmer,A changeling! I think they've taken Princess Celestia and Princess Luna!
Trixie,"What?! Are you sure?! I mean, what do we<U+0097>? We have to tell Twilight!"
Starlight Glimmer,"If I'm right, then it's too late for that."
Twilight Sparkle,Is it ready?
Applejack,Just one more.
Starlight Glimmer,Queen Chrysalis!
Queen Chrysalis,Ugh. I can't take any of you seriously when you look like that.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, right."
Queen Chrysalis,Much better. Now report!
Changeling,"Everything here is going according to plan! We've replaced the six ponies and their dragon, and have taken control of the castle!"
Queen Chrysalis,Excellent. And I've just received word that the princesses from Canterlot have successfully been replaced as well.
Trixie,[panting] I can't deal with this! I'm just a performer! This is... This is princess-level stuff! But the changelings have all the princesses... We're doomed!
Starlight Glimmer,"Maybe not. Uh, Queen Chrysalis only said they took Luna and Celestia and obviously Twilight and the others... but maybe Cadance is still safe. Our best bet is to get to the Crystal Empire before the changelings do. That way we can<U+0097>"
Thorax,There's no help coming from the Crystal Empire.
Starlight Glimmer,Thorax?
Thorax,Yes.
Starlight Glimmer,Your wings look... different.
Thorax,I guess they do.
Starlight Glimmer,How do I know you aren't some other changeling pretending to be Thorax?
Thorax,You were there when Spike defended me to the ponies of the Crystal Empire. Princess Twilight said<U+0097>
Thorax,"As the Princess of Friendship, I should set an example for all of Equestria. But today it was Spike who taught me<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,"Okay, okay. I believe you. We don't need the whole speech."
Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, this is Thorax. He's a reformed changeling. He's on our side. Understand?"
Thorax,Hi. It's a pleasure to...
Trixie,"If Starlight says you're on our side, I believe her. But maybe just stay over there for now, okay?"
Starlight Glimmer,What did you mean there's no help? Did the changelings get Cadance too?
Thorax,"They took Cadance, Shining Armor, and Flurry Heart! Sunburst sent me here to get Princess Twilight's help, but... but it sounds like it's too late for that, too! So... what should we do?"
Trixie,"Yeah, Starlight. What are we gonna do?"
Starlight Glimmer,I... I don't know! There has to be somepony else who can handle this?
Trixie,There is nopony else! Everypony with powerful magic is already gone!
Discord,"You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, they always leave me out. If I weren't so evolved, I might decide to take it personally. Well, isn't this quite the combination of secondary characters? Where are Twilight and the girls?"
Starlight Glimmer,"First, how do we know that you're really you?"
Discord,Shall I continue?
Starlight Glimmer,"Chrysalis and the changelings are back. They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies in Equestria! Celestia, Luna, Cadance, Shining Armor, Flurry Heart, Twilight and her friends. We need to<U+0097>"
Discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
Starlight Glimmer,Yes!
Discord,[menacingly] Where?
Starlight Glimmer,"The Changeling Kingdom. With you on our side, I can<U+0097>"
Discord,"Odd. I was trying to take us right to Fluttershy, but there is no Fluttershy."
Trixie,[whimpers] I think I have a pretty good idea where she might be...
Thorax,I'd hoped never to see that place again. Now what?
Starlight Glimmer,It's... the ponies from my old village.
Starlight Glimmer,Oh. It's only a dream.
Starlight Glimmer,"With my past, I should never be in charge of anything!"
Princess Luna,They've taken my sister and I! It's worse than the last time!
Starlight Glimmer,Chrysalis and the changelings are back. They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies in Equestria!
Starlight Glimmer,...this is Thorax. He's a reformed changeling.
Discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
Trixie,[whimpers] I think I have a pretty good idea where she might be...
Discord,"Oh, this is so strange. We're here and that's there, and I clearly meant for us to be there and not here."
Thorax,"Oh, I-I can probably explain<U+0097>"
Discord,"Oh, well. If at first you don't succeed..."
Starlight Glimmer,Maybe we should come up with a plan first?
Discord,[blows] A what?
Trixie,"You know, figuring out the best way to do something before you actually do it."
Discord,"[laughs] Oh, that's adorable. But you see, unlike you, I can do anything."
Thorax,"Uh, actually<U+0097>"
Discord,"That's all very nice, but really a waste of time. We have me. And what else could we possibly need?"
Trixie,A draconequus with magic and half a brain might help.
Discord,"Why are you here again? I mean, it's not like you're going to stop the changelings by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. At least my magic can do something."
Thorax,The thing about magic here is<U+0097>
Thorax,I've been trying to tell you! Nothing other than changeling magic works here. Chrysalis' throne is carved from an ancient dark stone that soaks up outside magic the same way changelings soak up love. It's how she keeps the hive safe.
Trixie,"[to Starlight] So, uh, what kind of plan were you thinking?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Without magic, I have no idea. But nopony else is coming. So somepony better come up with something."
Starlight Glimmer,"Anypony? Anything? Hmm. This throne <U+0096> if we get into the hive and destroy it, can we get our magic back?"
Thorax,Uh-huh!
Discord,"Well, that's a terrible plan. How are we even supposed to get to the hive?"
Trixie,We walk.
Discord,I haven't walked that far in a millennia!
Discord,"Oh, I don't know how any of you manage not being able to disappear and reappear whenever you want!"
Trixie,"Well, I, for one, definitely miss you being able to disappear!"
Starlight Glimmer,Give Discord a break. None of us knew we weren't going to be able to use magic.
Thorax,I did.
Starlight Glimmer,"If we get separated, it might make sense to have a way to make sure we are who we say we are."
Trixie,"How about if we say ""klutzy"" and you say ""draconequus""?"
Starlight Glimmer,"""Klutzy draconequus"". Works for me."
Thorax,I'll definitely remember it.
Trixie,Okay. I am definitely glad you came. I don't think we'd be able to find our way without you.
Thorax,You definitely wouldn't.
Trixie,"Um, where's the way out?"
Thorax,"It's a changeling hive. It shifts and changes like we do, and we're the only ones who can navigate it. It's total chaos to non-changelings."
Discord,"Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it ""total""."
Discord,Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy?
Starlight Glimmer,"If Thorax is right, then yes."
Discord,"[sarcastic] Well, that's reassuring."
Trixie,And how are we supposed to destroy the throne when we find it?
Starlight Glimmer,I... don't know.
Trixie,[sarcastic] That's reassuring.
Discord,I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.
Trixie,Asks the Lord of Chaos who can't go for a walk without whining nonstop!
Discord,"Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while you'll still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist!"
Trixie,"Self-absorbed?! Why, you...!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Cut. It. Out! I'm just barely keeping it together, and it would be wonderful if you two could actually try to help instead of bickering like foals!"
Discord,[defeated] Okay.
Trixie,How can we help?
Starlight Glimmer,"Don't ask me! I couldn't even handle giving advice at the Sunset Festival, and I had magic then! And the three of us are as good as useless! At least Thorax knows where we're going."
Thorax,"Um, guys? I think we're lost."
Trixie,"Oh, great. We might as well just sit here and wait for the changelings to soak up all of our love or whatever gross thing it is that they do. How often do you all get hungry?"
Thorax,"Actually, I haven't been since I met Spike. And changelings are always hungry. We can never get enough love."
Trixie,"Well, that's just super<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,But you aren't hungry at all now?
Thorax,"Huh. Once I made a few friends, I guess I just sort of forgot about the whole feeding thing."
Starlight Glimmer,Is that about the same time your wings changed?
Thorax,I guess so.
Trixie,[hushed] Can you please lower your voice?! You're gonna get us all captured!
Discord,"Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive."
Trixie,W-What's that?
Thorax,A changeling patrol!
Discord,This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.
Trixie,"What kind of plan?! We have no magic, and it's not like my illusions are gonna save us!"
Starlight Glimmer,Do you have any of your smoke bombs?
Trixie,Are you kidding?
Thorax,Looking for somepony?
Discord,"Not exactly great and powerful, but effective."
Trixie,Hm. I'll take it.
Starlight Glimmer,"""Klutzy""..."
Trixie and Thorax,"...""draconequus""!"
Discord,Ugh. I really think we need a new code word!
Thorax,That was a pretty good plan.
Trixie,But we still don't know where we're going.
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, we might. Two of the changelings didn't go with the rest."
Thorax,"Oh! With an intruder in the hive, they went to protect the queen! Good thinking, Starlight!"
Trixie,Now what?
Starlight Glimmer,We... go in.
Thorax,"Even if I wanted to, there's no way past the guards. We'll be spotted for sure."
Starlight Glimmer,We need some kind of... distraction.
Trixie,I'm fresh out of smoke bombs.
Discord,"Normally, I'm the most distracting thing I can think of, but without magic..."
Starlight Glimmer,You shouldn't underestimate yourself.
Discord,"[taps microphone] Hello, changelings and changelettes! Believe me, I was just as surprised as you are that I'm here! When I heard that I'd be playing for a bunch of changelings, I was beside myself! Then I realized, it was just one of you."
Discord,"[nervous laugh] But, seriously, this isn't the toughest crowd I've ever been in front of. But it's definitely the easiest to bug!"
Discord,"Well, if you think that you can do any better, be my guest!"
Trixie,It is absolutely ridiculous that that worked.
Discord,It is certainly a pleasure to have such dedicated fans. I'll have to come back with some new material after I rescue Fluttershy.
Discord,Fluttershy!
Fluttershy,Discord! I'm stuck!
Discord,You certainly are. And I should probably help you get free. But... oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...
Fluttershy,But what?
Discord,But you are obviously not Fluttershy!
Fluttershy,Oh.
Discord,"I mean, I'm separated from the group and just happen to come across the one pony I care most about? I can smell this setup a mile away."
Fluttershy,"[sniffs, crying] No. You're right. There's no way you should trust me. Just go find the others. [wailing] I understand!"
Discord,"Oh, come on!"
Others,"Fluttershy # We're probably all changelings. You shouldn't rescue any of us. Unless, you think, maybe one of us might be the real Fluttershy. Oh, that certainly would be a nasty changeling trick, wouldn't it?"
Others,Fluttershy # I'm the real one.
Others,Fluttershy # I'm the real one.
Others,Fluttershy # I'm the real Fluttershy.
Thorax,"We can't wait for Discord. Between seeing him and Trixie, the castle will be crawling with guards soon."
Starlight Glimmer,"But if we do manage to destroy Chrysalis' throne, we'll need him. He could take on the entire changeling army by sneezing if he wanted to."
Trixie,He's probably already been captured!
Changeling,Hello? Fellow rescuers?
Thorax,We can't stay here. We gotta find the throne.
Changeling,Ooh! I heard some of the changelings who were chasing me say that they know where it is!
Trixie,"""Klutzy""...?"
Changeling,"Hmm? Oh. Yeah. [chuckling] I-I can be klutzy. Now, follow me."
Starlight Glimmer,"[whispering] You know that's not Discord, right?"
Trixie,Obviously.
Changeling,This way! We're almost there!
Thorax,"I know this trick. If he says to go left, we should definitely go right. He's leading us to a swarm waiting to attack!"
Trixie,"[sighs] Okay, I'll handle it. You two just get ready to run into the other tunnel."
Starlight Glimmer,"Wait, what?! Trixie, you can't! I won't know what to do! We've already lost Discord; I can't lose you too! Without magic, I<U+0097>"
Trixie,"Starlight. You got us this far with just my illusions and Discord's annoying personality. You don't need magic to figure out what to do next. I know you're afraid to be in charge, but you are really good at it! Listen to your best friend. Hey, Discord! Want to see the new trick I've been working on? I call it the ""Changeling Catcher""! Run!"
Trixie,[nervously] Ta-da...
Queen Chrysalis,"[laughing evilly] One little pony all by herself. [joints cracking] Oh, how will I ever prevent this daring rescue?"
Queen Chrysalis,"Well, well, well. The Princess of Friendship's sole pupil. Honestly, I didn't think you were worth replacing with one of my drones."
Thorax,[strains] You won't get away with this!
Queen Chrysalis,"I already have. Nopony is coming to save you. Your little squad was it. And now, there's just you."
Thorax,Thorax is still out there.
Queen Chrysalis,"Don't mention that traitor's name in my kingdom! He was a fool to leave and even more a fool to return! When I find him, he'll learn just what happens to those who betray the hive!"
Queen Chrysalis,"And it seems I don't have far to look, do I..."
Queen Chrysalis,Thorax?
Queen Chrysalis,"Very clever. And clearly Thorax revealed to you the secret of my throne. I can't have powerful ponies using their abilities against me. Even with your rather embarrassing little rescue attempt, everything has gone according to my plan."
Starlight Glimmer,What plan? Why did you do all this?!
Starlight Glimmer,What if you didn't have to?
Queen Chrysalis,Ridiculous! The hunger of changelings can never be satisfied!
Starlight Glimmer,"Exactly! Thorax left the hive and made a friend. He shared love, and now he doesn't need to feed. You don't have to live your lives starving all the time!"
Queen Chrysalis,"You know nothing of the changelings or what it takes to be their queen! I decide what is best for my subjects, not some mewling grub!"
Starlight Glimmer,I know what it's like to lead by fear and intimidation! And I know what it's like to want everypony to do what you say! But I was wrong. A real leader doesn't force her subjects to deny who they are! She celebrates what makes them unique and listens when one of them finds a better way!
Queen Chrysalis,The only thing Thorax has found is what happens to those who turn their back on the hive!
Starlight Glimmer,No! Stop!
Queen Chrysalis,Just as soon as I drain every last ounce of love from him and show my subjects what a real leader is!
Thorax,[straining] I can feel the love inside me slipping away...! I can't hold onto it much longer...!
Starlight Glimmer,Then don't! Sharing love is what made you different to begin with! You should share yours with Chrysalis! Give her all of it!
Starlight Glimmer,This is what happens when you give love freely instead of taking it!
Discord,Fluttershy?
Fluttershy,"It's, um, good to see you, too."
Twilight Sparkle,Starlight? What happened?
Starlight Glimmer,"We defeated the changelings with no magic at all, they found a new leader, and... they're all kinda... good now."
Princess Luna,"Well done, Starlight Glimmer. It seems as though you've learned a great deal since we last spoke."
Starlight Glimmer,"When Twilight and her friends defeated me, I chose to run away and seek revenge! You don't have to! You can be the leader your subjects deserve."
Queen Chrysalis,"There is no revenge you could ever conceive of that will come close to what I will exact upon you one day, Starlight Glimmer!"
Princess Celestia,"Thorax, as the new leader of the changelings, I look forward to discussing how we can improve our relationship in the future. However, for the moment, perhaps it is best that we leave the Changeling Kingdom to the changelings."
Discord,Splendid idea! Now who's ready for some celebratory tea at Fluttershy's?!
Fluttershy,"Oh! Uh, everypony?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, now that you can snap your claws and send us absolutely anywhere again, I think I have a better option."
Party Favor,"Uh, hey, Starlight. What are you doing here?"
Double Diamond,"You left in such a hurry before, we kinda thought you didn't wanna come."
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah... I guess after the way I used my magic on all of you, I wasn't sure I was somepony who should even be in charge of a baking contest. I was afraid I might go back to being the pony I used to be. But I realize that sometimes you don't have a choice. You have to step up. And I have changed! I can handle it. Whether that means saving Equestria or helping friends out with the Sunset Festival. Speaking of which, I know the Festival's almost over, but I kinda invited a few of my friends to join. Hope that's okay."
Double Diamond,[laughing] Are you kidding? Of course!
Starlight Glimmer,Great! Now where's that baking contest? This pony needs a cupcake!
Discord,So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.
Trixie,"Yeah, yeah. And I'm still a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist, right?"
Discord,"Actually, I was going to say a couple of those illusions were slightly above average. If you ever need a little chaos in your act, let me know."
Trixie,Ha! When pigs fly!
Trixie,Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
Rainbow Dash,Somepony is really gonna have to catch us up on what we missed.
Starlight Glimmer,"Hey, Spike. What's up?"
Spike,"Just, uh, wanted to make sure you're ready for your big ceremony today."
Starlight Glimmer,Yep!
Starlight Glimmer,"Wow, I still can't believe my friends and I are getting medals..."
Twilight Sparkle,Shhh!
Starlight Glimmer,...of honor.
Spike,"Are you kidding? You totally deserve it! After all, you... saved Equestria from... Queen Chrysalis! With the help of Trixie and Thorax and Discord and..."
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, yeah. I know what happened. I was kinda there."
Spike,"Uh, right. Uh, so... what are you wearin'?"
Starlight Glimmer,Not sure. Why? Am I supposed to dress up?
Starlight Glimmer,What are you looking at?
Spike,"No, don't look!"
Spike,"'Cause there was a spider there, but it's, uh, gone now, so, uh... thanks, Starlight! Byeeee!"
Starlight Glimmer,Huh?
Spike,"Ha-ha! She had no idea. We're a good team, Sparkle!"
Twilight Sparkle,"""Sparkle""? [laughs] Yeah, we are. So do you think she'll like it? I want this present to say, ""I'm so proud of you both as a mentor and a friend. Equestria is safer thanks to you."""
Spike,Oh. I thought you were getting her a mirror like yours.
Twilight Sparkle,I am.
Spike,"Uh, maybe you should get her a card 'cause I don't think the mirror will say all that. But I think she'll like it."
Twilight Sparkle,It's just what her room needs. The first thing she'll see when she wakes up is herself surrounded by all her friends. I plan on giving it to her after the ceremony.
Spike,"Yeah, about that. Don't you need to get the castle ready for the celebration?"
Twilight Sparkle,Nah. Pinkie Pie's got that covered.
Pinkie Pie,Hmmm.
Pinkie Pie,Phew!
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, Trixie, Thorax, and Discord were brave in the face of danger, resourceful when things got challenging, and proved that the bonds of friendship, no matter how unlikely, are stronger than any adversity. By stopping Queen Chrysalis, not only did they save Equestria; they set the changelings free from her reign."
Princess Celestia,And that's why we're proud and honored to give them the Equestrian Pink Hearts of Courage!
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! Oh. Uh, no. Not quite. Uh... all right. There it is!"
Pinkie Pie,Yay!
Twilight Sparkle,We are so proud of you all!
Trixie,It was the Great and Powerful Trrrrixie's pleasure to save you from your imminent doom.
Discord,"Yes, because you did it all by yourself."
Sunburst,I can't believe you managed to do it without magic.
Changeling,It was amazing!
Changeling,No one's ever stood up to Chrysalis like that!
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, I just did what anypony would have done."
Princess Celestia,"It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Watching your student shine the way you always knew they could."
Twilight Sparkle,[laughs] My cheeks are sore! I don't think I've ever smiled this much in my life!
Princess Celestia,I can only imagine what that feels like.
Discord,"Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by ""we"", I definitely mean ""you"". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, don't you worry. I've planned enough friendship lessons to cover the next three years."
Twilight Sparkle,What's so funny?
Discord,"No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,[nervous laugh] Of course I was.
Discord,"Obviously, you should have a grand master plan for her, the same way Celestia set you on the path that eventually made you a princess."
Twilight Sparkle,Yep.
Discord,"Oh, good. I'm sure she can't wait to hear all about it."
Starlight Glimmer,So how's the whole ruling-a-kingdom thing going?
Thorax,It's a bit overwhelming. But we're adjusting.
Changeling Girl,"So, uh, you can't have friendship without makeovers?"
Applejack,"Eh, not-not exactly."
Discord,"Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear."
Starlight Glimmer,Okay. Would you excuse m<U+0097>?
Starlight Glimmer,Never mind. What's going on?
Discord,"Well, Twilight was just about to reveal her grand master plan for you."
Starlight Glimmer,Really? I was kind of wondering what we were gonna do next.
Discord,Yes. I'd say we were both fairly interested.
Trixie,"Starlight, come on! The Ponyville Chronicle wants to take our picture! Ugh. You, too, Discord."
Discord,Psst! I see what you're doing.
Twilight Sparkle,You do?
Discord,"You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Discord, no!"
Spike,"Twilight, are you reading during a party... again?"
Twilight Sparkle,"No, no, no! She's already good at that! She mastered this! She taught me about this one!"
Spike,Wild guess <U+0096> something's wrong.
Spike,Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,"I had years worth of friendship lessons ready to go, but when we were captured by Chrysalis, Starlight took charge and really stepped up. I don't think friendship lessons are enough for her anymore."
Princess Celestia,So you have an overachieving student. Sounds familiar.
Twilight Sparkle,"That's why I had to talk to you. You, of all ponies, would know what to do. I mean, you were me and I was Starlight. But, for now, I need you to pretend you're you and I'm me."
Spike,Huh?
Princess Celestia,Heh. Go on.
Twilight Sparkle,"When I was your student, and you were in this place, you<U+0097> Oh, no! You sent me to Ponyville! Which means it's time for me to send Starlight Glimmer away!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I can't believe it! It's really time for Starlight to go, isn't it?"
Princess Celestia,"Only you can make that decision. It's a difficult one, but your heart knows what's right, even as it hurts."
Spike,"Where're you gonna send her? Uh, too soon?"
Twilight Sparkle,"No. This is something I have to do. Oh, boy."
Fluttershy,"Oh, boy!"
Discord,Whatever Twilight's planning for Starlight is going to be so exciting!
Applejack,Hmm. Wonder why she didn't tell any of us about it.
Discord,"Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!"
Pinkie Pie,"[squeals] That's so exciting! And surprising. Usually, you tell your party planner about all your plans for your party."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, she definitely has one. I mean when has Twilight not had a plan?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[low muttering] Gosh, I don't know... I just don't want to send her to the wrong place... [sighs] I just, I just don't know... [gasps] I got it! Since defeating Chrysalis, Starlight's given the changelings an opportunity to revolutionize their society. Maybe I can send her there."
Spike,Cool spell.
Twilight Sparkle,"If Starlight goes to the changeling hive, she can help them adjust to their new way of life."
Starlight Glimmer,"Okay, Friendship 101. Thorax and I are going to show you how to compromise."
Thorax,[stiltedly] I want to have honeysuckle nectar for lunch.
Starlight Glimmer,"[stiltedly] I would like a sandwich. Oh, no. What should we do?"
Changeling 1,Attack! The winner gets to choose!
Starlight Glimmer,Or... Thorax and I can talk about it and come up with a solution that works for everypony.
Thorax,"[stiltedly] Starlight, how do you feel about honeysuckle and peanut butter sandwiches?"
Starlight Glimmer,"[stiltedly] Why, that sounds dee-licious!"
Starlight Glimmer and Thorax,Compromise.
Spike,"Uh, this doesn't seem like something Starlight and Thorax would do."
Princess Celestia,"Uh, this is Twilight's fantasy, Spike. There is no wrong way to fantasize."
Twilight Sparkle,Thank you.
Changeling 1,Starlight Glimmer is a most apt and perspicacious pony!
Spike,Yep. Definitely a Twilight fantasy.
Princess Celestia,"This seems like a lovely path for Starlight. The changelings have so much to learn about how to enjoy love through friendships. Starlight would be busy for a very long time, but her work there would be very rewarding."
Twilight Sparkle,Or dangerous. It would only take one changeling to deviate from the pack.
Goofy Changeling,"[evil laugh] Hi, I'm Starlight Glimmer! What's your name?"
Cornicle,"Uh, Cornicle?"
Goofy Changeling,"[laughs] What kind of name is that? Ah, your wings are so, um... see-through. I'm so glad I'm a pony. Are you, like, bugs, or what?"
Cornicle,[gasps] There she is! Get her!
Spike,"Uh, that probably won't happen."
Twilight Sparkle,But it could! I can't just send her off to Celestia-knows-where without thinking it through!
Princess Celestia,"Hmm. I was not aware that I was an expression. An appropriate one, of course, for even I don't know the answer. This is a momentous decision. You must consider all the possibilities."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rethink, rethink, rethink! What about the dragons? I can send Starlight to the Dragon Lands! She and Ember would totally hit it off!"
Starlight Glimmer,Ember!
Princess Ember,Starlight!
Princess Ember,You ready to do some death-defying dragon stuff?
Starlight Glimmer,"Ah, totally!"
Spike,"Okay, that doesn't sound anything like Ember or Starlight."
Twilight Sparkle,"Who knows what their dynamic would be, Spike?"
Spike,Freaky.
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight will love it in the Dragon Lands. In her letters, Ember said dragons do a lot of fun things. The Feast of Fire, the Dragon Bowl, Claw-chella."
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight could be there for a really long time. But then again, not all dragons like ponies as much as Ember does."
Garble,"Hey, Twinkle Star!"
Starlight Glimmer,"It's, uh, Starlight Glimmer."
Garble,Star-kle Light-star?
Starlight Glimmer,Starlight. Glimmer.
Garble,"Yeah, whatever. You wanna hang with us?"
Starlight Glimmer,What are we diving into?
Garble,Lava!
Starlight Glimmer,What?!
Spike,"Twilight, this is crazy!"
Spike,Starlight's really good with magic. She could just stop herself from falling into a pit of lava.
Twilight Sparkle,"What if she didn't realize it was happening?! You just never know, Spike! I just need to think of someplace safe to send her! Someplace safe, someplace safe, someplace safe... I could send her to the Crystal Empire to continue her magical studies with Sunburst!"
Twilight Sparkle,It'll be perfect! Sunburst's knowledge of magic is only matched by Starlight's abilities.
Sunburst,I've got it! Try placing your horn directly on the potion and picture the clock you wish to make.
Twilight Sparkle,They could challenge each other into becoming the most talented unicorns Equestria's ever seen!
Starlight Glimmer,"We did it! Quick, what's next?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Of course, the study of magic is a lifelong pursuit, and Starlight could be there for a while, especially once they start attempting the really complicated stuff!"
Spike,"Three, two, one..."
Twilight Sparkle,What if they become too ambitious?!
Starlight Glimmer,I never would've thought to combine Star Swirl's apparition spell with Spacium Flexibus! But what would happen if we added Somnambula's Tempus Objectus?
Sunburst,"If we do it just right, it should allow us to materialize an object that was lost in the past."
Twilight Sparkle,No! Don't do it!
Sunburst and Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, noooooo!"
Spike,"Twilight, snap out of it!"
Spike,"Easy, Twilight. It didn't happen."
Twilight Sparkle,But it could! I just don't think I can send her anywhere. What am I gonna do?
Twilight Sparkle,Are you laughing at me?
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe you're laughing at me.
Princess Celestia,"Oh, Twilight, I'm not. I'm laughing because I had the exact same fears you're having."
Twilight Sparkle,What?!
Princess Celestia,"Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a very bright young filly."
Princess Celestia,[voiceover] She was truly one of my best students.
Spike,[voiceover] Are you talking about Twilight? I can't see what you're thinking about.
Princess Celestia,"[voiceover] Yes, Spike. I was constantly surprised and impressed with her discoveries. But I noticed that her pursuit of academia was preventing her from reaching her full potential."
Spike,[voiceover] You mean it was keeping her isolated and alone?
Princess Celestia,"[voiceover] Uh, yes, Spike. I had a decision to make. Oh, but it wasn't easy."
Princess Celestia,"Maybe I could close the library or throw a party in the castle. Oh, she'd have to talk to the other fillies then! Oh. I must send her away."
Princess Celestia,"[voiceover] I knew there was a special group of fillies in Ponyville, but I kept inventing all kinds of reasons why I shouldn't send you."
Princess Celestia,"What if she runs into a manticore? Or what if she gets pulled into Tartarus? Or, worst of all, what if she doesn't get along with anypony?!"
Guard 1,Are we supposed to say something?
Guard 2,I don't think so.
Princess Celestia,[voiceover] I kept you in Canterlot longer than I should have.
Princess Celestia,"Eventually, I realized all the anxiety I felt was because I didn't want you to go."
Twilight Sparkle,Really?
Princess Celestia,"I loved having you as a student. You challenged me and taught me just as much as I taught you. I am embarrassed to admit it, but I was afraid if you made friends, you wouldn't need me anymore."
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia, that is so not true. I will always need you."
Princess Celestia,I think Starlight Glimmer might feel the same way about you. If that is what you're afraid of.
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe it is. Just a little.
Spike,"[chuckles] Oh, it definitely is. Like, a lot."
Princess Celestia,"Here we are after all these years, Twilight. We are living proof that letting someone spread their wings doesn't mean you no longer have a place in their lives."
Twilight Sparkle,Thank you.
Princess Celestia,"And if you're still worried, you can always make her write you letters."
Discord,I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for Starlight tonight. Silly me. But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.
Discord,"You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you."
Twilight Sparkle,"[sarcastically] Gee, thanks, Discord."
Discord,Anytime. I really do love being helpful.
Twilight Sparkle,"If I could have everypony's attention! As you all know, Starlight Glimmer's been my pupil for a while now, and I'd hoped she'd be my pupil for a long time yet to come. But it turns out that's just not meant to be."
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, you have proved yourself to be a kind, loyal, strong, honest, and truly magical friend. Just looking around this room at all the new friendships you've made, I know there's nothing more I need to teach you. So we have a second reason to celebrate today. Three cheers for Starlight Glimmer on her graduation day!"
Pinkie Pie,"[squeals, giggles] What a great surprise!"
Twilight Sparkle,[to Starlight] The future's in your own hooves now.
Starlight Glimmer,Wow. I was not expecting this!
Discord,Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.
Trixie,How do you want to celebrate? Girls' trip to Las Pegasus?
Thorax,"We could throw you a changeling Gorbfest! Uh, it's more fun than it sounds."
Discord,"Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a ""gouda"" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path."
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, that all sounds wonderful. But, um, give me a minute, would ya?"
Twilight Sparkle,Congratulations.
Starlight Glimmer,Thanks.
Twilight Sparkle,So how do you feel?
Starlight Glimmer,"Happy, surprised, overwhelmed. I mean, not that I'm not grateful, but are you sure?"
Twilight Sparkle,Believe me. I've thought long and hard about this.
Starlight Glimmer,Of course you did.
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, trust me. You're ready."
Starlight Glimmer,Yeah!
Starlight Glimmer,"No, I'm not."
Twilight Sparkle,What are you talking about?
Starlight Glimmer,I'm not ready to leave!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, good! 'Cause I'm not ready for that either! Here! I got you this present. It was going to be a ""congrats on getting a medal of honor"" present, but then I was afraid it would have to be a going-away present, but now it's an ""I couldn't be happier you're staying"" present! It fits perfectly over your dresser! I know. I measured."
Starlight Glimmer,Thank you.
Twilight Sparkle,"I may not know what comes next for you, but whatever it is, I promise I'll always be there for you."
Starlight Glimmer,Oh.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh.
Pinkie Pie,Phee-yew!
Trixie,"Come on, come on! Turn into a teacup!"
Trixie,No! Teacup!
Trixie,No! Teacup!
Trixie,"[screeching] No! [normally] Oh, Starlight! I can't put a trick that's not working into my act! How come it's not working?"
Starlight Glimmer,"It could be because you're just yelling ""teacup!"" and not picturing it in your mind."
Trixie,"Oh. Yeah, that could be it."
Starlight Glimmer,What does your teacup look like? What shape is it? What color?
Trixie,"Whoo! Starlight, I did it!"
Trixie,"Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I did it, I did it, I did it! Woo-hoo-hoo!"
Starlight Glimmer,Hey!
Trixie,"Teacup! [giggles] Teacup! Teacup, teacup, teacup! Tea-cup! Teacup, teacup, tea-cup! You know what you need? A teacup!"
Trixie,Whoops! I guess I pictured a teacup poodle? Heh.
Starlight Glimmer,Trixie! You ruined my teacakes!
Trixie,"I just got excited! This is the first time I did a transfiguration spell! Real magic! Come on! Be impressed by me! [as Starlight Glimmer] ""Yay, Trixie! You're so great at magic and having good hair!"""
Starlight Glimmer,"[chuckles] Good job, Trix. But I was baking these to give to Twilight and the girls for their friendship retreat. Pinkie Pie gave me a recipe and everything."
Trixie,Problem solved.
Starlight Glimmer,[exhales] Not exactly.
Twilight Sparkle,I am so excited for this friendship retreat! I can't remember the last time we all got to hang out without having to save Equestria.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, we are awesome. But technically, we weren't the last ponies to save Equestria."
Twilight Sparkle,I was speaking in a broader sense. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?
Spike,"Yeah, I have three new comics to get through."
Starlight Glimmer,"And I promised Trixie we'd practice more magic. It might be better if the castle was empty, if you know what I mean."
Trixie,"[groans] Relax. If anything breaks, Starlight will just go back in time and fix it!"
Trixie,Kidding.
Starlight Glimmer,We'll take good care of the castle while you're gone.
Trixie,"Have fun on your friendship retreat! [hushed, to Starlight] What in Equestria is a friendship retreat, anyway?"
Starlight Glimmer,"[hushed] They're gonna bond, share laughs, and if I know them, they're gonna sing a song."
Trixie,[giggles] We are gonna have so much more fun than them!
Starlight Glimmer,[giggles] Shhh!
Trixie,"Twilight, wait! Starlight has something for you!"
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Starlight Glimmer,"[nervously] Here, I, um, brought you snacks..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, how... thoughtful, thanks. We will... not get hungry on the train."
Starlight Glimmer,"It was supposed to be teacakes, but... [sighs] it's a long story. Have a great time!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You, too!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Okay, Trixie, what kinds of spells did you want to work on next?"
Trixie,"Well, every self-respecting magician has a disappearing act, so maybe we could start with that?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Hmmm. Nothing just disappears, so that's technically a teleportation spell, and those are pretty hard. Maybe we should start with something smaller."
Trixie,No-no-no-no. The Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie goes big or not at all! Just tell me how you do it.
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I've always found magic is tied to my emotions. Whatever I'm feeling fuels whatever I'm doing, and the stronger I'm feeling, the stronger the magic."
Trixie,"Right. Like when you were so upset that cutie marks took away your friend, your magic was strong enough to enslave an entire village."
Starlight Glimmer,Yep. Thanks for bringing that up.
Trixie,See? I'm already learning. If anypony is gonna teach me how to do a disappearing spell<U+0097>
Starlight Glimmer,Teleportation spell.
Trixie,"Whatever. I'm complimenting you. And me. We can do this, 'cause we're amazing, and magic is friendship and stuff."
Starlight Glimmer,"[laughs] I guess we can give it a whirl. Now, we just need to find you something to teleport."
Trixie,Spike! How about it?
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, let's pick something, I don't know, not living?"
Trixie,"I mean it won't be as impressive, but okay. Teach away, mini-Twilight."
Others,"""Ginger Locks"": [bored] Welcome to Manehattan Escapes."
Rarity,"Ooh, I'm going to start with a facial, and then get my hooves done, and<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, it's not that kind of retreat."
Rarity,"Isn't it called ""Manehattan Escapes"" because it's a deluxe spa where you can escape all of your troubles?"
Twilight Sparkle,Nope! It's because we get locked in a room and we have to solve puzzles and riddles in order to escape!
Others,"""Ginger Locks"": [bored] The clues will lead you to a key to get out."
Twilight Sparkle,Team-building!
Applejack,"Come on, girls. This could be fun."
Twilight Sparkle,Could be? Some of the brightest minds in Equestria put together these puzzles!
Fluttershy,I'm just happy to be with all of you.
Pinkie Pie,"Me, too! I'm not great at solving riddles, but I'm super great at cheering other ponies on while they do it! Go, us! Ooo, ooo! Woo-hoo!"
Rarity,"Yes, yes, woo-hoo. [clears throat] But just so we know, exactly how long will we be locked in here?"
Others,"""Ginger Locks"": [bored] A group of griffons set the record for the fastest escape. It only took them an hour."
Rainbow Dash,"Hah! Griffons barely like each other! We're basically the poster ponies for amazing friendships! So get your quill ready, bub! You're gonna have to write down a new record!"
Starlight Glimmer,"If you master this spell before the girls get back, you'd be setting some kind of record!"
Trixie,Challenge accepted!
Starlight Glimmer,Okay. What you want to do is concentrate on the object that you want to teleport...
Spike,"Yeah, I'm gonna go... all the way over here."
Trixie,Concentrate on teleporting. Got it. Doin' the spell!
Starlight Glimmer,"No, Trix, wait, not just<U+0097>"
Trixie,[weakly] Ta-da.
Starlight Glimmer,[hyperventilating] No-no-no-no-no-no-no! You made Twilight's friendship map disappear!
Trixie,[clears throat] Teleport.
Starlight Glimmer,Really?!
Trixie,"Well, it was behind the apple. It was bound to happen. On the plus side, my magic is getting better! I made a whole table go poof! That was pretty impressive!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, we have to get that map back."
Trixie,We'll find it. No big deal.
Starlight Glimmer,Twilight's never gonna trust me to be alone in this castle again! What were you thinking?!
Trixie,"Teleport, like you told me to."
Starlight Glimmer,"No! You're supposed to concentrate on the object, not just teleporting!"
Trixie,"[scoffs] Well, gee, you probably should have told me all the steps before you let me do the spell."
Starlight Glimmer,I tried. [gasps] I... need a minute.
Spike,"Hey, are you okay?"
Starlight Glimmer,I will be once I cast a spell to contain my anger in this bottle.
Spike,"Wait, what?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Do you see this storm cloud? This has never happened before! All this magical energy has to go somewhere, and if I'm not using it to fight a magical duel or bend my friends' wills to obey my every command..."
Spike,Hah. I remember that.
Starlight Glimmer,"The point is, I don't know what my magic's going to do. So I'm hoping if I bottle up my anger, I won't do who-knows-what to Trixie."
Spike,Are you sure that's a good idea?
Starlight Glimmer,"What choice do I have? I've got to get that map back, and I don't wanna lose Trixie. If she knew what I was thinking right now, she'd probably never talk to me again."
Spike,Okay... You do what you need to do. I'll see if I can find the map somewhere in the castle.
Starlight Glimmer,Trixie!
Trixie,"Oh, there you are! For a minute, I didn't think you were coming back, and that you might be upset with me for some weird reason. But then I remembered <U+0096> you never get mad at me."
Starlight Glimmer,"[exhales] Nope! [laughs nervously] Not mad at all! So, the map is probably in the last place you were thinking of. Where was that?"
Trixie,"Ooh, great question. I wish you'd asked it, like, right after I did the spell. I don't remember anymore."
Starlight Glimmer,[groans] No worries. We'll just take a walk around town. Maybe that'll jog your memory.
Trixie,"Okay, that sounds fun. Ooh!"
Starlight Glimmer,Did you remember?
Trixie,Nope! But I did think we could stop for cinnamon nuts while we're out!
Starlight Glimmer,Cinnamon... nuts?
Starlight Glimmer,That's a good idea!
Trixie,Yes! I've been craving something sweet since I couldn't have any teacakes this morning.
Starlight Glimmer,"[exhales] You got this, Starlight..."
Pinkie Pie,"Woo-hoo! Go, Twilight! you can do it!"
Pinkie Pie,Woo-hoo!
Applejack,"Hoo-wee! You solved that triangley thing mighty fast! Uh, does anypony need a purple jewel?"
Rarity,Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?
Applejack,Don't both those fruits mean purple?
Rarity,"Yes, but one's a lovely purple and one's... well, icky."
Rainbow Dash,[groans] Just put the gem in! We're trying to set a record here!
Pinkie Pie,"[cheer-singing] Yay! We solved another clue, 'cause our friendship is so true! Yaaaay, us! Woo-hoo!"
Others,"""Clarity Cut"": Ah, hello, fillies. Uh, how can I help you? Oh, are those cinnamon nuts?"
Trixie,"Mmm, yes. I got them from the cart outside. They're delicious. Do you want some?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Have you seen a big table? Magical map on it, sometimes glowing cutie marks shoot out?"
Others,"""Clarity Cut"": [stuttering] A big ta<U+0097> Uh, no! Uh, why in Equestria would something like that be in here? Ha."
Trixie,"Well, I cast a pretty amazing spell that transported it to the last place I was thinking of, but I might have been thinking about how I'd treat myself to a nice brooch instead."
Others,"""Clarity Cut"": Ah, well, no huge table here. Uh, are you still interested in that brooch?"
Trixie,Sure!
Starlight Glimmer,No! We don't have time for this! Twilight and the girls are gonna be back soon!
Starlight Glimmer,But I'm not upset. What's our next stop?
Granny Smith,"Nope, I ain't seen it."
Starlight Glimmer,"Are you sure? It's really, really important that we find it. And it might be here because somepony..."
Starlight Glimmer,...was craving apples.
Trixie,I'm still craving them. They'd go so well with cinnamon nuts!
Granny Smith,"[sniffs] Oh, them nuts sure do smell good! Heh-heh."
Starlight Glimmer,"Granny Smith, please. The table?"
Granny Smith,"[confused muttering] Well, my eyes ain't what they used to be, but I'd know for sure if a big ol' table done appeared out of thin air."
Trixie,"Darn. I could've sworn it'd be at the ice cream parlor, because it was warm in the castle and I thought I wanted ice cream, and<U+0097> Ooh! Maybe we should check out the Crystal Empire, 'cause Twilight's castle is made out of crystals, so I totally had crystals on my mind."
Starlight Glimmer,"[tired] Okay, we better start moving if we want to make it to the Crystal Empire."
Trixie,"Are you okay, Starlight? Because you seem a little, uh, what's the word... ""lch-bh-ba""."
Starlight Glimmer,[tired] Nope. I am great.
Trixie,Did your saddlebag just glow?
Starlight Glimmer,[weakly] No.
Trixie,Gimme!
Starlight Glimmer,[weakly] No!
Trixie,Give it here!
Starlight Glimmer,[weakly] Don't!
Trixie,What's in this?
Bulk Biceps,Cinnamon nuts!
Granny Smith,"Ooh, I have had a hankerin' for these all day!"
Others,"""Clarity Cut"": Uh, me, too! Ever since that Trixie came by with 'em."
Trixie,"Um, why are they looking at me like that...?"
Trixie,Whoa!
Granny Smith,You ruined my teacakes!
Others,"""Clarity Cut"": You just had to give Twilight those smelly pretzels!"
Trixie,Were they your pretzels? I don't understand.
Bulk Biceps,You don't pay attention when I'm trying to teach you!
Trixie,"Starlight, can you help me, please?!"
Applejack,"Uh, Twilight, can you help me, please?"
Rainbow Dash,I've seen those symbols! Over here!
Pinkie Pie,You can do it!
Rarity,Almost there.
Fluttershy,I've got the key!
Twilight Sparkle,This is it! I'm so impressed.
Rainbow Dash,I'm not. I knew we were the best!
Granny Smith,You're the worst!
Trixie,That seems harsh.
Granny Smith,Hiyaaa!
Trixie,"Whoa! Starlight! [panting] I don't know what's happening! Starlight, help!"
Starlight Glimmer,I'm glad Twilight isn't here to see this.
Twilight Sparkle,I wish that Starlight was here to see how strong friendships can be when we trust each other and work together! You've all taught me so much.
Twilight Sparkle,"Friendship used to make me so queasy, queasy But you made it all so easy, easy Now I don't have to say what I'm thinking You already know without even blinking"
Applejack,You girls are the apple of my eye
Rainbow Dash,The race that doesn't end in a tie
Pinkie Pie,You are the funnel cake at my fair
Fluttershy,The warm hug of a fuzzy bear
Mane Six,Best friends until the end of time We'll have each other's backs And let our true selves shine And that's because everything we need is all right here When we're with our team
Trixie,Starlight! A spark of magic could be very helpful right about now!
Starlight Glimmer,[grunting] I can't...!
Twilight Sparkle,"I simply can't imagine there'd be a day Where I wouldn't want to be walking your way Whatever new problems there may be, may be Our friendship is always the door with the key"
Rarity,You are the jewels in my friendship crown
Twilight Sparkle,The sparks that make my world go 'round
Mane Six,"We bring the best out, that's our goal There's no telling how far we'll go"
Others,Best friends until the end of time We'll have each other's backs And let our true selves shine And that's because everything we need is all right here When we're with our team!
Others,"""Ginger Locks"": That was lovely. But, um, you know the game isn't over until you turn that key?"
Rainbow Dash,Gah!
Rainbow Dash,[panting] Did we do it?
Others,"""Ginger Locks"": So close. You missed the griffon record by two seconds. Probably shouldn't have sung that song."
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, nuts!"
Trixie,Nuts!
Bulk Biceps,You just do whatever you want to do!
Trixie,Starlight!
Granny Smith,And you don't always... [pants] ...have to bring up my dark past!
Trixie,"I didn't know you had one, Granny Smith!"
Others,"""Clarity Cut"": Oh! I just can't believe you sometimes! You make me so mad!"
Trixie,I barely even know you! I don't understand why you're all so mad at me!
Starlight Glimmer,[weakly] They're not. I am.
Trixie,You are?
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] I'm really... mad at you. You lost Twilight's map table. You make jokes like it's no big deal. It's like you don't even care you could get me in a lot of trouble. If we can't find that table, Twilight's never going to trust me again, and the worst part is you didn't even say you were sorry!"
Trixie,I... I-I'm sorry. I had no idea you felt that way.
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah! I do! [sighs] But to be fair, I don't know how you could have known. I did a spell and bottled up my anger, but when the bottle broke, it infected these three. I'm really sorry. I used magic so I wouldn't use magic. I should have guessed that would backfire."
Others,"""Clarity Cut"": Aw, that's all right. It was a slow day."
Granny Smith,"Yeah, I was gonna get my dentures cleaned before y'all showed up."
Bulk Biceps,"Ah! Oh, no! My nut cart!"
Bulk Biceps,Yay! My nut cart!
Others,"""Clarity Cut"": Uh, hang on. Don't you work at the spa?"
Bulk Biceps,[gasps] I'm late for my other job! What? I wear many hats.
Trixie,Not gonna lie. Hearing you and those random ponies say all those terrible things about me wasn't easy. But I needed to hear it. Why didn't you just tell me how you felt?
Starlight Glimmer,I didn't want to lose you as a friend.
Trixie,Pfft! Come on! It'd take a lot more than that to lose me. Our friendship is stronger than a few angry words.
Starlight Glimmer,And a magical temper tantrum?
Trixie,"Listen, I'd take that over the boring pony you were becoming any day. The Starlight I love is passionate, lively, and yeah, sometimes angry. Those are my favorite parts of you. That and the fact that you forgive me every time."
Starlight Glimmer,[giggles] I'll forgive you if you forgive me.
Trixie,Deal. [gasps] I remembered what I was thinking about!
Starlight Glimmer,You're kidding me.
Trixie,"There's more to it than that. I was thinking about how glad I am to have met you, and I remembered our first meeting <U+0096> here at the Ponyville spa. And now I just have to teleport it back!"
Starlight Glimmer,No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Spike,"A little to the left. Oh, now rotate it just a hair..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, girls! How'd it go?"
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,[simultaneously] Nothing!
Twilight Sparkle,...What?
Starlight Glimmer,Let's just say I learned a friendship lesson while you were gone.
Twilight Sparkle,"You've barely graduated, and you're already taking initiative! [tearing up] Oh... So proud..."
Fluttershy,We learned about team building and problem solving...
Pinkie Pie,And when not to sing songs!
Rarity,"We certainly had a good time, but I really was looking forward to a spa day, and the Ponyville spa's still open. Anyone?"
Twilight Sparkle,Sounds good to me!
Rainbow Dash,[simultaneously] I have a coupon!
Trixie,We'll meet you there! [to Starlight] Quick! Do you have a spell that will make the spa ponies forget that the map table was there?
Starlight Glimmer,Haven't you learned anything about using magic to solve your problems?
Trixie,"No. If we learned that lesson, how will we ever have fun?"
Nurse Redheart,"Oh, Princess Twilight! Everypony in the hospital is so excited for your visit today!"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm never too busy to visit sick foals. I can't believe a whole class just came down with the horsey hives!
Nurse Redheart,"On school picture day, too."
Nurse Redheart,"Oh, the poor dears really do need cheering up."
Twilight Sparkle,"We'll do our best. We'll bring snacks, I'll read to them, and get them gifts!"
Spike,Food and presents always cheer me up.
Twilight Sparkle,We'll see you soon!
Spike,"Okay, if we want to be at the hospital by lunch, then we have three hours to buy get-well presents, borrow a book from the schoolhouse, [sighing] and pick up treats."
Twilight Sparkle,"It's a lot, but if we stick to the schedule, I know we can get it all done."
Spike,"Yeah, knock on wood."
Shining Armor,Surprise!
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Oh, my gosh! How's my favorite niece?"
Shining Armor,"[as Flurry Heart] ""I'm good! I was hoping my favowite aunt could watch me for a few houwrs."""
Princess Cadance,Hope you're not too busy.
Twilight Sparkle,Busy? [scoffs] Would the best aunt ever be too busy to spend time with this adorable little one?
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Twilight Sparkle,[blows raspberry] Flurry! I've got a surprise for you!
Twilight Sparkle,Just a couple of toys that reminded me of Flurry.
Twilight Sparkle,I'm excited to show you I've done some shopping for Flurry Heart.
Princess Cadance,"Oh-ho-ho, you're so sweet. You didn't have to do all that."
Twilight Sparkle,"I know, but I can't help myself! Best aunt ever! Open this one, Flurry."
Shining Armor,"We'll just put Flurry's things over here, Twily!"
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-huh. Totally.
Shining Armor,"Mashed peas, her favorite."
Princess Cadance,"And diapers. Uh, extra diapers. Oh, and backup extra diapers. Heh."
Shining Armor,"Mashed peas, her favorite. Wait, did I say that already?"
Spike,Uh-huh.
Shining Armor,Oops.
Princess Cadance,"Oh, and this is the most important thing of all <U+0096> her Whammy."
Spike,I take it Flurry named it?
Princess Cadance,"Yup. If she gets fussy, just give her the Whammy and she'll calm right down."
Shining Armor,"You getting all this, Twily?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Whammy. Got it. Where are you guys headed, anyway?"
Shining Armor,"You remember my friend from the royal guard, Spearhead?"
Spike,"Honestly, all of your friends' names are very similar."
Shining Armor,"Well, he has a pop-up art show at the Ponyville Cafe, and we decided to go at the last minute."
Princess Cadance,"We're not exactly art enthusiasts, but we could really use a night out."
Spike,"You mean ""day""?"
Princess Cadance,That's what I said! Isn't that what I said?
Spike,Mmm... Mm-mm.
Princess Cadance,"Either way, are you sure you can watch her?"
Spike,Uh-uh-uh!
Twilight Sparkle,Mmmmh...
Twilight Sparkle,Have no fear! The best aunt ever has everything under control!
Shining Armor,"Thanks again, Twily."
Spike,"Okay, let's grab that Whummy thing and go."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, you want to pretend we're the bears. I suppose we have time for a quick game."
Spike,"Do we, though?"
Twilight Sparkle,Hey! All right! [growls like a bear] I'm gonna get ya!
Spike,"Ugh! [sighs] You should catch her soon, 'cause we've got lots to do! Horsey-hives-covered foals counting on us, remember?"
Twilight Sparkle,Got it! [growls like a bear] I'm catching up!
Flurry Heart,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh-oh. Sorry, bug. Did that scare you? It's okay. It's just Auntie Twily!"
Flurry Heart,[blows raspberry] Bleh!
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, that was a very advanced spell for somepony your age. Looks like you're already taking after your Auntie Twily."
Spike,"All right, that was pretty adorable. But now..."
Twilight Sparkle,"I know, Spike, we're leaving."
Twilight Sparkle,I just have to feed her real quick.
Shining Armor,Is this art or... a mistake?
Princess Cadance,I have no idea. But who cares? We're not changing diapers.
Spearhead,"Shining Armor! Cadance! How are the new 'rents? Gimme some hoof. Oh, it is so [grunt] good [grunt] to see you dudes! Hey, thanks for coming."
Shining Armor,Of course! We're having a great time! Loving all the... art!
Spearhead,"Uh, that's a trash can."
Shining Armor,So it is! I knew that!
Spearhead,"But hey, who's to say it's not art? Art can be anything that speaks to you. It changed my world. This is my latest piece <U+0096> ""A Thousand Nights in a Hallway""."
Princess Cadance,"Wow, I guess nighttime in a hallway can be pretty dark."
Spearhead,[seriously] There is none more dark.
Shining Armor,[baffled] Yeah. Totally.
Princess Cadance,We're just so happy to be here. Usually we're covered in mashed peas by now.
Spike,When they said mashed peas were her favorite...
Spike,...did they mean her favorite thing to decorate a room with?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Aw, come on, Spike. That wasn't too bad."
Spike,"Yeah, and we're only twenty minutes behind schedule."
Twilight Sparkle,Twenty minutes?! [exhales] It's fine. We can totally do this.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, we just need to grab some toys and we are outta here."
Twilight Sparkle,"You want to play, don't you? Well, I know a game that's even more fun! [aside to Spike] And more efficient. [to Flurry Heart] Playing race carts! Ha-ha!"
Twilight Sparkle,Woo-hoo!
Spike,"[panting] [out of breath] Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Best aunt ever! Hang on, Flurry. The race cart's taking a pit stop."
Spike,"I'm not a detective, but I think we got a suspect."
Twilight Sparkle,"Huh?! [sighs] Well, we'd better get to cleaning. We've got no time to waste!"
Salespony,"Thanks, but they were organized by color."
Twilight Sparkle,[panting] Yes! We gained back a whole five minutes from running here!
Spike,"Yeah, but if you add that to the forty minutes we were already behind... we're still... fifty five minutes behind!"
Spike,"I mean... [nervous chuckle] Yay, team?"
Twilight Sparkle,Mm-hmm!
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks for helping us out, Cheerilee. Sorry we were late."
Cheerilee,"Oh, no problem. But I gotta say, I'm surprised you came to me for a book. Don't you have a huge collection?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, but<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, one second."
Twilight Sparkle,I didn't think the foals would be interested in The Unabridged History of Amulets in pony Latin.
Cheerilee,"Yeah, it was good you came to me. How about the complete collection of Ponyville Fables and Stables?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Mmm, too long."
Cheerilee,Alien Alicorns vs. Space Pirates?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, the science there is preposterous<U+0097>"
Spike,"How about Burnferno, Warrior from Within? It's about a handsome dragon warrior who slays evildoers with his breath and his snappy comebacks!"
Twilight Sparkle,[giggles] Let's borrow that for you and keep looking.
Spike,Eh.
Twilight Sparkle,What else?
Cheerilee,"Uh, how about Gusty the Great?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ooh, that was one of my favorites when I was a filly! We'll take it!"
Flurry Heart,Ta-da!
Twilight Sparkle,"Cheerilee, I am so, so sorry! I didn't even hear her leave!"
Twilight Sparkle,"There, all clean."
Cheerilee,Great. Now I'll just write it up again...! [slightly muffled] With my mouth.
Twilight Sparkle,Ehh...
Spearhead,"Feast your eyes. This one's called ""A Kitchen Guard's Journey""!"
Princess Cadance,[unsure] Oh...
Shining Armor,"This reminds me of the time Flurry got into the chocolate pudding, and we found little chocolate hoofprints all over the carpet."
Princess Cadance,That took forever to clean up! But remember how cute her little face looked when we caught her?
Shining Armor,"Yeah. She was like, [imitating Flurry Heart] ""Uh-oh!"""
Spearhead,"Whoa, art is so evocative! I wasn't even going for that memory! Score!"
Spike,"Honestly, Twilight, I don't even want to tell you how late we are. Should I just cancel our visit to the hospital?"
Twilight Sparkle,"What?! Cancel?! We can't cancel, Spike! The sick foals are counting on us! And the B.A.E. would never throw in the towel like that!"
Spike,B.A.E.?
Twilight Sparkle,"""Best Aunt Ever""? Besides, this errand is gonna be different."
Spike,How do you figure that?
Twilight Sparkle,Because Flurry can play with the Cake twins and stay out of trouble! Best aunt ever!
Twilight Sparkle,Wonderful! They're friends already!
Spike,Huh. I shouldn't have doubted you.
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks! Wait, you doubted me?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, you watch Flurry. I'll take care of everything else. [quickly, to Pinkie Pie] Hi, Pinkie! How's it going? I need to pick up the cupcakes for the foals at the hospital! And can you do apology treats?"
Pinkie Pie,I'm good. Here they are. Of course I can!
Twilight Sparkle,Do you still have a giant file on everypony's favorite treat?
Pinkie Pie,In my secret party planning cave!
Pinkie Pie,BRB!
Twilight Sparkle,Hee-hee! Remind me to tell you later how amazing you are. Cheerilee?
Pinkie Pie,Eh. I am pretty awesome.
Pinkie Pie,Cherry oatmeal cookies with yellow sprinkles.
Twilight Sparkle,"Great! Can you write ""sorry"" on them?"
Pinkie Pie,I've got a stamp for that!
Spike,"Hey, you guys! No need to fight! Uh... Hang on! I'm sure there's another one! Ugh, no, not this one... Oh, that's cute..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hold on, sweetie. We'll play in a second."
Twilight Sparkle,The salespony at the toy store...
Pinkie Pie,Apple strudel cupcake with caramel drizzle!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, no. You're making the same face Cheerilee made. Pinkie, remind me what your favorite treat is."
Pinkie Pie,Mmm... The sampler platter.
Twilight Sparkle,We'll take three of those.
Spike,Uh... Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,Out of the question! We are not cancelling! It's going to be okay! It has to be okay! It's been so terrible so far it can't possibly end up<U+0097> Oh...
Spike,"Uh, sorry."
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] No, I needed it."
Spike,"I was just gonna say, we're here."
Spike,And we're only four-and-a-half minutes late!
Twilight Sparkle,Four and a half?!
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""...and while nopony had ever tried to reach Cloudsdale on hoof, Gusty the Great was not deterred! She and her unicorn warriors marched up the hill. But suddenly, they encountered..."""
Spike,[gasps] What?! What was it?!
Twilight Sparkle,"""It was the treacherous Grogar..."""
Twilight Sparkle,"""...and Gusty could tell he was ready for battle. Gusty called out to the unicorn warriors<U+0097>"" Ow! Not right now, Flurry. These foals really want to hear this."
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""'We can fight Grogar together!' And the unicorn warriors shot magical beams into the clouds that wove into one! The beam, stronger than a thousand armies, shined down!"""
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""It wrapped around Grogar and pulled him to the ground! 'Don't let him escape!', yelled Gusty!"""
Nurse Redheart,Say 'ah'.
Cherry Fizzy,Ahhh<U+0097>
Cherry Fizzy,<U+0097>aaargh!
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""Grogar was strong, for fear gave him power, and he broke through the bonds!"""
Twilight Sparkle,"I know! So good, right?"
Spike,"Twilight, look up!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, you're floating. You're floating!"
Spike,So are you!
Twilight Sparkle,"Flurry, honey, you need to stop this. Put us down, please."
Spike,"Twilight, look out!"
Twilight Sparkle,Nopony panic! Everything's gonna be okay!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I can't keep up with her!"
Spike,"Oh, yeah, where's her Snoozle?!"
Twilight Sparkle,Her what?!
Spike,"You know, her Whacky Whompy thing? The snail? Where is it? Cadance said it calms her down."
Twilight Sparkle,I don't see it!
Twilight Sparkle,Flurry Heart! Put us all down this instant!
Twilight Sparkle,Is everypony okay?
Twilight Sparkle,"Flurry, that was very, very bad! You could have hurt somepony!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Flurry, I didn't mean to<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Sweetie, you don't have to be scared. It's just me, see?"
Twilight Sparkle,"You're scared of me. Because I yelled at you like a big scary bear. Flurry, I'm so sorry. I've been a terrible aunt today. All you wanted to do was play, and I've barely been able to pay attention to you. None of this is your fault. It's mine. So much for being the best aunt ever. But I hope you know how much I love you."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I take it you forgive me?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks, Flurry. How about we head home? After we find your Whammy, of course."
Princess Cadance,[tearing up] This one kind of reminds me of Flurry's hair.
Shining Armor,[tearing up] Uh-huh. And this one reminds me of Flurry too.
Spearhead,How so?
Shining Armor,"It's small... like her! I-I can't do this anymore! Spearhead, this has been great, but<U+0097>"
Spearhead,Say no more. My art has always spoken to me about what I love. But knowing that it spoke to you about what you love speaks to me.
Shining Armor,What...?
Spearhead,Go to her.
Shining Armor,"Flurry?! Where's our little foal?! Ah! Oh, we missed you so much!"
Princess Cadance,But it looks like you had a great time without us.
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, not so much. Flurry got into some mischief, but it wasn't her fault. I shouldn't have agreed to watch her with such a jam-packed schedule. It was too much to juggle. But Flurry taught me an important lesson today. It turns out being the best aunt ever isn't about spending the most time with your niece, but spending quality time with her. And she taught me a really cool bear game, so I guess I learned two things."
Shining Armor,"Well, we definitely should've given you more of a heads up."
Princess Cadance,"Yes! From now on, we'll give you plenty of notice."
Twilight Sparkle,"Ohh, that would be great."
Princess Cadance,"Hey, what are you doing next Tuesday?"
Princess Cadance,"For dinner, not to babysit."
Twilight Sparkle,"[chuckle] I'll have to check with Spike, but I think we're free."
Princess Cadance,"Where is Spike, anyway?"
Spike,"[reading] ""The dashing dragon warrior breathed a scorching flame from his snout, then chuckled to himself as he flew into the sunset. 'If you can't stand the heat, don't fight a dragon!'"""
Others,"""Peach Fuzz"": Hey, you kinda look like him!"
Spike,"Thank you! Okay, now who wants more cake?"
Rusty Tenure,"So in closing, earning a rocktorate in rock studies from the Equestrian Institute of Rockology is no easy feat. I'm proud of each and every one of you. Uh... each of... No, just you, actually."
Pinkie Pie,"Go, Maud! Woo-hoo! Number one! Number one!"
Rusty Tenure,"Fillies and gentlecolts... and is that magnesium-rich basalt? It is my honor to present our vale-rock-torian, Maud Pie. Excuse me. Doctor Pie."
Pinkie Pie,"Whoo! Doctor Pie! Doctor Pie! ...""Rock-tor"" Pie?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'm Maud.
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, you are! Brilliant speech! Encore! Encore!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] There's more, Pinkie. I'm Maud. [flips index card] Pie. Thank you."
Pinkie Pie,You are so welcome! Brilliant speech! Encore! Encore! Encore!
Pinkie Pie,"[long high-pitched squeal, rapidly] You're moving to Ponyville! We'll live together and get bunk beds and I'll make us fuzzy slippers that say ""Best Sister Friends Forever"", although I probably can't fit all those words on a slipper, so maybe just ""BSFF"", but we don't have to decide right now because we'll be together all the time since when it comes to Ponyville, the doctor is in!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Slow down, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,Yooooouuuuu'rrrrrrrreeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmooooooooovvvvvvvviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggggg tttttttooooooo Pooooooooooonnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyvvvvvvviiiiiiilllllllleeeeeeeee....
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'm not definitely moving to Ponyville.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'm also considering Ghastly Gorge.
Pinkie Pie,[laughs] Classic Maud sense of humor! You should do stand-up!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I do. But that wasn't a joke.
Pinkie Pie,"[gasps] Ghastly Gorge? That terrible, awful, no-fun, all-alone canyon in the middle of nowhere?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] There or Ponyville.
Pinkie Pie,"But Ponyville is so ""eee-hee-hee-hee-hee!"" and Ghastly Gorge is so ""Blegh!"""
Maud Pie,[deadpan] It's a rock-based decision.
Pinkie Pie,But what about BSFFs?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] That's why I'm giving Ponyville a chance.
Pinkie Pie,"Phew! So all I have to do is prove Ponyville has better rocks than Ghastly Gorge? Challenge accepted. We'll drop your stuff off at my place, and then hold onto your world, 'cause it's about... to... get... rocked!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Okay.
Pinkie Pie,"Ghastly Gorge may have rocks, but our gem cave rocks!"
Pinkie Pie,"Huh? Huh? Oh, and look! You'll never know who you'll see!"
Rarity,"[gasps] Maud, darling! It's lovely to see you again! Oh! Congratulations on your rocktorate. What are you doing now?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Talking to you.
Rarity,"Oh, y<U+0097> Right. [laughs, clears throat] Well, if your trained eye happens to see a chartreuse gem, I'm desperate to find one."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I found one.
Rarity,"Oh, you're an absolute darling! This will surely make my gown stand out at Countess Coloratura's album release party. Do you know how rare this is?"
Pinkie Pie,Just another day in Ponyville!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] That's actually a really common gem.
Pinkie Pie and Rarity,Huh?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] These are all really common gems.
Pinkie Pie,"They are? Uh, I mean, heh, come on! Of course they are! That's why I didn't bring you here to impress you! I wanted to make sure you had a chance to, heh, say ""hello"" to your old pal... Spike!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Hello, Spike."
Pinkie Pie,"Way to go, Maud! Cross that off the to-do list! Y'know what I'm sayin'? Check! Now, let's get moving, 'cause I'm about to show you something that'll make you yell ""All right!"""
Maud Pie,[deadpan] All right.
Pinkie Pie,See? Ha-ha!
Pinkie Pie,Ta-da! It's a castle... made of rocks! Whaaaat?! Did I just blow your mind? I think I just blew your mind.
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] A lot of structures are made from rocks, Pinkie. They're a very stable building material."
Pinkie Pie,"But this place grew out of nowhere after a magical key-build gem followed a rainbow and buried itself in the ground! I mean, have you ever seen rocks like this?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Yes.
Pinkie Pie,"No, you haven't!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] We literally just saw hundreds of them in the gem cave.
Pinkie Pie,"But... but... Oh, look at those rocks!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Those are sting-bush seed pods.
Pinkie Pie,"So they are! But, uh... look at that rock! It's even got four smaller rocks around it like legs!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] That's a tortoise.
Pinkie Pie,[sighs] I guess you won't be moving to Ponyville after all. Those rocks at Ghastly Gorge don't know how lucky they are to have you.
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the only reason I'm considering Ponyville."
Pinkie Pie,You said it's a rock-based decision.
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] I'm obviously passionate about exotic rocks, but I've always studied them... alone. I could handle some less exciting rocks if it meant I'd have somepony to talk to besides Boulder."
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Are you saying you want... a friend?!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I wouldn't mind one.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] It isn't hard to meet somepony I like. It's finding somepony who gets me.
Pinkie Pie,I get you.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You're my sister. It's different.
Pinkie Pie,"Maud, you are the best! You never know when the lightning of friendship will strike. Somepony could come barreling through that door at this very moment and become your best friend!"
Pinkie Pie,"Y'know, I really thought somepony was gonna come barreling through that<U+0097>"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Uh.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, my fault! Totally my fault! Are you okay? I should've been watching where I was going, and<U+0097> You look really familiar. Have we met before?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Yes.
Starlight Glimmer,I knew it!
Pinkie Pie,Whaaaaat?!
Starlight Glimmer,"No, no, don't tell me. Um..."
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah. See, I was really hoping you'd tell me while I pretended to remember."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I traveled Equestria for my rocktorate dissertation.
Starlight Glimmer,Psst! Do you know a lot about rocks?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Yes.
Starlight Glimmer,Have you ever come across some kind of super-powerful stone that can store the cutie mark magic of... I don't know... an entire village?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Yep. In the big cave.
Pinkie Pie,"[laughs] Hey, I got an idea. Let's not tell anypony that part where you maybe, for sure, accidentally helped Starlight enslave a town! [laughs, seriously] Tell nopony!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] It's not like she's enslaved anypony lately.
Pinkie Pie,[through the side of her mouth] Offer to help.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] What?
Pinkie Pie,Offer to help!
Starlight Glimmer,You wanna help?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Do I?
Pinkie Pie,Of course you do! Go!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Okay.
Pinkie Pie,"[squeals] They're totally gonna be best friends and then Maud will choose Ponyville, and we'll get to wear BSFF slippers!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Rocks take on different properties when interacting with magic. With the right stone, you could rule all of Equestria if you wanted to."
Starlight Glimmer,You're messing with me.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Am I?
Starlight Glimmer,"[laughs, sighs] So other than rocks, what else are you into?"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Minerals. Plate tectonics. Oh, and stand-up comedy, of course."
Starlight Glimmer,I like... kites.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Kites are cool.
Starlight Glimmer,"The trick with an S.L.K. is not to make the spars too heavy. But if they're too light, you've got no ballast and then good luck tacking against the A.O.I.! [beat] I really like kites."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] They're starting to grow on me.
Pinkie Pie,"Pizza delivery! Oh! Maud and Starlight? You're here too? Whoa-ho-ho! What a coincidence! 'Cause I was just, y'know, delivering this pizza to, um... you!"
Pinkie Pie,So how's it going?
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, just hanging out<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"Hey! You could use this time to bond and talk about feelings! For example, do you feel like you're becoming friends?"
Starlight Glimmer,Um... I feel... like I don't want to talk about feelings?
Pinkie Pie,"Great! I'll go next. I feel like I love that you two are becoming best friends! I mean, your friendship could be the friendship that makes Maud move to Ponyville! No pressure, Starlight. Um, hello? Where'd you two go?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Sorry about my sister. There's no half-excited with her.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, I know. But she always calms down. Eventually."
Starlight Glimmer,Why do you find rocks so fascinating?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Each one has a different story to tell. Like Boulder here. This tells me he's over two thousand years old. [to Boulder] You don't look a day over six hundred.
Starlight Glimmer,Wow. You can tell that from a line?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I didn't get a rocktorate because I can shred on guitar like nopony else.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Another reason I like rocks <U+0096> they don't exclude you if you're... different than other ponies.
Starlight Glimmer,"They're beautiful and strong, but they don't judge you or make you feel less than in any way. I think I'm starting to like rocks, too."
Starlight Glimmer,It's hollow?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] It's granite. Hollow granite is highly unusual.
Starlight Glimmer,Wow! Have you ever seen anything like this?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] No. And that's unusual. For me.
Pinkie Pie,There you are! I thought you went your separate ways but you can't imagine how happy I am to find you both together and to witness one of your firsts as friends!
Pinkie Pie,"First time discovering an underground cavern! [squeals] I can't wait 'til you're old and eating pistachios together and telling your grand-foals about this! Oh, no! They're not bonding!"
Pinkie Pie,I got an idea!
Pinkie Pie,[exaggerated] Whooaa! I'm tripping on a rock at this very moment! And now I'm falling down!
Pinkie Pie,"[exaggerated] Oh, no! My accidental clumsiness has trapped us here! Where you'll be forced to bond until we're rescued."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, we won't have to wait for that. There's gotta be a spell that<U+0097>"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan, to Boulder] Get us out of here, boy."
Starlight Glimmer,"Boulder, that was awesome!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] No. That was sandstone.
Starlight Glimmer,"More sand than stone, apparently."
Pinkie Pie,"I'm thinking you wear these around your neck at all times so I don't lose you again, you sillies! That way, I can track your progress as friends!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh! And tomorrow, we can have a friendship brunch! What's your favorite kind of omelette cupcake?! [hushed] Mine's jalape<f1>o red velvet!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah, um, I-I don't know if I can make it."
Pinkie Pie,You'll change your minds when you smell the yummy food! Come on!
Starlight Glimmer,Oops.
Pinkie Pie,"Tomorrow's brunch is going to be the scrumptiest, brunchiest, munchiest brunch ever!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Yeah. About that...
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Zero times.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Maud, don't be so hard on yourself! You've got the best friendship-maker in Ponyville on the case! I'll be by your side the whole time! Speaking of which, your bell fell off, silly!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Pinkie Pie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,Buuuuuut?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] [sighs] Never mind.
Pinkie Pie,"Don't worry, Maud. When you see this brunch, you'll realize everything's gonna be okay! And then, I have amazing bonding activities planned for the next seventeen days! You and Starlight will be besties in no time! Goodnight! [kisses] [clap, clap] [snoring] ...Cupcake omelette..."
Pinkie Pie,Friendship brunch!
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] [voiceover] Pinkie Pie. Thank you for trying so hard to help me make friends. But my decision has to be rock based. And Ghastly Gorge has such great rocks, I won't even have time for friends. It's better this way. Sorry it didn't work out. Maud."
Pinkie Pie,Maud! Wait!
Pinkie Pie,Maud! [tearing up] Maud...
Pinkie Pie,"Starlight, wake up!"
Starlight Glimmer,[yelps] Kites!
Starlight Glimmer,"Huh? Oh. If this is about brunch, I-I, uh... You know what? Jalape<f1>o red velvet omelettes sound gross. I-I just can't."
Pinkie Pie,Maud left in the middle of the night!
Starlight Glimmer,Oh. I guess Ghastly Gorge really does have the best rocks.
Pinkie Pie,[sniffs] Why couldn't you two just be friends?
Starlight Glimmer,"Pinkie Pie, I like Maud."
Pinkie Pie,You do?
Starlight Glimmer,Yeah. She's weird!
Pinkie Pie,Hey!
Starlight Glimmer,"No, in a good way! She sees the world in a totally different way than anypony I've ever met. She accepts me for who I am. She taught me that a rock is never just a rock, and she could make anything funny. We never had to say it, but we got each other."
Pinkie Pie,You really were becoming friends?
Starlight Glimmer,"I think so, but you kinda sorta... got in the way."
Starlight Glimmer,"[gasps] You're right, too harsh. Let's go with... You ruined everything all the time?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Mmmmh, that's worse. What I'm trying to say is<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,[tearing up] I have to go!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Sigh.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Emerald jasper? This must be my lucky day.
Pinkie Pie,[sniffs] [licks] [chews] Maud tracks!
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Hello, Pinkie Pie. I found emerald jasper."
Pinkie Pie,"Are you okay, Maud?! That eel almost ate you!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] What eel?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You didn't need to come. I'm having a great time on my own.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I even made a new friend.
Pinkie Pie,Is it a rock?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Yes.
Pinkie Pie,[shrieks] Maud!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I don't belong in Ponyville. It only proved I'm better off all by myself. Like I always have been.
Pinkie Pie,"Don't say that! It was all my fault! I<U+0097> [shrieks] I thought I knew everything about making friends, but I didn't even know my own sister! I forced you to do things my way, but my way isn't your way!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] This way.
Pinkie Pie,Exactly!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] No. This way.
Pinkie Pie,"Maud, I thought you couldn't make a friend without my help, but it turns out you couldn't make a friend with my help. I underestimated you, and I'm sorry."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I know you did it out of love. You're my best sister friend forever.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] And you melt my heart more easily than sodium-rich plagioclase feldspar.
Pinkie Pie,"[sniffs] I don't know what that means, but please please please please please give Ponyville another chance! But more importantly, give me another chance... to leave you alone."
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] What do you think, Boulder?"
Starlight Glimmer,You're back!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Mm-hmm.
Starlight Glimmer,For good?
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Mm-hmm. This doesn't mean we need to start talking about feelings, does it?"
Starlight Glimmer,Heh. No way.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Maybe after this we could decorate my new place.
Starlight Glimmer,Totally! Where is it?
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Well, it's not in Ponyville. More like Ponyville-adjacent."
Starlight Glimmer,It's perfect.
Pinkie Pie,"Sorry, sorry, I'm leaving! I promise. I'm not even here. Aah, you're wearing the slippers! Okay, now I'm really leaving. Buh-bye!"
Fluttershy,Oh! Be careful!
Fluttershy,"[gasps] Are you okay, Angel?"
Fluttershy,"I told you that entering the Ponyville Parkour Contest was a dangerous idea. You just rest here, and I'll have you all fixed up in no time. Oh, dear. I'm all out of bunny foot braces. I think we need to pay a visit to Dr. Fauna."
Fluttershy,"[straining] Oh, I was sure she would be here today."
Fluttershy,Hello? [knocks on door] Is anypony there?
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. [muffled] Fluttershy? Oh, am I glad to see you!"
Fluttershy,"[straining] I wish I could say the same, but the door's stuck, so I, um... can't see you."
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. Ohhhh. Somebunny hurt his foot. Let's bandage that up so he can get back home. I'd like to keep him overnight, but as you can see, my place is just bursting with animals! [exhale] I don't think I can take in even one more critter right now!"
Fluttershy and Dr. Fauna,"Fluttershy and Dr. Oh, dear."
Fluttershy,[gasps] You really have your hooves full here.
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. [sighs] This place is like a zoo! Then again, it's normally like that, but still... I can't keep up!"
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. Oh. Now, does my favowite wittle bunny want a carrot pop?"
Dr. Fauna,Dr. [sighs] That's okay. I think the goats ate all of them anyway.
Fluttershy,I just can't believe all these poor little animals are hurt. What happened?
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. I'm flummoxed! Every day, there's more and more animals on my doorstep. Most of them just have minor ailments <U+0096> hurt wings, stuffy noses, and such. But the trouble is even after they're all healed up, I can't seem to get these comfy critters to leave!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, dear."
Fluttershy,They do seem to have made themselves right at home here.
Dr. Fauna,Dr. I wonder why they chose to flock to my office. It just doesn't make sense.
Fluttershy,"Don't be silly, Dr. Fauna. You're the best vet pony in Equestria. At least that's what I've been telling everypony."
Dr. Fauna,Dr. Uh... you did what?
Fluttershy,"Oh, no. Do you suppose it's my fault? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. I just know animals feel safe and happy under your care."
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. Normally, I don't mind if a snake wants to slither in or a raccoon needs a rest, but now this place is so full, I have no space to treat any injured animals."
Fluttershy,That is a big problem... that I'm going to fix for you! I already have the perfect solution that'll make the critters happy and give you more space. Then you'll have all your ducks in a row!
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. The sooner you fix it, the better!"
Fluttershy,I'm on it!
Fluttershy,I want to thank you all for rushing right over when I called.
Fluttershy,Dr. Fauna needs my help with a serious problem.
Twilight Sparkle,A friendship problem?
Fluttershy,"No. Her vet clinic is a bit... maybe, um... overrun with adorable critters in dire need of a safe place to lay their heads, and... they don't have anywhere to go!"
Rarity,"Oh, that's just awful."
Fluttershy,I know!
Applejack,"Yeah. Dr. Fauna's always fixin' Winona up when she ain't feelin' too fine, so helpin' her out is A-okay by me."
Rainbow Dash,Hah! Yeah!
Rarity,You can count on us!
Pinkie Pie,[simultaneously] Okie-dokie-lokie!
Twilight Sparkle,[simultaneously] Okay!
Fluttershy,"Oh, that's great news! Because it means you'll all be helping me with something special, too. Something that's been a dream of mine for a long time."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, goody! Is your dream to make a bouncy castle shaped like a gigantic bundt cake?"
Fluttershy,"Um, no. Not exactly."
Pinkie Pie,Huh. Just me then.
Rainbow Dash,"So? What is it, Fluttershy? Spill!"
Fluttershy,My dream is to build a real animal sanctuary.
Fluttershy,"A beautiful habitat where every animal <U+0096> whether sick or scared or even just lonely, feathered or furry, scaly or slimy <U+0096> every critter would be welcome. My sanctuary can be the one place in Equestria they call home 'til they feel ready to take on the world."
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow, Fluttershy! I've never heard you speak with such conviction."
Rarity,Oh! That was exquisite!
Rainbow Dash,Pretty awesome.
Fluttershy,"Oh, thank you, everypony. You all taught me so much about building my confidence over the years. It's because of your friendship that I finally feel able to make my dream project a reality. But I can't build the sanctuary alone. Will you join me?"
Applejack,"I'm happy to offer my extra hooves to ya. Huh. But come to think of it, I actually know a filly who'd be more help than I would. She's a friend of mine from Winona's sheep-herdin' competitions <U+0096> Wrangler! Heh. She's an expert in animal enclosures."
Fluttershy,How lovely!
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh-ooh-ooh! I know somepony, too! Hard Hat is the best construction pony in Ponyville. He can build anything you could ever, ever, ever want!"
Fluttershy,"Is it you, Rarity?"
Rarity,"[chuckles] No! No. Um, I was referring to the premiere interior designer of the Canterlot elite <U+0096> Dandy Grandeur. He helped me when I was setting up my Canterlot boutique. I know that he'd be thrilled to work with you."
Fluttershy,"Wow, everypony! Thank you! I can't wait to meet all of them and hear their ideas. We're right on track to building the most wonderful sanctuary in Equestria!"
Fluttershy,"Thank you, Rupert. Ahem. It's wonderful that you all could join me to discuss the Ponyville sanctuary project. My friends have so many nice things to say about each of your talents. This is a big project, so I'm happy to have such experienced ponies working on it with me."
Dandy Grandeur,"Rarity has impeccable taste in design and friends, so I can't wait to work with you, you know?"
Fluttershy,I-I think so.
Wrangler,"Yee-haw! I'm just lookin' forward to helpin' ya out, ma'am! And the animals."
Fluttershy,Of course.
Hard Hat,"So, uh, Pinkie Pie said you drew up some blueprints?"
Fluttershy,"Um, not exactly. It's more of a dream board."
Hard Hat,"Hmmm, that sure doesn't look like an animal hospital."
Fluttershy,"Well, that's because it's not. It's a sanctuary. A place that is safe but not restrictive. Cozy but natural. A place where the animals can come and go as they please."
Fluttershy,"So, can you build it?"
Others,"Wrangler, Hard Hat, [chuckling nervously] Uhhh..."
Fluttershy,"I want the sanctuary to have an open floor plan. No walls. More like an enclosure that melts into the trees. With a gate in the back. That way, the animals can return to the forest right when they feel ready."
Pinkie Pie,Sneaky! I like it!
Hard Hat,"You know, uh, I designed the Ponyville Hospital. I could do the exact same thing right here. I still have the blueprints. Though it'll take a while to clear all these trees."
Fluttershy,But I don't want to clear the trees. I want to use them.
Hard Hat,Are you sure? What you're talking about doesn't really seem like a cohesive structure. Or any structure I'm familiar with.
Fluttershy,"Critters don't live the same way ponies do. I know this is unconventional, but that's because we're trying to do something that's never been done before. I really believe it'll work."
Hard Hat,Hmm. All right then. I'll see what I can do.
Pinkie Pie,"See, Fluttershy? Whatever you want."
Fluttershy,Good.
Hard Hat,"[to Steam Roller and Jack Hammer] I know she thinks she knows what's best, but once she sees how much better it works with these plans, she'll thank us."
Steam Roller and Jack Hammer,"Uh-huh, yup."
Dandy Grandeur,Which one do you like for the window treatments?
Rarity,Ooooh! Loving the print on those!
Fluttershy,"Um, not to be rude, but there must be some mistake. We have no need for curtains at the sanctuary."
Dandy Grandeur,And whyever not?
Fluttershy,"Everything is gonna look natural in the animal habitats, not like it was made for ponies."
Fluttershy,Drab? You're calling the colors of beautiful trees drab?
Dandy Grandeur,Exactly! The natural look is not in right now. This is better. Trust me.
Fluttershy,"I appreciate your input, but I just know the animals would be happiest with dirt brown pillows and leaf green accents."
Dandy Grandeur,I'll... look into it.
Fluttershy,Thank you.
Dandy Grandeur,...Sometimes they need me to steer them away from it. Especially if it's dirt brown.
Wrangler,"And right there, we got your standard sheep-travelin' cage. Fits two critters, dependin' on size."
Fluttershy,Hmm.
Applejack,"Uh, what is it, sugarcube?"
Fluttershy,I'm looking for something less like a cage and more like a nice hug. Maybe if we lose that part.
Wrangler,"Uh... Well then, it wouldn't be a cage."
Fluttershy,Exactly! Ooh! This is the perfect base for a little nest. I'll take a bunch of these and anything else the animals can burrow into.
Wrangler,You sure you don't want somethin' more secure for the critters?
Applejack,"She does have a point there. You wouldn't want a bunny wanderin' into the wrong cave, would ya?"
Fluttershy,No! No cages. I want to give the animals the freedom to come and go. It's the only way they'll feel comfortable.
Applejack,"Well, she's the boss."
Hard Hat,"Hey, whaddya think, Fluttershy? I told ya we'd be fast. Almost finished with the building already."
Dandy Grandeur,"The color just pops, you know?"
Wrangler,"Quite roomy inside, really. And very safe."
Dandy Grandeur,"Don't keep us waiting, Fluttershy. Do you love it, or do you love it?"
Fluttershy,"I... I... [angry] I don't love it! This is not going to work at all! A giraffe can't fit through this door! With these curtains blocking the light, how are the birds gonna sing in the sunshine? And this is the opposite of a nice hug! I know you all worked hard, but none of you did anything I asked for!"
Hard Hat,[scoffs] That's not true. We used the trees just like you asked!
Dandy Grandeur,And that curtain fabric is organic! It's got natural fibers!
Wrangler,And I added pillows inside my cages. That should count as feelin' like a hug!
Fluttershy,"I may not know much about construction or interior design or wrangling, but I am an expert at one thing: the care of animals! And what animals need is a sanctuary, not this!"
Dandy Grandeur,"Maybe your ""vision"" wasn't all that it was cracked up to be, you know?"
Fluttershy,"My vision isn't the problem here! I told you all exactly what I wanted, and none of you listened to me! So while I appreciate your efforts, I no longer require your services!"
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. Hello! Oh, the animals have been so excited for the sanctuary, they couldn't wait any longer! [laughs] Can we take a look inside?"
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. Oh, I'm so sorry, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,No. I'm the one who should be sorry. This didn't go at all like I had imagined.
Fluttershy,"Sleep tight, little one. It's going to be okay. I promise."
Fluttershy,"Now, now, every mouse has gotta wait their turn."
Fluttershy,[sighs] I'm so sorry. I thought I'd have a beautiful sanctuary for you all to stay in by now. But I put my trust in the wrong ponies.
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. It's okay, Fluttershy. I know you did your best, but we can make this work here. It'll be a bit, uh... tight. Heh. But with your help, we'll have these patients back on their paws in no time, even without a sanctuary."
Fluttershy,No!
Fluttershy,"I won't give up! These animals need me! And I'm gonna solve this once and for all! If this little lady can crawl all the way here from Western Equestria, I can find a way to build her a safe place to rest!"
Fluttershy,Oh! [joins in laughter] Oops. Everyone back to sleep now.
Fluttershy,"Thanks for coming, everypony. As you know, building the sanctuary didn't go quite as planned."
Pinkie Pie,"I know, right? Who would've guessed that Hard Hat wouldn't build whatever you want?"
Rarity,I never would've invited Dandy to help if I thought he'd act in such a manner.
Applejack,"[sighs] And Wrangler sure made a fool outta me, too. I'm sorry, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,It's okay. You were all just trying to help. But I know that letting all the experts go was the right call.
Twilight Sparkle,So what are you gonna do now?
Fluttershy,Try again. I'm going to rebuild the sanctuary and do it my way this time.
Pinkie Pie,"All right, Fluttershy!"
Applejack,"[simultaneously] You show 'em, filly!"
Rarity,[simultaneously] That's the spirit!
Rainbow Dash,How about putting an awesome flying course for the birds right there?
Pinkie Pie,And a carrot cake stand here?
Twilight Sparkle,"Ooh, a library cave?"
Fluttershy,"Everypony, stop! I appreciate you sharing your thoughts, but I need everypony to respect mine. Other ponies may be experts in their fields, but animals are my field of expertise. And if I say this is what I want, then this is what needs to happen! Oh, um, for the animals of course."
Pinkie Pie,"Wow! We should call you ""Flutterbold"" now!"
Fluttershy,"To get things back on track, I called in a favor from an old friend. He'll be here any minute."
Twilight Sparkle,I thought you said no more experts.
Fluttershy,This is one expert I know I can trust to put the animals first. Plus there's nopony better at building.
Big Daddy McColt,[laughs] I heard somepony needs construction help fer them critters!
Twilight Sparkle,Big Daddy McColt! [to the others] We met each other back when the map called me and Fluttershy to the Smokey Mountains!
Fluttershy,And he certainly knows his stuff when it comes to buildings and caring for animals.
Big Daddy McColt,"Well, shucks. Let's not stand around talkin' about it. Let's build us a sanctuary!"
Fluttershy,Are you ready?
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. Oh, I'm more excited than a beaver in a log pile!"
Fluttershy,"Okay, you can open your eyes! Welcome to Sweet Feather Sanctuary, a safe and cozy retreat for everycreature!"
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. [gasps] Oh, Fluttershy! This is amazing!"
Fluttershy,"Now you should have plenty of room at the clinic. Because once you've treated them, they can recover here! With my help, of course. It's okay, Lola. We all move at our own pace. Sometimes, all we need to do is believe in our dreams. And when we finally reach our goal, we'll know that it was worth what it took to get there, because the view will be even better than you imagined!"
Sassy Saddles,"[panting] [muttering] Oh, I have to... Oh! I can't believe the winter-to-spring transition is almost here!"
Sassy Saddles,"Ohhh. I like that. [sighs] I'm going to have to relabel all my binders. Right after we finish... everything! We still have so much to do! Oh, my bustles and bows! Rarity, did we<U+0097>?"
Rarity,"Already hemmed, ruched, and cut, my dear."
Sassy Saddles,"[sighs] Oh. Rarity, no reason to panic, but, um, we seem to be temporarily low! And when I say ""temporarily low"", I mean ""completely out of""<U+0097>!"
Rarity,The baby blue sapphires? They arrived this morning.
Sassy Saddles,Oh. Heh. Wonderful. [sighs] Oh! What about the design for the<U+0097>?!
Rarity,And done!
Sassy Saddles,Wow. You are good. And you've really outdone yourself this time! The Morning Sunshine Tulip Frock is gorgeous!
Rarity,"Ooh, thank you. Look, I know you're worried about something slipping between the cracks. But with your managerial skills and my fabulous designs, we have everything covered."
Sassy Saddles,You're right. You're right. There are no cracks.
Rarity,Would you be a dear and fetch me some vermilion satin from the back? And I'll start on the Eternal Elegance Empire Silhouette evening gown.
Sassy Saddles,My most certain pleasure!
Sassy Saddles,"Rarity, we're running low on vermilion satin."
Sassy Saddles,I... I can order more!
Rarity,"[continues bawling] And this is when we pretended we were storybook princesses. And here we pretended we were on a dangerous yet stylish safari. [sobs] So many wonderful memories! [sobs, blows nose, resumes sobbing] Not to put too fine a point on it, but... [bawls harder] Sweetie Belle loves playing dress-up. I miss her so much!"
Sassy Saddles,Then why don't you go visit her?
Rarity,"[through tears] I wish I... could, but... between... running... three stores and the spring-sition... I couldn't possibly..."
Sassy Saddles,But you've already done almost all the work. I can handle the rest.
Rarity,B-B-But... but...
Sassy Saddles,"Rarity, go. I have everything well in hoof."
Rarity,"[sobs, calmer] Mm, point taken. [excitedly] I am going to visit my sister!"
Sassy Saddles,Way to immediately turn that around.
Rarity,We can spend the whole day together! And we can do all her favorite things!
Sassy Saddles,I'm sure she'd love that.
Rarity,"Oh, Sassy, thank you!"
Sassy Saddles,Of course! Now get out of here!
Rarity,"I'm going! I'm going! Hang on, sis! I'm coming!"
Scootaloo,Excuse us!
Apple Bloom,Comin' through!
Sweetie Belle,Cutie Mark Crusaders mid-mission here!
Scootaloo,That was fun! Let's do it again!
Sweetie Belle,"Scoot, we've got a job to do."
Scootaloo,Later?
Sweetie Belle,"All right, Chipcutter. We've done our part. The rest is up to you."
Chipcutter,You really think I have it in me to be a sculptor?
Scootaloo,Yup!
Chipcutter,But why?
Sweetie Belle,"Because you said you weren't good at anything except getting in trouble for making sculptures out of your lunch, right?"
Chipcutter,"Yeah. I can't help it. When I look at my sandwich, it's like it's just asking me to... turn it into a dragon."
Apple Bloom,"Well, what is this slab asking you to turn it into?"
Chipcutter,Hmmm... I see...
Apple Bloom,Wow! T-That's incredible! It looks just like us!
Scootaloo,"We knew you had it in you, Chip!"
Chipcutter,This is way better than sandwich sculpting!
Sweetie Belle,"Chip, we're proud of you."
Chipcutter,I finally got my cutie mark!
Apple Bloom,Woo-hoo! All right!
Scootaloo,Yes!
Sweetie Belle,Way to go!
Scootaloo,[sighs] Not a bad way to start a day.
Apple Bloom,Not a bad way at all! Helpin' ponies is just about my favorite thing to do.
Sweetie Belle,Another satisfied client!
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,Mm-hmm!
Apple Bloom,So who's up next?
Sweetie Belle,Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill. She needs help reconnecting with her cutie mark <U+0096> three puppy paw prints.
Scootaloo,When is she swinging by?
Sweetie Belle,"Well, I think she should be arriving right about..."
Sweetie Belle,...now.
Apple Bloom,Wow. You are good.
Sweetie Belle,"Come on in, Zipporwhill."
Scootaloo,"Okay, so what seems to be the problem, exactly?"
Zipporwhill,"It's my puppy, Ripley. We used to be so close. In fact, I got my cutie mark the day I found him and took him home. But now, it's like he wants nothing to do with me."
Scootaloo,Don't you worry. You've come to the right place! The Cutie Mark Crusaders are on the job!
Apple Bloom,"Trust us. Before you know it, you and your puppy will be back to bein' besties!"
Sweetie Belle,"You have the CMC guarantee! No matter what it takes, we promise you'll have our full attention."
Rarity,[singsongy] Guess who's here to spend the whole day with her little sister?!
Rarity,Mmmm!
Sweetie Belle,"Rarity, what are you doing here?"
Rarity,"I am here to spend the day with you! I'm so excited, I could practically faint! You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?"
Sweetie Belle,No!
Rarity,"Oh, pfft, of course not. It's a treehouse! That would be tr<e8>s gauche!"
Sweetie Belle,"Right... Well, I sure am happy to see you, and spending the day with you does sound like a lot of fun, but... I'm kind of right in the middle of something important. I have responsibilities and..."
Rarity,Oh.
Apple Bloom,"Go on, Sweetie Belle. We've got this covered. How often do you get to spend time with your sister?"
Scootaloo,Yeah! Go have fun.
Sweetie Belle,You sure you two can handle our client here?
Rarity,"""Client""? Oh, that is so adorable!"
Sweetie Belle,"Uh, thanks? I think?"
Sweetie Belle,Are you sure you two got this?
Apple Bloom,We have it handled.
Rarity,"Oh, my! Look at this wall of satisfied customers! [gasps] You girls really have come a long way."
Sweetie Belle,"Well, all right then. [to the other Crusaders] But, lemme know if you need me or run into any trouble."
Rarity,Ooh! So fun!
Sweetie Belle,[indignantly] What?
Rarity,[giggles] It's just I know how much you love these puppet shows.
Sweetie Belle,I did.
Rarity,"Oh, it's just like old times! You, me, greasy popcorn. It's like no time has passed at all."
Rarity,Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! It's your favorite part!
Rarity,"What's the matter, darling?"
Sweetie Belle,"I, um, guess I just prefer black box experimental theater."
Rarity,What?! Since when?
Sweetie Belle,[sighs] I dunno. It's no big deal. This is great.
Rarity,"Okay. We're here! Ta-da! [laughs, clears throat] Aren't you excited to be back here again? Do I know my baby sister, or do I know my baby sister?"
Sweetie Belle,"Uh... Yeah... Where is ""here"" exactly?"
Rarity,"Oh, pfft! Stop being so silly! You know this is your favorite ice cream shop!"
Sweetie Belle,Oh. Right. From when I was a little filly.
Sweetie Belle,Huh. I remember it being much bigger.
Rarity,"Well, go ahead. I know you're dying to dig in."
Rarity,Well?
Sweetie Belle,"[laughs nervously, sighs] That was, uh... one tasty bite. Still a little hungry, though."
Rarity,"[gasps] We can get another sundae! Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, perhaps?"
Sweetie Belle,I was thinking something more like a salad.
Rarity,A salad? When did you get so practical?
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, um... I guess another scoop would be fine!"
Rarity,"[gasps] One more Filly Clown Surprise, please!"
Zipporwhill,"Hey, Ripley!"
Scootaloo,Look at me! Over here!
Rarity,"I know you must be bored, darling. This is a very long line for one of Twisty Pop's balloons."
Rarity,"But just be patient. We'll get you your favorite balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it."
Zipporwhill,[baby noises] Who's a good puppy? Who's a good puppy?! You're the good puppy!
Zipporwhill,"Now come on, puppy-wuppy! Get the bally-wally!"
Scootaloo,"Come on, Ripley! Like this!"
Apple Bloom,Good Scootaloo! See?
Zipporwhill,[sighs] It's not working.
Scootaloo,Maybe if the ball tasted better?
Apple Bloom,"I don't think that that's it, Scoot."
Sweetie Belle,Doesn't look like it's going so well. I'm just gonna do a quick check with the CMCs.
Rarity,"Well, I guess duty calls, and-and you, you have that now..."
Sweetie Belle,What?
Rarity,"Oh nothing, nothing. Go on."
Scootaloo,"Hey, Sweetie Belle. How's your day with Rarity going?"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, it's not exactly great..."
Apple Bloom,What do you mean?
Sweetie Belle,I don't know. It's like Rarity doesn't even know me anymore.
Scootaloo,I wish we could say our day is going better.
Apple Bloom,But we can't.
Scootaloo,Seems like Zipporwhill's puppy doesn't want anything to do with her.
Sweetie Belle,"Hmmm. I see what you mean... [gasps] You know, it's an awfully big puppy..."
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle, hurry! He's making it!"
Sweetie Belle,Gotta go...
Rarity,[gasps] I know just what to do with this!
Rarity,And pose!
Rarity,And pose!
Rarity,Love the camera!
Rarity,Hate the camera.
Rarity,Love it again!
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle, you did ""hate the camera"" for all these shots! [sighs] Let's do it again."
Sweetie Belle,No!
Apple Bloom,"Come on, Zipporwhill, you can do this!"
Rarity,"W-What do you mean, no?"
Sweetie Belle,"Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but... um..."
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle, what is it? You've been acting weird all day. You used to love doing these things with me."
Sweetie Belle,That's just it! I used to! That's not who I am anymore!
Zipporwhill,"This isn't who I am! My cutie mark must be for something else, because my puppy just doesn't love me anymore! Hmph!"
Rarity,But it is you! You love puppet shows and dressing up and taking silly photos and tiny little clown-shaped ice creams!
Sweetie Belle,"Really?! If you still think I like doing this stuff, then maybe you don't know me at all!"
Rarity,"[sobbing] I can't believe Sweetie Belle talked to me like that. [indignant] And after everything I did to set up a whole day of doing her favorite things! I mean, accusing me of not knowing her?! I know her better than anypony! Um, thank you, Twisty, but the hard truth is, my sister is being unappreciative right now! And I'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind!"
Sweetie Belle,"Hey, Zipporwhill. What are you doing here? Where are Apple Bloom and Scootaloo?"
Zipporwhill,They're with my puppy. He seems to like them better than me anyway.
Sweetie Belle,"Now, I'm sure that's not true."
Sweetie Belle,I think that might be your problem right there! Come on!
Scootaloo,"[groans] Find Zipporwhill, Ripley!"
Apple Bloom,"Woof, woof! It's Zipporwhill! Woof?"
Scootaloo,[sighs] It's hopeless.
Apple Bloom,Sweetie Belle!
Scootaloo,Zipporwhill! [sighs] We're sorry we haven't figured this out yet.
Sweetie Belle,"Don't worry, girls. I think I cracked this one."
Rarity,"Aha! There she is! [gasps] Oh, dear. Really should have changed. [huffs] No matter! I'm going to give her quite the talking to! ...Right after she's done with her conversation. Anger is no excuse for poor manners, after all."
Sweetie Belle,"Okay, Zipporwhill. What do you see?"
Zipporwhill,My puppy?
Sweetie Belle,That's not what I see. I see a full-grown dog.
Zipporwhill,"He did get bigger, I guess."
Sweetie Belle,"He's not just bigger. He's older, too."
Sweetie Belle,"You don't still play with the same toys from when you were a foal, do you?"
Zipporwhill,Oh. Ohhh. The squeaker is a little small for him now. [sighs] It's just hard for me to believe he's not the same adorable little guy I found anymore.
Sweetie Belle,I understand. But doing things like you used to won't turn him back into a puppy.
Zipporwhill,So... what do I do?
Sweetie Belle,"Treat him like the dog he is, and find new favorite things to do together."
Zipporwhill,You think so?
Rarity,I know so!
Sweetie Belle,Rarity?!
Rarity,"Oh, Sweetie Belle. I heard what you said, and you are so right."
Scootaloo,About the dog?
Rarity,"Yes, but about us, too. The truth is, I know you're not a little filly anymore. But it's just... the last time we did all of those things together, I... I didn't realize it was gonna be the last last time. I loved doing those things with you. It's hard for me to let that go."
Sweetie Belle,"Aww, Rarity! I love being with you too! That will never change! But... maybe we could just try to do different things together?"
Zipporwhill,"What is it, puppy? [giggles] I mean, Ripley?"
Zipporwhill,"[giggling] I love you too, Ripley! Thank you, Crusaders."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,No problem!
Zipporwhill,"Oh, Ripley!"
Rarity,"Sweetie Belle, I'm so very proud of the pony you've grown into."
Sweetie Belle,"And I'm proud that no matter what, I'll always be your little sister."
Rarity,"I, uh, have a little bit of time before I have to head back to Canterlot. Could we spend it together? What would a grown pony like you want to do?"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, I do have one idea..."
Rarity,"Heh, I didn't realize your idea would be such a delicious one! [giggles] I don't know how I'm going to finish this."
Sweetie Belle,Oh! I'll help you!
Apple Bloom,[straining] Scootaloo... is this such a... good idea?
Scootaloo,What are you talking about? This is the best idea I've ever had!
Apple Bloom,[grunting] It's just...
Scootaloo,You wanna come. But we talked about this. Non-Pegasus ponies fall through the clouds.
Apple Bloom,"Right, but..."
Sweetie Belle,I think we're good.
Apple Bloom,"We are? Scootaloo, I know you have to go to Cloudsdale to finish your report. I'm just wonderin' if this is the best way to get there."
Scootaloo,"It'll be fine. Besides, how else could I get there?"
Apple Bloom,A Pegasus chariot?
Sweetie Belle,A flock of birds?
Apple Bloom,A hot-air balloon?
Scootaloo,Huh. Those do seem a lot safer. Maybe I should try to find another waaaaaaaaayyyyyy!
Scootaloo,Woo-hoo!
Scootaloo,"[grunts, weakly] Nailed it."
Bow Hothoof,"[echoing] Uh, little ma'am, are you all right?"
Scootaloo,[gasps] You're... You're... You're... Rainbow Dash's dad!
Bow Hothoof,"Uh, yes. Bow Hothoof at your service."
Bow Hothoof,"Uh, honey? Somethin's goin' on out here!"
Windy Whistles,"Oh! Heavens to Celestia, what's wrong with her?!"
Bow Hothoof,"I don't know, but you just made it worse."
Bow Hothoof,She's doing it again!
Windy Whistles,"Oh, dearie, please! You might shatter my Princess Celestia commemorative plates! Ow!"
Bow Hothoof,Our Rainbow Dash?
Scootaloo,"The report's on an inspirational pony in my life, and nopony inspires me more than she does! I'm putting together this scrapbook for my report! I'm her biggest fan!"
Bow Hothoof,"Now, little trotter, what you say is impossible. [excitedly] Because nopony is a bigger fan of our Rainbow Dash than us!"
Scootaloo,Whoa! You always wear that shirt?
Bow Hothoof,"Heh. Actually, it's, uh, laundry day. But pretty great, right?!"
Scootaloo,Yeah!
Windy Whistles,"My name's Windy Whistles, and I just have to say that it is a total blast to meet somepony that loves Rainbow Dash as much as we do!"
Bow Hothoof,What can we help you with?
Scootaloo,"Well, I know all about Rainbow Dash's time in Ponyville, but I don't know anything about her life before that."
Bow Hothoof,"Well, you came to the right place!"
Scootaloo,I can't believe I'm eating Rainbow Dash's favorite food made by Rainbow Dash's mom while sitting in Rainbow Dash's childhood kitchen! This is the greatest day of my life! [munches loudly] Mmmm!
Bow Hothoof,I think it's time for a tour of the house.
Scootaloo,[mouth full] Okay.
Bow Hothoof,Our little Dashie was an early learner and so rambunctious. The combination was<U+0097>
Windy Whistles,[singsongy] Exciting!
Scootaloo,Whoa... Is that... her room?
Scootaloo,"[screams] Rainbow Dash's linen closet! Her carpet! Her inspirational poster! [reading] ""When the going gets tough, the tough don't notice because they have hard shells."" That's so Rainbow Dash!"
Scootaloo,Woo-hoo!
Bow Hothoof,"Scootaloo, wanna see something really cool?"
Bow Hothoof,"Pretty great, huh?"
Scootaloo,So great!
Windy Whistles,And look at this! She was wearing it when she spoke her first words.
Scootaloo,So cool!
Windy Whistles,And this broken lantern is from when she first learned to fly.
Windy Whistles,And this bitten apple is from when she grew her first tooth! [gasps] So many memories!
Scootaloo,You're so lucky to have all of these!
Windy Whistles,"Well, I may have a ton of Dash-mentos, but I don't have any of those ""Rainbow Dash Saves Ponyville"" headlines like you."
Scootaloo,[gasps] Trade-sies?
Windy Whistles,Deal-sies!
Scootaloo,So where's all the Wonderbolt stuff?
Bow Hothoof,You mean Rainbow Dash's personal collection of Wonderbolt memorabilia?
Scootaloo,"No. I mean, where's all the stuff about Rainbow Dash getting accepted into the Wonderbolt Academy and then getting chosen as a Wonderbolt? Wait, you don't know that your daughter's a Wonderbolt? And I got to tell you?!"
Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles,Uhhhhhhhhh...
Scootaloo,"Oh, wow! You should see your faces right now!"
Scootaloo,See? That's what your faces look like.
Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles,Our daughter's a Wonderbolt?!
Bow Hothoof,Great timing.
Scootaloo,Great door.
Windy Whistles,I just... It's... Unbelievable!
Scootaloo,"You two were kind enough to show me the Rainbow Dash you know. Now please, allow me to show you the Rainbow Dash I know."
Spitfire,Let's make some thunder!
Rainbow Dash,I was born to make thunder!
Bow Hothoof,Our baby's a Wonderbolt!
Spitfire,We've got turbulence!
Rainbow Dash,How? Where's it coming from?
Bow Hothoof,I'm so proud!
Misty Fly,There!
Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles,[cheering loudly] She's a Wonderbolt!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, no."
Spitfire,Okay. Which pony broke protocol and invited guests to our training exercises?!
Rainbow Dash,"I guess they're with me. [groans, embarrassed] Mom, Dad. So... good... to see you."
Windy Whistles,"Oh, honey, it's so great to see you, too! And wow! You were so amazing up there with all of that flying!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, how did you know I was here?"
Windy Whistles,"Scootaloo filled us in on everything, you modest pony you!"
Scootaloo,I can't believe I'm documenting the moment your parents first saw you as a Wonderbolt!
Windy Whistles,"And these must be your Wonderbolt friends! Hello, team! I'm Windy Whistles, the mom of the best Wonderbolt ever! Yeah! Just kidding. You guys were great, too! Go, team!"
Rainbow Dash,Moooom!
Spitfire,"Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you."
Windy Whistles,"Nice to meet you as well, and love those goggles! Love 'em! You know, I have goggles, too. But they're mostly just for swimming. Oh, and bath time."
Rainbow Dash,"Mom, please! They don't wanna hear about your bath time!"
Bow Hothoof,"I can't believe it! My daughter, a Wonderbolt! [sobs] So proud!"
Rainbow Dash,"Dad, hold it together. We're in public."
Spitfire,"All right, Wonderbolts! Let's hit the showers and give Rainbow Dash some time to spend with her family."
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, yeah! Uh, great practice! I'll, uh, eh, catch up with you guys in a minute!"
Fleetfoot,"Sir, you really raised a great flyer!"
Bow Hothoof,"Oh, no! [straining] Tears... welling up again!"
Rainbow Dash,Dad!
Rainbow Dash,Could you give us a sec?
Scootaloo,Is something wrong?
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. You should've warned me that you were bringing my parents! Or talked to Twilight or something! Not just shown up!
Scootaloo,Why?
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh! It's just my parents and I have a delicate relationship. I love them very much, and we're really close, but there's a reason I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt! They can be a little bit... embarrassing."
Scootaloo,Huh? Really?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, really! And now you've invited a whole lot of crazy into my life!"
Scootaloo,What's wrong with a little support?
Scootaloo,"Bow and Windy, I'd like you to meet Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle."
Apple Bloom,Hi!
Sweetie Belle,Hello.
Bow Hothoof,"Greetings, small ponies."
Apple Bloom,Are you excited to see Rainbow Dash?
Windy Whistles,"Oh, my, yes! And to think we never bothered to come to a Wonderbolt event!"
Bow Hothoof,"We said if Rainbow Dash isn't a Wonderbolt, then what's the point? But now, she is!"
Scootaloo,"And she earned it! Did you know it all started when she won a spot in the coveted Wonderbolts Academy, training under Spitfire?"
Windy Whistles,I didn't know that! How wonderful!
Scootaloo,"But then, she had some heavy competition. Especially against another Pegasus named Lightning Dust."
Windy Whistles,"Oh, no!"
Scootaloo,"But, of course, Rainbow Dash proved to be the best and later made it into the Wonderbolt Reserves!"
Windy Whistles,Hooray again!
Scootaloo,"But jealous ex-Wonderbolt Wind Rider was worried that Rainbow Dash might break his speed record. And so, he framed her for a crime she didn't commit."
Windy Whistles,"Oh, no!"
Scootaloo,"But thanks to Rarity, Rainbow Dash proved her innocence and became a backup Wonderbolt until Fire Streak retired, and she became an official Wonderbolt!"
Windy Whistles,"Hooray! Wow, what a gripping tale!"
Bow Hothoof,You really know your Rainbow Dash history. You're going to do great on your report.
Apple Bloom,Show's about to start.
Bow Hothoof,"Come on, Bolts! Let's start this thing!"
Windy Whistles,Wonderbolts' Big Showcase! Here! We! Gooooooooo!
Bow Hothoof,Rip it up and tear! It! Down!
Windy Whistles,Then build it back up again and tear it back down again! Yeah!
Bow Hothoof,"Woo! Yeah! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Go go go! Yes! Go, Rainbow Dash! Best Wonderbolt ever!"
Windy Whistles,"Woo-hoo! That's my daughter! Go, Rainbow! Go, Dashie, go-go-go-go-go!"
Windy Whistles,"You go, girl!"
Fleetfoot,"[to Rainbow] Your folks were definitely loud, but they weren't that bad."
Spitfire,Whoa! Since when did we add fireworks to the show?!
Rainbow Dash,"Uhhhh, we didn't."
Fleetfoot,Wow...
Bow Hothoof,"Go, Rainbow Dash! You sign that photo! Whoo!"
Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles,Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon!
Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles,The camera loves you! Yeah!
Bow Hothoof,"Now, let's do the pyramid! Scootaloo, get up there! You're the top!"
Spitfire,[to Rainbow] You really do got yourself your very own mega-fans. Lucky you.
Windy Whistles,You hung that towel!
Windy Whistles,Yeah!
Bow Hothoof,Greatest towel hanger of all time! [chanting] Towel!
Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles,[chanting] Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Tow<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"Stop! This is ridiculous! Mom and Dad, you are both too supportive! This is exactly why I didn't tell you I was a Wonderbolt! You're just... too much!"
Windy Whistles,Did... Did we do something wrong?
Rainbow Dash,"Yes! The fireworks, the cheerleading, and-and how do you even compare who is better or worse at hanging up a towel?!"
Bow Hothoof,We're just trying to be supportive.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I'm tired of it! I've had enough of you two being so proud of every little ridiculous, insignificant thing I do! [pants] I think you should leave."
Windy Whistles,"First of all, great job yelling at us, sweetie. No one [sniffs] can make their parents feel more worthless than you!"
Bow Hothoof,"[through tears] Your words were direct, clear, and... so painful! Is there nothing you can't do?!"
Scootaloo,Why?
Rainbow Dash,"Scootaloo, you don't understand!"
Scootaloo,"I met your parents hoping to learn more about you, but I don't like what I found out! I'll find somepony else to do my hero report on."
Rainbow Dash,"[panting] Scootaloo, wait! I know I wasn't myself back there, and I shouldn't have snapped at my parents! That's exactly why I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!"
Scootaloo,I don't understand. They're so proud of you.
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Can I tell you something?
Scootaloo,Sure.
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, but you might wanna hold onto your wings because this could rock you to your very core. Believe it or not, there was a time when I wasn't the best at everything."
Rainbow Dash,"See this picture? It looks like I won something awesome, but actually..."
Announcer,"And last, but not least, it's time to hand out our participant stickers!"
Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles,Yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh!
Bow Hothoof,Greatest participant ever!
Others,"Young ""Dumb-Bell"": Uh, your parents realize you didn't win, don't they?"
Rainbow Dash,"Granted, I was the youngest pony in the senior competitive circuit. Most other ponies my age were still in the Junior Flappers' Club. I thought it was utterly mortifying having my parents cheer me on even when I lost!"
Rainbow Dash,"[voiceover] But then, when I started to win competitions <U+0096> which didn't take very long, by the way <U+0096> things got even worse!"
Rainbow Dash,"[voiceover] Being the best came with consequences. Very loud, very embarrassing consequences."
Scootaloo,"Ya know, some ponies would dream of having parents like that."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, right! Name one!"
Scootaloo,"[sighs] Me. Growing up, I never thought I'd be the best at anything, because nopony ever told me. But your parents told you over and over again. Look! Best bath taker ever. Best carrot eater under three. Greatest napper of all time!"
Rainbow Dash,[scoffs] I am pretty good at napping. I can fall asleep anywhere. [snores] Huh?
Scootaloo,"For your entire life, your parents gave you the confidence to believe in yourself."
Rainbow Dash,"You're right. I was always so embarrassed by my parents that I didn't realize their support actually made me the awesome, confident, amazing, awesome, and awesome pony I am! [sighs] And I took them for granted."
Scootaloo,And you yelled at them.
Rainbow Dash,"[groans] I gotta make this right. I have an idea, but I'm gonna need your help. That is, if you're willing to help me after I acted like that."
Scootaloo,"Now, that's a great picture! ""Rainbow Dash learns the error of her ways""!"
Windy Whistles,"I'm telling you, I just can't see a thing. Scootaloo, you are just so great at blindfolds!"
Bow Hothoof,"It's true. You must tell me what kind of knot you used. Uh, falconer's knot? Wait, no! A farmer's loop!"
Windy Whistles,"What's this all about, anywho?"
Rainbow Dash,"[over loudspeaker] Windy Whistles and Bow Hothoof, please be seated for a super private Wonderbolt event! [clears throat] Mom and Dad, welcome to the... [quickly] ""I Love My Parents and I'm Sorry That I Took Them for Granted and I Know That They Made Me Who I Am Today So I Really Wanna Make It Up to Them""... [normally] event. Enjoy!"
Rainbow Dash,Thanks for doing this.
Spitfire,Happy to help.
Rainbow Dash,"Mom and Dad, I want you to know that I'm your biggest fan."
Windy Whistles,"Oh, honey, thank you. But you didn't have to do all this. It's kind of [whispers] embarrassing."
Bow Hothoof,"Eh, it is a bit much."
Scootaloo,And that's why Rainbow Dash is the most inspirational pony in my life!
Cheerilee,"Thank you, Scootaloo. Very well researched! But a little heavy on the pictures, and there was a moldy sandwich in your report. [chuckles] Um, I'll give you a B."
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! Greatest report giver of all time!
Others,"Bow Hothoof, Windy Whistles, [chanting] Scootaloo! Scootaloo! Scootaloo!"
Sweetie Belle,"Hey, Apple Bloom! Rarity's reorganizing her shop, and look what she found! Old costumes from the talent show!"
Scootaloo,We thought they'd come in handy in case we ever help a pony put on a play or need to make a quick escape disguised as clowns.
Apple Bloom,"Here ya go, Big Mac."
Scootaloo,"Whoa, that sure is a lot of apples!"
Apple Bloom,Are you makin' another delivery to Starlight's old village?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Sweetie Belle,"That's an awful long way for a pony to go, isn't it?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"You've been goin' there a lot lately. What is this, your fifth trip this week?"
Big McIntosh,[laughs nervously] Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"Okay, well, have fun. So what other costumes did you bring, Sweetie Belle?"
Scootaloo,Are you crazy?! We can't talk about costumes at a time like this!
Apple Bloom,Time like what?
Scootaloo,Your brother is hiding something. Did you see the way he was acting?
Sweetie Belle,Yeah. He totally blushed when you brought up how often he's been going to Starlight's old village.
Scootaloo,"Something is definitely going on. There can be only be one reason a pony would travel so far, so often."
Apple Bloom,...and he wants to get away from the smell!
Scootaloo,Maybe he's a spy on a mission to thwart an evil villain with a secret weapon: an apple cannon!
Apple Bloom,"No, that's crazy! I think it's my broccoli thing."
Sweetie Belle,Why don't we just ask him?
Scootaloo,"You saw how shifty he was acting earlier. There's no way he'll tell us what he's doing. Plus, I really wanna go undercover. We already have costumes! Call me ""Agent Rainbowhead""."
Sweetie Belle,"I'll be ""Shimmering Spectacles"", a librarian with a mysterious past."
Apple Bloom,And I'll be a pirate spy! Arrrgh! A spy-rate!
Apple Bloom,[gasps] Avast! Our ship be leavin' port!
Scootaloo,Huh?
Apple Bloom,"Big Mac's leavin'! If we're gonna be spies, we gotta go! Now!"
Apple Bloom,Big Mac's a-comin'! Quick! Act like apples!
Sweetie Belle,What? How?
Sweetie Belle,Who's that pony?
Scootaloo,Let me see! I dunno. Shouldn't have taken the binoculars. I don't know anypony here.
Apple Bloom,"That must be Sugar Belle. Applejack told me about her bakery. Obviously, she's just been orderin' a lot of apples."
Sweetie Belle,So nothing fishy's going on.
Scootaloo,No way! We came here to be spies! And no spy I know has ever solved a case that quick!
Sweetie Belle,"Mmm, how many spies do you know?"
Scootaloo,That's... not important. What's important is that we do more recon. Follow my lead!
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Mm.
Apple Bloom,Whoa. She sure likes her apples.
Sweetie Belle,What is she doing? Making the biggest apple pie in Equestria?
Sugar Belle,"Thanks for coming all this way, Big Mac."
Sugar Belle,It sure is nice seeing you again so soon.
Sugar Belle,"All I used to bake were boring old muffins, but thanks to your apple deliveries, I get to bake all kinds of delicious treats! Apple pies, apple fritters, apple turnovers, caramel apples, caramel apple cakes... [sighs] I just wish I had more room to display it all. My shelves only hold so much."
Apple Bloom,"I'm tellin' you, this pony reeeeaaally likes her apples."
Sweetie Belle,[gasps] Or Big Mac!
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,Huh?
Sweetie Belle,Just look!
Apple Bloom,"Sweetie Belle, I-I think you're right! [loudly] I think my brother has a crush!"
Sweetie Belle,Shh!
Apple Bloom,"Psst! Big Mac! [to the Crusaders] Now remember, my brother's super shy, so he's probably gonna be embarrassed about his crush. Just try and make him feel comfortable. Hey, Big Mac, it's me! Apple Bloom!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo,"We're here, too!"
Big McIntosh,Mm-hmm.
Apple Bloom,"I'm gonna ask you a very personal question, and I want you to answer honestly. Do you... have a crush on... Sugar Belle?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Scootaloo,"Well, that was easy."
Apple Bloom,This is so excitin'! My big brother has his very first crush!
Scootaloo,First crush? What about Cheerilee?
Sweetie Belle,"It doesn't really count when you trick a pony into drinking a love potion, does it?"
Big McIntosh,[angrily] Nnope!
Apple Bloom,[singsongy] My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! [normally] Wait! Does Sugar Belle even know you like her?
Big McIntosh,Uh-uh.
Apple Bloom,Then you gotta tell her!
Big McIntosh,O-Oh... eh... ehhhh...
Sweetie Belle,"We're pretty sure she likes you! I mean, she keeps ordering apples just so she can see you again."
Big McIntosh,Eeeyou think so?
Scootaloo,Totally! But you'll never know if you don't try.
Big McIntosh,Okay!
Scootaloo,"Go get her, Big Mac!"
Feather Bangs,"[California accent] Hey, girl. Heh-heh. I was writin' poetry by the pond when I saw these flowers. I thought I'd show them how pretty you are."
Sugar Belle,"Oh! Heh. Thanks, Feather Bangs."
Scootaloo,"Um, is it possible to have two crushes at once? Because it looks like Big Mac may not be the only pony Sugar Belle likes."
Apple Bloom,"Hey, Big Mac! Where ya goin'?"
Big McIntosh,Home!
Sweetie Belle,You can't let that Feather fella get in the way of your one true love!
Scootaloo,You've gotta take him down!
Apple Bloom,What can he do that you can't?
Big McIntosh,That!
Feather Bangs,Whoops! Heh-heh. These balls are like you. I'll always catch you if you fall.
Scootaloo,Seriously? That line worked?
Big McIntosh,She'll never pick me.
Apple Bloom,"Sure she will, 'cause we're gonna help you."
Big McIntosh,No love potions!
Apple Bloom,"Don't worry, Big Mac. We learned our lesson the hard way."
Scootaloo,Yeah. We're never gonna do that again.
Sweetie Belle,"Besides, I know exactly what to do! When I was younger, I read all the fairy tales."
Scootaloo,"When you were ""younger"", huh?"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, I was younger on the way here!"
Sweetie Belle,"It was a long ride! Anyway, as long as we do what the book says, you're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending. Uh, how about this one? ""Rescuing a damsel-pony-in-distress."" That's perfect! Of course, we'll have to improvise without a dragon."
Apple Bloom,Huh. Too bad Spike isn't here. Not that he's very threatening.
Scootaloo,So what should we do? Wait around for Sugar Belle to get herself into a scary situation?
Apple Bloom,Or... we bring the danger to her.
Apple Bloom,"All right. Scootaloo's gonna pretend to take Sugar Belle's things, then you swoop in and stop her. Ready?"
Big McIntosh,Nnope.
Sweetie Belle,"Come on! You're gonna be her hero! In fairy tales, the knight in shining armor always gets the girl."
Big McIntosh,Hmmm... Mm-hmm.
Sugar Belle,"Oh! Somepony, help!"
Feather Bangs,"Here's your sugar, Sugar. Though it is not as sweet... [chuckling] ...as you."
Sugar Belle,"[sighs] Thank you, Feather!"
Apple Bloom,That smooth-talkin' pony stole our rescue! And it totally would've worked!
Big McIntosh,[angry] Eeyup.
Sweetie Belle,"We're just gonna have to keep trying! Big Mac, are you ready to take it up a notch?"
Big McIntosh,"Oh, yup!"
Big McIntosh,"Oh, nope."
Sweetie Belle,"Trust us! There's nothing more romantic than waking your special pony from a sleeping spell with a magical kiss! See? ""They rode off into the sunset."""
Apple Bloom,Any sign of Feather Bangs?
Scootaloo,Negative! Coast is clear!
Apple Bloom,"It's now or never, Big Mac!"
Feather Bangs,"Oh-ho-ho, girl, you been workin' hard all day. Allow me to treat you like the princess... [chuckling] ...you are."
Sweetie Belle,Hey! That's our metaphorical sunset they're riding off into!
Scootaloo,"All right! This ends now! Feather Bangs may have good timing, and... a good mane... uh, but let's see him compete with a song!"
Big McIntosh,S-Say what now?
Apple Bloom,Of course! Why didn't we think of it before?
Sweetie Belle,"Every great love story hinges on the romantic musical number. Big Mac, you've gotta write a song for Sugar Belle!"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Apple Bloom,"Come on, Big Mac!"
Others,"""Swoon Song"": [Valley girl accent] Feather Bangs is soooo romantic."
Others,"""Fond Feather"": [Valley girl accent] When he speaks, I pretend he's talking to me."
Apple Bloom,Come on! You can do better than him! Just like we practiced!
Big McIntosh,We'll take a walk down by the river Watch the sunset from the field We'll plant the seeds of love together And water 'em right for a really good yield
Others,"Sugar Belle, sweet as pie You're the apple of my eye A cherry blossom in a field of rye And when the heifer's milked and fed And the pigs are in the sty Won't you be there by my side?"
Feather Bangs,"Oh, oh Oh, ah-oh"
Others,When you appeared before me My heart stopped beating Stars crossed the sky To come see what I was seeing
Others,"You were the one That made me believe I could fly Whoa, whoa, whoa"
Others,Birds could not sing A song that's as beautiful I'd do anything That's irrefutable
Others,"'Cause you are the sun Painting my heart in the sky (whoa-oh, oh)"
Others,"Sugar, Sugar Belle, whoa-oh When will you tell me that you feel the same? Like an angel on a candy cane Or the sunlight shining through a drain"
Big McIntosh,"Sugar Belle, when I look in your eyes [clears throat] I see the color blue And it reminds me of the sky above Uh, which is also... blue"
Feather Bangs,"Hey, hey, hey, yeah"
Others,Be my sugarplum I will be your watermelon Every time you smile I can feel my heart a-swellin'
Others,"Blood is rushing from my head to my hooves, yeah I start movin' when I'm feeling that groove, yeah"
Big McIntosh,"I've been writin' this song for you Searchin' for the perfect rhyme For the words I wanna say Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'... Be mine"
Feather Bangs,[Michael Jackson sounds] [autotuned] Every day I see you I know you could be the one for me Feel my heart a-beating like The rain upon a bumblebee
Others,"Don't you see that I could, uh-oh, uh-oh Whenever you are near me, I'm so... uh-oh"
Big McIntosh,Sugar Belle! Roses are red and violets are blue!
Feather Bangs,"Sugar, Sugar! My love is burning hot like a cheese fondue!"
Big McIntosh,Sugar Belle!
Feather Bangs,Sugar Belle!
Big McIntosh,Sugar Belle!
Feather Bangs,Sugar Belle!
Big McIntosh,Sugar Belle!
Feather Bangs,Sugar Belle!
Big McIntosh and Feather Bangs,Sugar Belle!
Sugar Belle,"What in Equestria has gotten into you two?! If you think I'm the kind of pony that likes all this nonsense, then you clearly don't know me at all! I wish everypony would just... leave me alone!"
Apple Bloom,"Big Mac? Oh, Big Mac?!"
Scootaloo,"Well, nopony's seen him."
Apple Bloom,"Aw, I feel terrible. I've never seen my brother so upset before. Oh, Big Mac?! Big Mac!"
Sweetie Belle,Are you okay?
Big McIntosh,Nnope.
Apple Bloom,Sorry it didn't work out with Sugar Belle.
Sweetie Belle,"We don't get it. Big, grand gestures always work in the fairy tales."
Big McIntosh,"But Sugar Belle's not a fairy tale princess. She's a real pony. She's kind, and she works hard, and she's sweeter than everything in her bakery."
Apple Bloom,That's it! We shoulda been thinking about what would mean a lot to Sugar Belle!
Big McIntosh,Hmmm... [gasps] I know just the thing! But I'm gonna need your help!
Apple Bloom,Really? Even after we messed it up?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup. Come on!
Sugar Belle,"Oh, okay. I'm... Wait a minute. You look familiar."
Scootaloo,"[fake voice] I shouldn't. Um, uh, I'm new in town. Mind showing me around?"
Sugar Belle,"Uh, sure. That's the whole town. It's just the one street."
Scootaloo,"[fake voice] Oh, no! Clumsy me! Here, let me help you clean it up!"
Sweetie Belle,I don't think Scootaloo can hold her off much longer.
Scootaloo,"[fake voice] Uh, n-now hold on a minute. Are you sure I can't buy you a new bag?"
Sugar Belle,I'm good. It's no big deal.
Sugar Belle,"Okay, what's going on?"
Scootaloo,[normal voice] Ahhh! The cupcake has landed! Repeat <U+0096> the cupcake has landed! Oof!
Sugar Belle,Big Mac! You made me a new display case?
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Sugar Belle,"And you made it bigger! You remembered! [gasps] Now I have twice as much room for all my desserts! [gasps] Which means... I can make even more! I've been dying to try baking cream pies and whoopie pies and icebox cakes and, of course, more apple treats! Oh, Big Mac, thank you so much. This is the sweetest thing anypony's ever done for me."
Big McIntosh,"[chuckles] Uh, y-y-yeah or-or nope or..."
Sugar Belle,"[giggles] I like you, too."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Awwwww!
Apple Bloom,That was the most romantic thing ever!
Sugar Belle,Wait a minute. I recognize you fillies. [to Big Mac] Have they been with you this whole time?
Big McIntosh,Ee<U+0097>
Apple Bloom,"I'm Big Mac's little sister, and these are my friends. We're sorry for everything we put you through today, Sugar Belle. Big Mac never would've gone through with all of those crazy..."
Sweetie Belle,...over-the-top...
Scootaloo,...downright ridiculous...
Apple Bloom,...attempts to impress you if we hadn't put him up to it. But we learned our lesson. Romance isn't about impressin' somepony. It's about doin' somethin' that means somethin' special to that pony you love<U+0097> Heh... [clears throat] like a lot.
Sweetie Belle,"Uh, Apple Bloom, I think they get it."
Feather Bangs,[singing] Sugar Be-eee-eee-elle...! [vocalizing] Yeah.
Scootaloo,"Sorry, Feather. You're a little too late."
Apple Bloom,Yeah! Sugar Belle's already picked her special somepony!
Sweetie Belle,But don't worry. You've got three not-so-secret admirers right behind you!
Feather Bangs,[nervous laugh] What should I say to them?
Apple Bloom,"Uh, you're askin' us for advice?"
Feather Bangs,"Uh-huh. Look, I-I can mane flip, write poetry, and juggle, but actually talkin' to a pony? Oh, it scares me almost as much as loneliness. Will you help me? Please?"
Apple Bloom,"Gee, I don't know about this."
Scootaloo,"He just needs a little nudge in the conversation department. Besides, I don't think Big Mac's ready to leave just yet."
Sweetie Belle,Let's do it!
Apple Bloom,"Feather Bangs, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are..."
Rarity,No. [chuckling] It's a call for submissions. Fashion contest I'm organizing. A showcase for aspiring young designers.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, wow! What an awesome idea!"
Rarity,Thank you. I remember how difficult it was to break into the fashion industry when I was starting out. That's why the winner of the contest will get to debut their line in the Carousel Boutique!
Spike,[dreamily] So selfless... So generous...
Rarity,I've also managed to get esteemed fashion critic Hoity Toity and iconic fashion photographer Photo Finish to come to Ponyville and judge the show. And... [squealing] Wait until you hear who else will be a judge.
Spike,Countess Coloratura?
Pinkie Pie,Sassy Saddles?
Spike,Spike?!
Rarity,No! [chuckling] The third judge for the Carousel Boutique's Couture du Future Fashion Contest is none other than... Applejack!
Applejack,What?!
Pinkie Pie,What?!
Spike,What?!
Rarity,...What?
Applejack,What?!
Rarity,"You already said that, darling."
Applejack,I know. But I had to say it again because that's how confused I am. You want me to judge a fashion show?
Pinkie Pie,"I'm sure Rarity has her reasons, and once we hear them, all of this will make sense."
Rarity,"I admit, Applejack is an unorthodox choice. But that is precisely what makes her an inspired choice!"
Pinkie Pie,See? Now it all... still doesn't make any sense.
Rarity,"Hoity Toity has expertise in fabric and stitchwork. Photo Finish has an artistic eye for shapes and colors. But sometimes, we designers forget about practicality. That's where you come in."
Applejack,"Uh, I think I might be a little too practical. My closet's nothin' but twenty versions of this hat."
Rarity,"Which tells me you're a pony who knows what she likes. Besides, a judge must be honest, and you're the most honest pony there is. Ask any pony <U+0096> they'll tell you."
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! Ooh! Lemme try! [to Cherry Fizzy] Excuse me. Have you ever heard of Applejack?
Cherry Fizzy,The most honest pony there is? Sure have!
Rarity,See? So what do you say?
Applejack,"Well, if I'm bein' honest, I don't think I'm the right pony for the job. Fashion just ain't my bag of oats."
Pinkie Pie,"Aw, booooo!"
Rarity,"I do understand your hesitation. But before you say no, sleep on it?"
Applejack,"Sure, I... guess I can do that for ya."
Applejack,"I mean, heh, can you imagine? Me, judgin' a fashion show?"
Apple Bloom,I'd do it! It sounds like fun gettin' to see all those pretty outfits!
Applejack,"Although... Rarity did say I just had to focus on practicality. She already has experts for the... uh, fashion-y stuff. Eh, but I still wouldn't know what to say."
Applejack,"Come on, Apple Bloom! You're doublin' our workload here!"
Apple Bloom,"Sorry. I wanted to wear a signature hat like yours, but it's makin' it harder to see."
Apple Bloom,"Wow! That is a lot better! Thanks, Applejack!"
Applejack,"Sure thing. You know what? I am gonna help Rarity judge her show! I think my sensible ""everypony"" take on fashion is exactly what the pony community needs!"
Applejack,"Rarity, I thought about it some more, and if you still need me, I'd love to be a judge."
Rarity,[squeals] I just knew you'd come around!
Photo Finish,"I, Photo Finish, have arrived!"
Hoity Toity,As has Hoity Toity.
Rarity,[gasps] It's wonderful to see you! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
Photo Finish,[simultaneously] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Rarity,Thank you both so much for doing this. Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
Hoity Toity,We missed you at Miss Pommel's debut in Manehattan last week.
Rarity,Miss Pommel is showing? I thought she was still making costumes.
Rarity,"Oh, my, they're absolutely stunning!"
Applejack,It sure is great to hear Miss Pommel is doin' so well.
Photo Finish,Who is this?! Who speaks?!
Rarity,"Oh, uh, this is Applejack. Another one of the judges."
Hoity Toity,"So, judge, what do you think?"
Applejack,"Oh. Wow. Uh, that is just... wow. These are clothes?"
Photo Finish,Ze photo is upside-down!
Applejack,This is... [scoffs] She looks like a disco ball! Hah! D-Did they have to roll her down the runway?! [laughing] I can't believe anypony would actually wear this! [laughing] Am I right?
Hoity Toity,"Oh, my!"
Photo Finish,I faint! Ugh...
Rarity,[nervous chuckling] So funny... Ahem.
Applejack,"Oh, gosh. I didn't mean to make her faint."
Rarity,"Oh, don't worry about it, darling. Uh, it happens all the time. Besides, that dress did look a bit like a disco ball. Although, Miss Pommel is making the point that, no matter what we wear, it is a costume of some kind or another."
Applejack,I have no idea what you're talkin' about.
Rarity,And... that's okay. Let's go meet the designers and help them get ready for the show!
Rarity,"Designers, welcome! Today you will work on your designs, and we judges will offer our guidance and advice as you prepare for tomorrow's big show."
Rarity,"Lily Lace, tell us about your inspiration."
Lily Lace,"[Valley girl accent] You guys, this morning, on my way here, I heard a bird singing literally the most beautiful song I'd ever heard! And I wanted to capture not so much the bird's song exactly but more like how the wind carried the bird's song!"
Hoity Toity,Powerful yet at the same time fragile and delicate.
Applejack,Uh... Huh?
Rarity,"Next up, meet Starstreak."
Starstreak,[panting] I'm not interested in what's already been done. Only what will exist... in the future!
Hoity Toity,Mmmm... Tomorrow's fashion belongs to those who hear it coming.
Inky Rose,I am Inky Rose.
Photo Finish,You have a very focused vision! A strong sense of what you want! It's gut!
Rarity,"Applejack, you've been rather quiet. What do you think?"
Applejack,Well... it's a lot of black. It's kinda... depressing.
Inky Rose,How's this?
Hoity Toity,Makes a world of difference!
Applejack,"Maybe to fashion experts like you. But to ponies like me, it's still black."
Applejack,And I'm not sure how you wear singin' birds or the future. [to Rarity] I don't think they liked what I had to say.
Rarity,"Ah, well, that's why you're here. Fashion needs a healthy dose of practicality now and then."
Applejack,Are you puttin' holes in the clothes?! On purpose?!
Inky Rose,It's to create a distressed look.
Applejack,"More like an old and tattered look! When a pony's old clothes get holes in 'em, they don't wanna go to the store to buy new clothes with holes in 'em!"
Rarity,"Okay, yes, not a very practical choice. Fashionable, but not practical."
Photo Finish,Simply shtunning!
Applejack,"Sure, it looks pretty, but that's a lot of fabric. With the way it drags behind, it'll be covered in dirt in no time. Thank goodness I'm here. Otherwise, we'd have had holes in clothes and dirty dresses."
Rarity,"But of course, no look is complete without mane and makeup!"
Applejack,"So, uh... when are you gonna do her mane?"
Starstreak,Ugh! It's already been done!
Rarity,"You know what? Uh, I think we've given the designers enough guidance for today. Let's, uh, let them finish their work."
Applejack,"Uh, can't wait to see what y'all do for the big show tomorrow!"
Lily Lace,I literally don't know why...
Starstreak,[simultaneously] I am so offended.
Inky Rose,[simultaneous grumbling] That was so insensitive...
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Applejack! On your way home? How'd the first day of the contest go?"
Applejack,"Heh! Great! At first, I didn't think I'd be much help. But thank goodness I signed on! Without me, they'd be doin' all kinds of crazy fashion-y things!"
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Rarity! Applejack says the contest is going great! Good thing she's there, huh?"
Rarity,"Yes, of course... Some of her thoughts are tough to swallow, but hopefully her candor will help the designers achieve the best designs possible."
Rarity,Sure... Hmm.
Rarity,[sighs] Much better.
Rarity,"[inhale, exhale] I can meet my goals. Today is a fresh start. Good morning, everypony! Time for final adjustments before the show!"
Hoity Toity,"If buttons could convey sadness, you've done it."
Applejack,"To me, they convey wakin' up an hour early just to button 'em all! And that's if you could reach most of 'em!"
Inky Rose,Is this better?
Applejack,"Heh. There you go! Now when it's cold, you just slide it on ya, and you're set. Like a poncho!"
Hoity Toity,Um... poncho?
Hoity Toity,Ohhhhh. You used hoof-cross-double-over stitches! [chuckles] They're perfect!
Applejack,Who cares if it's stitched perfectly? You don't need feathers on your head!
Photo Finish,Gasp!
Applejack,"My little sister tried to add some flair to her hat, and guess what it got her <U+0096> an extra hour of work pickin' apples off the ground!"
Photo Finish,"A good start, but it needs more. No. No. No. Yes!"
Hoity Toity,I'd go with this one.
Photo Finish,"No, this one!"
Photo Finish,Something is funny?
Applejack,"What? Oh, no. Uh, it's just, I mean... Those belts look the same."
Hoity Toity,"Well, that one completely changes the look. This one complements it."
Applejack,"You're kiddin', right?"
Rarity,Is everything okay?
Applejack,They're havin' a heated debate about those two belts.
Rarity,Ooh! Both good choices.
Applejack,No! There is no choice! They're the exact same belt! Ugh! This is so silly! Fashion is ridiculous!
Rarity,You don't mean that!
Applejack,"I do! I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion!"
Hoity Toity,Well! I never would've come if I knew we were going to be insulted!
Photo Finish,We go!
Rarity,No! Please! Come back!
Starstreak,"If they're out, I'm out, too. I didn't get into fashion to design boring utilitarian clothes!"
Inky Rose,Yeah... no.
Applejack,What? I was just bein' honest!
Rarity,Stop everything! There is no show! Take it all down!
Pinkie Pie,"Rarity, what's going on? Is everything okay?"
Rarity,No! It is the opposite of okay! The judges have quit! The designers have dropped out! The show is cancelled! All my good intentions squashed! [sobbing] And it's all Applejack's fault!
Applejack,Why are you mad at me?! I was just sayin' what I thought! And isn't that why you wanted me to be a judge?! For my honesty?!
Rarity,Of course! But you said fashion is ridiculous!
Applejack,But it's my opinion! And I'm not gonna lie!
Rarity,Oh<U+0097>! [scoffs] Come with me!
Strawberry Sunrise,"[chewing] Mmmm! [gulp] Oh! [chuckling] Rarity! Oh, what a nice surprise!"
Rarity,"Hello, Strawberry Sunrise. This is Applejack. I was wondering if you could tell her how you feel about apples."
Strawberry Sunrise,Don't like 'em.
Applejack,"What?! Why?! They're crunchy, they're sweet, they're delicious."
Applejack,You're right! Apples are better than strawberries!
Strawberry Sunrise,"Only if, by ""better"", you mean ""better at being disgusting""."
Applejack,[stammering] You'd better apologize!
Strawberry Sunrise,"Oh, I'm sorry... that you actually bite into those tasteless, mealyworm-filled things. Ohhh."
Rarity,"Applejack, why are you so angry? It's just Strawberry's honest opinion. What's wrong with that?"
Applejack,"Well, that's fine if she doesn't like 'em! But if she knew how hard we worked to make our apples perfect, maybe she wouldn't be so mean about<U+0097>! ...Ohhhhhhh... Oh, boy."
Rarity,"Mm-hmm. Doesn't feel so good, does it?"
Applejack,"Nope. No, it does not at all. [sighs] I am so sorry, Rarity. I got so carried away with bein' honest, I guess I didn't think about how I was makin' others feel. [sighs] I'm a real rotten apple."
Rarity,"I appreciate that, Applejack. That means a lot. I just wish you'd realized it before you ruined the fashion show."
Hoity Toity,I need to get some of these.
Photo Finish,It's the only way to travel.
Photo Finish,What are you doing?!
Hoity Toity,Canterlot is that way.
Applejack,Yup. But you're not goin' back to Canterlot yet.
Applejack,Hey!
Starstreak,I don't know.
Inky Rose,Run.
Lily Lace,I can't even!
Applejack,"Whew... Listen, y'all. I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things. But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful. So for that, I apologize."
Photo Finish,Zo! You don't think fashion is ridiculous?!
Applejack,"Uh... Well, I, uh... I still don't understand it. But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it. I also know this contest is important to Rarity. So what do you say?"
Hoity Toity,"Well, I'd hate to have come all this way here and not see what you can do."
Starstreak,"If they're judging, we're in."
Lily Lace,Under one condition. Literally.
Applejack,Anything.
Inky Rose,Untie us.
Applejack,"Show's back on, fellers!"
Applejack,[grunting] Ahhh...
Applejack,Aah!
Inky Rose,Uh-uh. Uh-huh.
Pinkie Pie,"...And then, Applejack found me and told me to distract you for an hour. But the hour's up! Ta-da!"
Rarity,B-B-But how?! They were all leaving. This was all coming down.
Lily Lace,You can thank Applejack. She literally did it all by herself.
Applejack,I don't think that word means what you think it means. But I did bust my tail because I know how much this means to you.
Rarity,"Ohhhhh! Thank you, Applejack."
Photo Finish,We start now!
Rarity,"First up, Lily Lace!"
Rarity,Starstreak!
Rarity,Inky Rose!
Rarity,"And now, it's time to vote. I am drawn to the beauty and drama of fashion, and nopony does drama better than Lily Lace, so I vote for her."
Hoity Toity,Simplicity is the keynote of true elegance. That is why I vote for Inky Rose.
Inky Rose,You've... made me so... happy?
Photo Finish,"Fashion is the art! I, Photo Finish, vote for Starstreak!"
Starstreak,"Wonderful to hear, darling."
Rarity,"Well, it all comes down to you, Applejack."
Pinkie Pie,"Can you believe it?! After everything that's happened, Applejack is the deciding vote! [screams] This is so exciting! Eeeeee!"
Rarity,"Well, Applejack?"
Applejack,[sucks air through teeth] Uh... Heh. U-Uh... Uh...
Rarity,"Lily Lace's clothes go here, Inky Rose's will go there, and Starstreak's there."
Applejack,"Sorry, but I couldn't pick just one. They all did great, and in my opinion, they all deserve to win."
Rarity,And I agree. I told you your perspective would be beneficial.
Applejack,"Is, uh, this one of your new designs, Rarity? It's, uh... Uh, the form is... reminiscent of, uh... I mean, it conjures up images of... uh... well, uh... I-I mean..."
Rarity,"Oh, that? No! I totally messed that one up! It's ghastly! Horrid! Absolutely terrible!"
Applejack,"Hah. Oh, thank goodness. 'Cause in my honest opinion... it's awful."
Rarity,Pffft!
Rarity,"When you're right, you're right!"
Applejack,I am relieved!
Starlight Glimmer,I know! I can't believe it either! The map has never called me before!
Spike,I'm sure that's not why she looks... like that.
Starlight Glimmer,"I also wasn't nervous before, but now..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry. For all we know, it's something small. Like maybe the cooks are fighting over who has the best butternut squash soup. Or the royal hairdressers are fighting over a comb."
Spike,"Or, you know, maybe the royal sisters aren't seeing eye-to-eye on something."
Twilight Sparkle,No! That's just crazy! Luna and Celestia would never fight. [beat] Again.
Princess Celestia,So the map sent you to solve a friendship problem?
Starlight Glimmer,"Yes, princess."
Princess Celestia,"Well, there's nothing wrong here. Right, sister?"
Princess Luna,"[sourly] No. Everything's perfect as usual, sister."
Twilight Sparkle,Psst! Pssst!
Starlight Glimmer,Twilight? Is that you? How are you here?
Twilight Sparkle,"[quickly] I'm not. I'm still home. It's an easy spell. I'll show you later. Anyway, enough about me. I had to check on you. Not in a meddling kind of way! In a friendly ""how's it going?"" kind of way. So, how's it going?"
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] Not great. I think the problem might be between Celestia and Luna.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, no, that's terrible! I mean, what makes you say that?"
Starlight Glimmer,You know how some ponies say nothing's wrong but you can tell something's definitely wrong?
Twilight Sparkle,[nervously] Noooooo... Heh.
Starlight Glimmer,"That's basically what the princesses did when I said there was a friendship problem. Only they did it more, you know, regally."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I wish I could help you, but I can't <U+0096> both for map reasons and because I have no idea! This is big! Like, really big! But I'm here if you ever need to talk. Or listen to music."
Twilight Sparkle,"Heh. Comforting, right?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Thank you so much for breakfast, princess. I can't believe you cook it yourself."
Princess Celestia,"Of course, Starlight! I really enjoy doing it. It's a small way to say I care."
Princess Celestia,"Good morning, sister! Join us?"
Princess Luna,[sourly] Too tired. [chomp] Please excuse me.
Starlight Glimmer,Wow. Last night must've been really hard on her.
Princess Celestia,[sighs] Perhaps. But she is like this every morning.
Starlight Glimmer,So I think Luna may be hurting her sister's feelings without even realizing it.
Twilight Sparkle,Poor Celestia. That's so sweet that she makes her sister pancakes every morning.
Starlight Glimmer,She's your mentor. I think you might be biased.
Twilight Sparkle,Fair enough. So what are you gonna do?
Starlight Glimmer,"Nothing, yet. I have to get all the facts. I asked Luna if I could spend some time with her this evening."
Guard,"Princess Luna's waiting for you, miss."
Twilight Sparkle,"Good luck, Starlight!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Wow, Princess Luna. You do this every night?"
Princess Luna,Lavender's calming scent is known to aid dreamers in achieving a restorative sleep.
Starlight Glimmer,[sniffs] That's so thoughtful!
Princess Luna,I try my best to make sure the ponies in this castle sleep peacefully.
Princess Celestia,"[laughs] Oh, you really are a card!"
Princess Luna,"[sighs] But as always, my sister is too busy having fun with dignitary ponies to acknowledge anything I do. Hmph!"
Starlight Glimmer,"So, both princesses are hurting each other without realizing it. And instead of talking about it, they're just getting colder and more distant."
Twilight Sparkle,And they're Celestia and Luna. So it's not like you can just confront them.
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, that's exactly what I was gonna do."
Twilight Sparkle,"What?! Are you crazy?! I mean, heh, you do whatever you think is best. This is your mission."
Starlight Glimmer,"[sarcastically] Gee, thanks for believing in me, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"I do. But the last time the princesses fought, Luna turned into Nightmare Moon, and Princess Celestia had to banish her for a thousand years! That can't happen again!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I can't do nothing. The princesses aren't the best at communicating with each other."
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Sorry. It's just, you said ""princesses"" and ""aren't the best"" in the same sentence, and it's making me nervous!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm not much help, am I?"
Starlight Glimmer,No!
Starlight Glimmer,Wow. I almost feel bad eating this. It's adorable.
Princess Celestia,"Like I said, I enjoy this part."
Princess Luna,"[sourly, mouth full] Hi."
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, Princess Luna! Wait! [deep breath] As you both know, the map sent me here for a reason, and I... think I found out what it is."
Princess Celestia,"Really? Oh, that is wonderful, Starlight! What is it?"
Starlight Glimmer,You two.
Princess Celestia,Excuse me?
Princess Luna,[simultaneous] I beg your pardon?
Starlight Glimmer,"I think you're accidentally hurting each other's feelings without realizing it. Princess Celestia, does it bother you that Luna never notices the wonderful breakfasts that you prepare for her?"
Princess Celestia,Uh... Y-Yes. It does.
Starlight Glimmer,"Princess Luna, tell Celestia how you feel about the fact that she never acknowledges the work you put into lining the hallway with lavender every night."
Princess Luna,"I... Well, I... I-It's not the best feeling. [to Celestia] I'm sorry I never noticed that you make fruit faces on pancakes, but nights are long for me. You might be a morning pony, but I am half-asleep."
Princess Celestia,"You think I don't get tired? I'm exhausted! Oh, I apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce. But by the time I get to retire for the night, I can barely see straight! Even so, I still make an effort to smile!"
Princess Luna,Like smiling is so hard.
Starlight Glimmer,I-I-I'm sure that's not what Princess Luna meant to say.
Princess Luna,Is that what exhausts you? Smiling and being adored by everypony?
Princess Celestia,"And you have it so much worse, do you?! You've spent your evenings flitting around giving ponies lovely dreams! Oh, it sounds just awful!"
Starlight Glimmer,"[chuckles] Okay! I feel like we should step back, take a deep breath..."
Princess Luna,Don't presume to know what it is like to govern the dream realm!
Princess Celestia,"And yet you know exactly what it's like to be me?! Oh, please!"
Starlight Glimmer,Enough!
Princess Celestia,[gasps] What have you done?!
Starlight Glimmer,I... went with my gut?
Princess Luna,Switch our cutie marks back this instant!
Starlight Glimmer,"My apologies, your majesties! But I can't, even if I wanted to. The spell lasts twenty-four hours. I-It may have been extreme, but, uh, I think it's still a good idea?"
Princess Celestia,[serious] What?
Starlight Glimmer,Y-You said it yourselves! Neither of you believes your sister knows how hard it is to be you. So this is your chance to prove it.
Princess Luna,"Well, I could use an easy day followed by a good night's sleep."
Princess Celestia,"You can try. I haven't had an easy day in, well, ever! But now, I get to sleep, and tonight will be a breeze. All right, Starlight Glimmer. We will do this."
Starlight Glimmer,I'm gonna stop talking now.
Twilight Sparkle,[hyperventilating] You switched their cutie marks?! The actual princesses' cutie marks?!
Starlight Glimmer,[groans] I thought we moved past this. It was the right call! I hope.
Guard,Are you okay in there?
Starlight Glimmer,"I-I'm good! Just, uh... reading an exciting book! [whispering to Twilight] He's gonna think I'm nuts!"
Twilight Sparkle,He's not the only one.
Princess Luna,"As you can see, Celestia and I are switching places today."
Princess Luna,"I assure you, I am more than capable of handling all of Celestia's, heh, duties. Dismissed."
Princess Luna,"So, what is first on my dear sister's to-do list?"
Starlight Glimmer,"It says you have a few public appearances. Store openings, judging the royal rose contest... You know, that sort of thing."
Princess Luna,"[chuckles] Oh, I knew today would be easy, but I didn't think it would be that easy."
Princess Luna,"""Princess Luna Unhappy with Student Fundraiser""? But I wasn't unhappy!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Um, you are scowling."
Princess Luna,"Well, I-I didn't mean to! I've been smiling all day! My cheeks hurt! I stopped for one second! And that's when he took the picture!"
Starlight Glimmer,Guess smiling all day isn't as easy as you thought?
Princess Luna,"It says here that, because of me, the school didn't raise enough funds to go on their field trip! I-I didn't mean for that to happen!"
Starlight Glimmer,"I know. But you can't dwell on that now. According to the list, some delegates are about to arrive for a luncheon. You need to dispel rumors of timberwolves in the White Tail Woods. The nearby towns have been in a state of panic for weeks."
Princess Luna,B-B-But I have to fix this!
Starlight Glimmer,You can't. You need to put on a brave face and help these ponies. It's what Celestia would do.
Princess Luna,"[deep breath, shouting] Hello! Great news! There are no timberwolves!"
Delegate Ponies,"No, there are definitely timberwolves!"
Princess Luna,"I'm sorry. But I couldn't stop thinking about those poor students. Normally, I have all the time in solitude I need to work through my problems at my own pace."
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, your sister doesn't get that luxury."
Mayor Cream Cheese,[muffled] The princess will definitely side with me!
Mayor Baltimare,"[simultaneous, muffled] Please see reason, Mayor Cream Cheese! I'm telling you, Baltimare..."
Starlight Glimmer,Ready for the town hall?
Mayor Baltimare,Glad that's settled.
Mayor Cream Cheese,[chuckles] And it only took three hours.
Mayor Baltimare,"That got heated, didn't it?"
Mayor Cream Cheese,Still on for golf?
Mayor Baltimare,"Oh, absolutely."
Starlight Glimmer,You made it to the end of the day. Yay?
Princess Celestia,"Oh, hello, Starlight. I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested. Where's Luna?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Um, uh, she already turned in for the night."
Princess Celestia,Did she now? It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected.
Princess Celestia,Moon raised! It's even easier than raising the sun. [chuckles] What's next?
Princess Celestia,"All right. Everypony's asleep. You're talking to yourself, Celestia. Heh. But there's nopony else to talk to! [chuckles] Yet. I can talk to ponies in their dreams!"
Princess Celestia,"Now, to save some ponies from their nightmares. Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right? Right. Good call, Celestia! And I'm talking to myself again."
Pancakes,[in Celestia's voice] I care. I care. I care. [distorted] I care.
Starlight Glimmer,[screaming] Ugh! No!
Twilight Sparkle,"This is big! Like, really big!"
Princess Celestia,Starlight! I'm here now. Tell me what's wrong.
Starlight Glimmer,"[panting] Going with my gut was the wrong call! I was supposed to bring you two closer together! But I've only driven you apart! If you two can't see why you need each other, then<U+0097>!"
Princess Celestia,"Don't worry, Starlight. I know how to handle Nightmare Moon."
Princess Celestia,This can't be!
Daybreaker,"If Luna can turn into Nightmare Moon, you can absolutely turn into me <U+0097> Daybreaker! The better, prettier, and more powerful version of you!"
Princess Celestia,No! I'll never turn into you!
Daybreaker,"Deep inside, you know how powerful you are. You don't need Luna."
Princess Celestia,"That's not true! Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!"
Daybreaker,"[laughs] Oh, please! You don't need anypony! You can do whatever you want. And all you have to do is get rid of anypony who stands in your way!"
Daybreaker,I never should've banished you to the moon! I should've destroyed you!
Starlight Glimmer,"No, you can't do that! Day, night, sun, moon <U+0097> Equestria needs both of you!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Without balance, there's no harmony!"
Daybreaker,Ugh!
Nightmare Moon,"You can't get rid of me so easily, sister! Unless you plan on smiling me to smithereens!"
Princess Celestia,Enough!
Daybreaker,[laughs] I told you I was more powerful than you!
Daybreaker,Ugh. So much black. We get it. You're sad. You could really use some... sun!
Starlight Glimmer,This is all my fault! I never should've gone on this mission! Now Equestria is doomed!
Dream Ponies,[singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...
Dream Pony,Why don't you want us to go on our field trip?
Princess Luna,[through teeth gaps] I don't...!
Princess Luna,"I mean, I do!"
Dream Ponies,[singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...
Princess Luna,Celestia! I'm so glad you're...!
Princess Luna,"[speaking normally] I've seen a lot, but I haven't seen this before."
Princess Celestia,It's Starlight Glimmer's. She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!
Starlight Glimmer,[sobbing] What was I thinking?! I'm never going with my gut again!
Princess Luna,"If you don't fix this soon, it could have a grave consequence on Starlight's psyche."
Princess Celestia,But my magic isn't powerful enough! I thought if we worked together...!
Princess Luna,"I have your magic, remember? It doesn't work in the dream realm. It has to be you!"
Princess Celestia,"Oh, Luna, I can't do this! I was wrong! Your job is so incredibly hard! You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness and do it all alone! It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!"
Princess Luna,"And that pony is you. I walked a day in your shoes. I thought all you had to do was smile and be adored all the time, but I was wrong. There is so much more to it than that."
Nightmare Moon,[screams] Ugh!
Starlight Glimmer,Don't do this to each other!
Princess Luna,"In order to defeat Daybreaker, you need only to trust in your strength as I do."
Daybreaker,You can't destroy me! I'm everything you want to be!
Princess Celestia,"No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist again!"
Princess Luna,You did it!
Princess Celestia,Only because you were here. I don't know how you do this alone.
Princess Luna,"So, um, did you talk to yourself?"
Princess Celestia,"Um, a little."
Starlight Glimmer,"Is this really happening, or is this still a dream?"
Princess Luna,"Welcome back, sister! I know you had a long night, so I made you some pancakes!"
Princess Celestia,"Oh! Heh. H-How... eh, nice. Ahem. [chews, gags, gulps] They're... delicious. Heh. Thank you."
Princess Luna,"[laughs] I know that face! They're not. I know you have to be perfect for everypony else, and you do an amazing job. But you don't have to do it for me."
Princess Celestia,"In that case, they are terrible!"
Princess Luna,I know!
Princess Celestia,"[sighs] But it means a lot that you tried. I love you, sister."
Princess Luna,I love you too.
Starlight Glimmer,"So... this was real. [yawns] Or... was it not real, and this just happened now and-and not in my dream? I'm so confused."
Princess Celestia,[laughing] It's all real. It was the right call going with your gut.
Princess Luna,"The map was wise to send you, Starlight. Nopony else would have been so bold as to do what you did."
Starlight Glimmer,That's a nice way of saying I came dangerously close to messing everything up.
Princess Celestia,It was just what we needed. The experience has made us closer than ever.
Starlight Glimmer,Wait. I'm not doing this.
Princess Celestia,I believe that one means your mission is complete.
Starlight Glimmer,Wow! I can't wait to tell Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,"[quickly] I already know! I mean, I don't know everything. I just got here to bring you your toothbrush! So this is just a friendly visit! Not interfering because I was worried! I wasn't! I knew you could do it, and I'm so, so, so, so, so proud of you! Tell me everything! Start from after I hyperventilated, and don't leave out any details!"
Princess Luna,"Oh, uh, by the way, there's a field trip you need to make happen and a <U+0096> ahem <U+0096> timberwolf issue you need to address."
Princess Celestia,W-What?
Princess Luna,Oh! Look! There's the sun! Time for me to turn in!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, wow! Oh, my gosh!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! Sorry, Applejack!"
Pinkie Pie,Twilight! Twilight! Where are you?!
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm in here, Pinkie! What is it?"
Pinkie Pie,You'll never guess what I just got!
Applejack,"Is everythin' okay? We heard a lot of ""oh-my-gosh""-in', and we weren't sure if it was a good thing or a bad thing."
Pinkie Pie,A good thing!
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""To pink pony who lives with baked goods."" It's from the yaks! [reading] ""Yaks cordially invite pink pony to Yickslurbertfest. Come. Now."""
Pinkie Pie,Prince Rutherford is officially inviting me to Yickslurbertfest in Yakyakistan!
Rarity,What is Yickslurbertfest?
Twilight Sparkle,It's a sacred yak holiday. How did you get Prince Rutherford to invite you?
Pinkie Pie,I subtly hinted for an invitation in my letters to him.
Pinkie Pie,[voiceover] May I please come to Yickslurbertfest? Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty please?!
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, we still don't know a lot about the yaks. So I think you should definitely go to Yickslurbertfest, Pinkie."
Fluttershy,Fostering friendships is what ponies do.
Pinkie Pie,I won't let you down! It's an honor to be the official friendship ambassador to the yaks!
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, that's not an official position."
Pinkie Pie,Yet. You're the princess of friendship. [singsongy] You can make it happen.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, you got it."
Pinkie Pie,Ahem? You have to make it official!
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Right. I hereby make Pinkie Pie the official friendship ambassador to the yaks!
Pinkie Pie,This is officially the most exciting day of my life!
Pinkie Pie,Yoo-hoo! Gummy! Pay attention! We're in the middle of an official friendship ambassador road trip game!
Pinkie Pie,That's better. Okay. I spy with my official friendship eye something that is blue!
Pinkie Pie,"[gasps] We're here! Oh, and by the way, the answer was sky. I win!"
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, I know. That was a hard one, Gummy. You're the best official friendship travel companion ever!"
Pinkie Pie,What is going on?
Prince Rutherford,Yaks destroy!
Yaks,Yaks destroy!
Pinkie Pie,Yikes!
Prince Rutherford,[laughs] Pink pony!
Pinkie Pie,"It's an honor to [grunts] be here, prince. Uh, did something terrible happen? Is Yickslurbertfest cancelled?!"
Prince Rutherford,"No! This Yickslurbertfest, where yaks come together to stomp."
Pinkie Pie,Ohhhhh. I didn't know that was part of the sacred holiday. So this angry display of destruction is part of the festivies. Huh. And here I thought you yaks were just in a bad mood.
Prince Rutherford,No. Stomping relaxes yaks. [grunting] Yaks' head never been so clear.
Prince Rutherford,Stop!
Prince Rutherford,"Pink pony better check self before wreck self. That is century-old sacred yak twig, passed down from generation to generation."
Pinkie Pie,"[gasps] Oh, no! I'm so sorry! I was just trying to get into the spirit of Yickslurbertfest. [distressed noises] Maybe I can fix it!"
Pinkie Pie,"Phew! Oh, you sure did, Prince Rutherford. [chuckles, to Gummy] That was a close one, Gummy! This trip has to be perfect! After all, we're not just visiting as friends. We're on official friendship ambassador business!"
Prince Rutherford,"Less talking, more stomping!"
Pinkie Pie,Stompie-stompie-stompie-stompie!
Prince Rutherford,"Now, I take pink pony on Yakyakistan tour."
Pinkie Pie,"Thanks, Prince Rutherford, but, heh, I've been to Yakyakistan before."
Prince Rutherford,Yak know. But thought pink pony might not recognize town since decorated for Yickslurbertfest.
Prince Rutherford,"Oh, yaks not just have eye for decorating. Yaks also amazing builders!"
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] No way! I thought you hired professional contractors!
Pinkie Pie,"Here. Uh, let me help you with that."
Prince Rutherford,"This ceremonial yak fire pit, where yaks tell stories."
Pinkie Pie,Oooh! I have so much to officially tell the ponies when I get back.
Prince Rutherford,This yak eating hut. Hut where yaks eat.
Pinkie Pie,"[slurp, chomp, gulp] Mmmm! The perfect balance of vanilla extract."
Prince Rutherford,Yak sleeping hut. Hut where yaks sleep.
Pinkie Pie,Huh!
Prince Rutherford,Yak music hut. Hut where yaks enjoy beautiful music.
Pinkie Pie,This is beautiful and<U+0097>!
Prince Rutherford,Shhh! Pink pony ruin with talking!
Prince Rutherford,...And that how yaks defeat evil and save world!
Pinkie Pie,"[claps, in deep voice] Pink pony like yak story!"
Prince Rutherford,Ho-ho! Yak impressed! Pink pony can almost be honorary yak.
Pinkie Pie,"[speaking normally] Official friendship ambassador and honorary yak?! [squeals] Pink pony's title card is full! [in deep voice] Horn bump! [speaking normally] Oh, wait! I don't have a horn! [gasps] Prince Rutherford, can I get some honorary yak horns?"
Prince Rutherford,No. Yak horn too heavy for small pony head.
Prince Rutherford,Yickslurbertfest stomp time!
Prince Rutherford,Stomp harder! Yaks extra happy! Ponies and yaks friends!
Pinkie Pie,Is this part of the festival?
Prince Rutherford,Pink pony ask too many questions.
Pinkie Pie,Everything is buried in snow! What are we gonna do?!
Prince Rutherford,Uhhh... Y-Yaks fine! Snow falls from mountain all the time!
Pinkie Pie,All the time?
Prince Rutherford,Every Yickslurbertfest.
Pinkie Pie,Okay. Avalanches like this completely bury all your homes every Yickslurbertfest? Really?
Prince Rutherford,"This is... big avalanche. But not a problem, for yaks are tough! Yaks dig through snow! Won't take long."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, good. You have an emergency plan in place."
Pinkie Pie,"Here, let me help!"
Pinkie Pie,Whew. I'm tired. We must be almost done. There's still snow everywhere?!
Prince Rutherford,Yaks keep digging!
Prince Rutherford,Yaks stop digging! Make situation worse!
Pinkie Pie,"Okay. Don't worry, Prince Rutherford. I'll go back to Ponyville and ask for help. Twilight and the others will be happy to come dig the snow away. After all, ""many hooves make light work."" Right, Gummy?"
Prince Rutherford,Yaks no need pony help!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh. Well, I'm sure it'll be okay, 'cause you probably have a Plan B."
Prince Rutherford,Yes. Yaks wait for snow to melt.
Pinkie Pie,All this snow?! It'll take a thousand moons before it melts!
Prince Rutherford,Yaks known for their patience.
Pinkie Pie,"Well... be that as it may, in the meantime, what will you eat? Where will you sleep?"
Prince Rutherford,"Dah! Yaks can make this work! Hardship make yaks the strong yaks that yaks are! If pink pony disagrees, then she can leave Yakyakistan and never return!"
Pinkie Pie,"[yelps] Uh, of course pink pony agrees with you! [nervous chuckle] Hey, let's try out some snow recipes! [grunting] Snow cakes! Snow spaghetti! Snow sandwiches! [nervous chuckle, chomp] Mmmm! Yaks can make this work!"
Prince Rutherford,[yawns] Yak tired. Yak retire to new sleeping hut.
Prince Rutherford,[gulps] Snow cake good!
Pinkie Pie,"[chomp, gulp, shiver] Mmmm! Just the right balance of cold and water!"
Prince Rutherford,Aah! Stop! Yak eating new eating hut!
Pinkie Pie,[whispering] Psst! Prince Rutherford. What are we doing?
Prince Rutherford,It's obvious. This new music hut.
Pinkie Pie,Oh. So we're swaying to<U+0097>
Prince Rutherford,Shhh! Pink pony ruin snow music with talking!
Yak Kid 1,What was yak?
Yak Kid 2,Yak stomach rumbles. Yak hungry.
Yak Kid 1,Shhh! Prince yak will hear yak!
Yak Kid 2,But snow worse than yak ever seen!
Yak Kid 1,"Yak know. Yak hungry, too."
Pinkie Pie,"[gasps] Gummy, did you hear that? They can't make it work!"
Prince Rutherford,Yaks stop swaying! Music over!
Pinkie Pie,"If Twilight and the others knew what was going on, they would be here to help in a pony's heartbeat. We have to convince Prince Rutherford that asking for help is okay. Will you help me, Gummy?"
Pinkie Pie,Thank you! And see? Asking you to help wasn't hard at all.
Pinkie Pie,"Pink pony has gathered you around the new ceremonial yak fire pit to tell you a story! A yak tradition, right?"
Pinkie Pie,"Yay! This is a story about a group of... uh, goats!"
Pinkie Pie,"[voiceover] Who lived in the desert. There was a sandstorm, and their entire village was buried in sand. There was nothing they could do. They knew they could not survive by only eating sand...wiches!"
Pinkie Pie,[giggles] Get it?
Pinkie Pie,...Okay. Anyway...
Pinkie Pie,"[voiceover] Finally, the goats' brave, wise leader <U+0096> let's just call him Prince... uh... Drutherford [giggles] <U+0096> decides that they couldn't do it by themselves. So he asked the neighboring town of, uh, Bovineville to come help them. [giggles] Yeah! Cows! The magical cows helped the goats, everyone survived, and lived happily ever after!"
Pinkie Pie,Because they asked for help. The end!
Pinkie Pie,So what is the moral of that story? Is it <U+0096> A <U+0096> asking for help is okay? B <U+0096> asking for help saves the day? Or <U+0096> C <U+0096> asking for help is good for everypony?
Prince Rutherford,D <U+0096> goats weak and horrible! Magic bovines need to stay out of goats' business!
Pinkie Pie,Um... [nervous chuckle] Not quite. Any yak wanna shout out another answer?
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, Prince Rutherford. I wanna talk to you about something. Uh, what are you doing?"
Prince Rutherford,"Uh, yak's snow bed got a little melty last night."
Pinkie Pie,"Okay, yeah. That's what I wanna talk to you about. You know, these yak snow beds are the fluffiest I've ever slept in. They're so comfortable, you forget that it's just a cold block of ice. And the yak snow sandwiches? Mm-mmm! I hate it when food burns your mouth or overwhelms it with flavor!"
Prince Rutherford,"Ah! Yak hates that, too!"
Pinkie Pie,"You know who would really, really enjoy these snow sandwiches? Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies! Oh, hey! I have an idea! Why don't I go to Ponyville and bring them back here?"
Prince Rutherford,Ponies like snow sandwich?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh! Ponies love snow sandwiches! And hey, while they're here, you can ask if they'll clear the snow away. Fun, right?"
Prince Rutherford,"When prince was little yak, prince stomped on ground too hard. Made deep hole and fell into hole. Ice froze over hole. Prince waved to friends and family from inside frozen hole. Waited for spring thaw. Prince survived on own."
Pinkie Pie,W-W-Wait a minute. You spent the whole winter in a hole?
Prince Rutherford,Yes. And yak never asked for help!
Pinkie Pie,"Okay. First of all, how did you make such a deep hole from stomping? And how did it freeze over so fast? And how could you see your family and friends to wave to them from inside a frozen hole? Even if all that was possible, how did you breathe in there?!"
Prince Rutherford,Yaks don't ask for help!
Pinkie Pie,But the yaks are hungry! And who knows when the snow will melt? I just don't understand why<U+0097>
Prince Rutherford,"Ah, yes. Is clear now that pink pony does not understand yaks. Honorary yak status rescinded! Bang! Pretend there is door! I just slammed it!"
Pinkie Pie,Fine! Be stubborn!
Pinkie Pie,"[groans] Those yaks are so stubborn! They refuse to ask for help, even though they need it! Well, this official friendship ambassador is gonna take matters into her own hooves! I'll show them!"
Pinkie Pie,"[sighs] You're right, Gummy. I am too worked up. Road trip game would officially calm me down. I know! Let's play Twenty Million Questions! You think of something, then I'll ask you twenty million questions until I can come up with what you're thinking of! Let's go! Is it blue? Is it green? Is it red? Is it greenish-red? Is it reddish-blue? Is it bigger than a bread box? Is it smaller than a bread box? Is it a bread box? Is it bread?"
Pinkie Pie,"...Is it teeth? Is it Granny Smith's dentures? Is it you? Is it a rooster? Is it a red rooster? Is it a red rooster eating corn? Ah! Used up all twenty million questions! Oh, well. We're here anyway."
Prince Rutherford,Official pony balloon still here? Pink pony gone because pink pony not tough like yaks! Horn bump in agreement! Now!
Prince Rutherford,"[chomp, chewing] Pleh! Snow sandwich lose novelty! Snow couscous for dinner!"
Pinkie Pie,"Then Prince Rutherford said, [imitating Prince Rutherford] ""Bang! Pretend there is door! I just slammed it!"""
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie Pie<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"So then pink pony said, [high-pitched] ""Fine! Be stubborn!"""
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, we have to help the yaks."
Pinkie Pie,"So in conclusion, we have to help the yaks!"
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm?
Applejack,"Just go with it, hon."
Twilight Sparkle,"Great idea, Pinkie. We'll be happy to help the yaks. This is what friendship is all about."
Applejack,Hey! I'll bring apples. This season's batch are extra juicy.
Rarity,And I shall provide the yaks with Equestria's finest textiles. They'll be silky and warm with hints of gold to complement their horns<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,Stop! We can't bring the yaks any pony stuff!
Fluttershy,Why not?
Pinkie Pie,"The yaks are very proud. They won't ask for help. You know what they say <U+0096> ""you can lead a yak to water, but you better not let him know you're doing it."""
Rainbow Dash,Nopony says that. Do they?
Twilight Sparkle,Okay then. This'll be an official covert friendship mission.
Others,"Applejack, Fluttershy, Mm-hmm!"
Rainbow Dash,You got it!
Pinkie Pie,Is it yellow? Is it slimy? Is it slimy yellow?
Rainbow Dash,We're not playing that!
Pinkie Pie,These walls are high. Sneaking in will not be easy.
Rainbow Dash,Or it's super-easy 'cause I'm awesome.
Pinkie Pie,Go ahead! I'll catch up! You all know what to do!
Prince Rutherford,"[yawns, gasps] What happened?!"
Yak,Snow melted! Prince Rutherford was right!
Prince Rutherford,[laughs] Yaks tough! Yaks wait patiently! Yaks win!
Applejack,Hoo-wee! Helpin' to fix an entire yak village sure takes a lot outta ya.
Twilight Sparkle,Let's get out of here before<U+0097>
Prince Rutherford,"Oh, pink pony!"
Pinkie Pie,"[nervous gasping] Just play it cool! [to Prince Rutherford] We didn't help fix Yakyakistan! [nervous chuckle] No, no! We're just here for the snow sandwiches! But then we got here, and the snow was gone, so we thought we'd hit a diner on our way back to Ponyville! Bye-bye!"
Prince Rutherford,Wait. Yak not mad at pink pony.
Pinkie Pie,Yak not?
Prince Rutherford,Pink pony help yaks without yaks asking. Means pink pony understand yaks.
Pinkie Pie,I do? Huh! I do!
Prince Rutherford,Pink pony the best kind of friend. Officially honorary yak!
Pinkie Pie,Yippee! My own honorary yak horns! Now I can officially horn-bump! Whoa!
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah... You know, this is a little heavy for my small pony head."
Applejack,"[chuckles] Need some help with that, Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Pie,"[deep voice] Pink pony no need apple pony's help! [giggling and snorting, normally] Just kidding! Pink pony got apple pony good!"
Pinkie Pie,"Seriously, this is heavy."
Fluttershy,Care for a carrot-ginger sandwich?
Discord,Oh! You remembered to cut off the crusts for me.
Fluttershy,Of course I did. I know how you like them.
Discord,You really do make the best finger foods.
Discord,What do you say?
Discord's finger,Discord' [high-pitched] Excuse me.
Discord,[scoffs] I really can't take them anywhere.
Discord,Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?
Fluttershy,"Oh, no. I'm so sorry, but I seem to be out."
Discord,"Well, I can just pop us in some more."
Fluttershy,"Oh, that's all right. I need to go to the market anyway. I have to restock my pantry for our tea party next week."
Discord,Oh. I never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties.
Fluttershy,"Oh, it's really not that much."
Discord,"No, no, no, no, no! I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long. It's high time I do something about it. What to do, what to do..."
Discord 2,Why don't you host the next tea party?
Discord,I've got it! Why don't I host the next tea party at my place?
Discord 2,"Hey, that's my idea."
Discord 2,Why didn't I see that coming?
Fluttershy,Are you sure? I wouldn't want you to go through any trouble.
Fluttershy,Then count me in. I'm already looking forward to it.
Discord,"Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?"
Fluttershy,"Sounds good to me. You know, Discord, I've never been to your house before."
Discord,"Well, that's okay, because I've never hosted a tea party before."
Discord,"Oh! I've never hosted a tea party before! So much to do! [sips tea] Thank you so much for the tea and nibblies, but I really must be going!"
Fluttershy,"Uh, Discord? Before you go, would you mind helping me tidy up?"
Discord,"There you go. Back to normal, just the way you like it. See you tomorrow!"
Discord,I can't wait!
Discord,"Okay. Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?"
Pearly Stitch,"I'm sorry, dearie. Were you talking to me?"
Discord,"Actually, madam, I'm talking to myself."
Discord 2,"Well, I'm not talking to you!"
Discord,It's for Fluttershy!
Discord 2,"Oh, all right. No more holes, though. [snaps fingers] You have to knock this tea party out of the park for her. She was our first friend, after all."
Discord,You don't have to tell me that. She gave us a chance when no other pony would.
Discord 2,She makes us want to be a better draconequus. Fluttershy deserves the best of everything.
Discord,Of course! I should get her the best of everything. Why didn't I think of that? ...Well? Are you going to answer me or not?
Pearly Stitch,"Me? Uh, I thought you were talking to..."
Discord,Excuse me. Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?
Others,"""Jasmine Leaf"": Why, yes, it is."
Discord,"Oh, wonderful! I'll be enjoying her company tomorrow, so I will be needing your very best tea, please. Something especially special."
Others,"""Jasmine Leaf"": I'm sure Fluttershy would enjoy some of our rose hip green tea."
Discord,"[chuckling] Oh, interesting. Does it decorate your hips in roses or turn you green?"
Others,"""Jasmine Leaf"": Uh... neither? It just tastes good."
Discord,How boring. Pass. Hold on! Ginseng tea! Now that sounds promising. What does it sing? I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.
Others,"""Jasmine Leaf"": Again, it's just tasty like all of our tea here."
Discord,So... all of this is just tea you simply drink?
Others,"""Jasmine Leaf"": Uh-huh."
Discord,[laughs] Singing ginseng! I'll take it!
Others,"""Jasmine Leaf"": Are you sure you're friends with Fluttershy? You seem so very different from her."
Discord,"Well, of course we're friends! She gets me, and you obviously do not! [imitating ""Jasmine Leaf""] ""Are you sure you're friends with Fluttershy?"" [scoffs] The very nerve!"
Discord,I'm sorry. Do you validate?
Discord,Hello!
Others,"""Raspberry Vinaigrette"": [yelps] Uh, can I help you find something?"
Discord,"Yes, you can. Your finest tea set, please. I want only the best for my friend Fluttershy."
Others,"""Raspberry Vinaigrette"": Uh... you're friends with Fluttershy?"
Discord,"Yes... judgy... clerk... pony! Why is it such a surprise? Sure, she's on the quieter side, and I'm a bit, well, more showy. But I'll have you know we're besties. And that's why I need the [echoing] best tea set!"
Others,"""Raspberry Vinaigrette"": Uh, perhaps then you'd be interested in our classic tea-for-two set."
Discord,A teapot that just pours tea? How positively dreadful!
Others,"""Raspberry Vinaigrette"": But that's all teapots are supposed to do."
Discord,"Now, let's see. I have the perfect tea and the perfect tea service. What else do I need for the perfect tea party? Oh! Decorations, of course!"
Discord,"[chuckles] Better. Oh! I'll need napkins. I'll simply make them... ah, well, I could... or... No. I've got nothing. How do I make these better? What should I do? Make them... [gasps, snaps fingers] Make them glow! Oh, that's not good enough for Fluttershy. Should I make them fly? Glow, fly, and [chuckles] and fold! Glow, fly, fold into fun shapes, perhaps?"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, Discord? Are you okay?"
Discord,"Pinkie Pie! Just the pony I need. [snaps fingers] As the party pony and Fluttershy's close <U+0096> but not best <U+0096> friend, I need your advice. I'm hosting a tea party for her, and it has to be perfect. No! It has to be even better than perfect!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Discord. You're waaaaaay overthinking things. All you have to do is make Fluttershy feel comfortable. It should be pretty easy for you. You know her so well!"
Discord,"And that's why you're the party expert. Thank you, Pinkie Pie. I feel so much better now."
Pinkie Pie,"Eh, it's what I do."
Pinkie Pie,"[to Cherry Fizzy] Excuse me! Where can I find the glowing, flying, self-folding napkins?"
Discord,"Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable... Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem."
Discord,"Oh, dear. That might be a problem."
Discord,Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Maybe Fluttershy would be comfortable having a tea party here.
Discord,Maybe I just need another set of eyes on this. What do you think?
Discord,That bad?
Discord 2,"No, worse! Fluttershy would never be comfortable here! What have you done?!"
Discord 2,Relax! We can fix this. Time to call in the team.
Discord 2,"Okay, chief. What's the plan?"
Discord,"What to do, what to do, what to do... Oh!"
Discord,"Got it! We know Fluttershy, and we know what she likes. First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff."
Discord 2,You heard him! Strike the new stuff!
Pi<f1>ata,Bleh!
Discord 3,Pi<f1>atas hate bats.
Discord,Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria!
Discord,"Well done, everybody, but there's still more work to do."
Discord,"We need to make this place more Fluttershy and less, well, me."
Discord,And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...
Discord,...that lead somewhere.
Discord,Phew!
Discord 2,"How boring. I mean, normal."
Discord,Thank you!
Discord 2,Good job. The window treatments are perfectly unexceptional.
Discord,But we're not done yet.
Discord 2,You don't mean...
Discord,Mm-hmm.
All Discords,Makeover!
Discord 2,Hating it. Hating it. Hating it. Hating... how much I love it!
Discord,"Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl. [clears throat, reading] ""It is very nice to see you today."" ""Have you read any good books lately?"" ""Your garden looks positively lovely."""
Discord,"Huh. Quite strange. For the first time in my life, I don't feel quite strange. In fact, I feel... completely normal. Everything is finally perfect for Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,Discord! I'm so excited to finally see where you live!
Discord,"G-Greetings, friend. Please do come in."
Fluttershy,I can't wait to see how... uh... Oh.
Discord,Is something amiss?
Fluttershy,"Um, no, no, not at all. It's just not what I expected. It's quite... lovely."
Discord,Please have a seat.
Fluttershy,Where is it?
Discord,Right here.
Fluttershy,Oh.
Discord,I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today.
Fluttershy,"Oooh! Does it actually turn us green? Is it really envious of the other teas? What's it do, what's it do?!"
Discord,"Uh, well, it tastes delicious."
Fluttershy,Oh... Okay.
Discord,What particularly nice weather we're having.
Fluttershy,"Yes... Yes, we are."
Discord,"[sips tea] It did rain the other day, however."
Fluttershy,Uh-huh...
Discord,But the weather today is particularly nice. ...As I previously mentioned. Would you care for some milk toast?
Fluttershy,"Uh, Discord, you don't seem to be yourself today. Are you feeling all right?"
Discord,Whatever do you mean?
Fluttershy,"Well, it's just... what you're wearing. And also what you're saying. And also the way you're saying it. And, um, pretty much everything else."
Discord,"Oh, dear Fluttershy, worry not. I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal. Now, let me top you off."
Discord,Oops! Butterfingers! How embarrassing.
Fluttershy,"Uh, what's going on?"
Discord,I have... no idea.
Fluttershy,[gasps] Discord! You're starting to fade away!
Discord,Huh. Have you tried the scones? They're positively delectable. The secret is in the extra butter.
Fluttershy,"What is wrong with you?! You're acting so normal, which is not so normal for you!"
Discord,"Well, whatever do you mean? This is just me being me."
Fluttershy,"No, it's not! It's you being like everypony else!"
Fluttershy,"Eeeek! The more you do it, the more you fade away! Of course! You're a creature of pure chaos! Being normal is destroying you!"
Discord,[laughs] How interesting. That reminds me of something I heard at the market today.
Fluttershy,"Stop it! Please! You need to go back to being your not-normal normal self! Quick, Discord! Uh, do something chaotic before it's too late! Please!"
Discord,Do something chaotic? I'll try...
Discord,"Ohhhh, that's not good..."
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! I tipped over that cup! That's pretty chaotic, right?"
Fluttershy,"[whimpers] What if I... [chomping, mouth full] Oh, my! Talking with food in my mouth after taking a bite from every sandwich! [gulps] How wacky! Doing anything for ya?"
Fluttershy,"[whimpers] Okay. Hmm. Maybe I need to start thinking like you. Ohhh... What would Discord do? Well, I guess he'd probably make another version of himself to bounce ideas off of."
Fluttershy,But one wouldn't be enough. He'd need more! Way more!
Fluttershy,"[to her reflections] Hey there, Fluttershys! Any ideas on how to Discord up this tea party? [higher-pitched] Hi, Fluttershy! Thanks for asking! First of all, you gotta redecorate this place. I mean, this is where Discord lives! And you're telling me there aren't any stairs that lead to nowhere? [speaking normally] On it!"
Fluttershy,"Better... but it still needs something. Now, that's more like it!"
Fluttershy,"[gasps] It's working! Okay, what else? Furniture on the ground? So predictable! Let's put them where they don't belong!"
Fluttershy,And he'd have a chaise lounge that would actually chase you! Because he's funny like that! Bet you can't catch me!
Fluttershy,Oh! And Discord would have a special kind of tea! Like a ginseng that could really sing!
Fluttershy,"And he'd serve it on a floating table! We never talked about it, but I'm pretty sure Discord hates gravity!"
Fluttershy,[laughs] Now this is exactly what I was hoping for!
Discord,This is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.
Fluttershy,I wouldn't expect you to throw a tea party the way I would. We're different!
Discord,"I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore."
Fluttershy,What?! Why would you ever think that?
Discord,Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else.
Fluttershy,"That may be true, but we make sense to me. I never would've thought to make singing ginseng before I met you. But you've opened me up to so many more possibilities and impossibilities. So I guess what I'm trying to say is I like you because you're so different from me."
Discord,You do?
Fluttershy,"Of course I do, silly! Besides, what's discord without a little chaos?"
Discord,"[chuckling] Well! In that case, I certainly don't need to be wearing this."
Discord,Oops! [laughs] I forgot that I still had this on!
Fluttershy,"[giggling] Now, about that tea party..."
Fluttershy,"You know, your garden really is looking lovely."
Discord,"Why, thank you for noticing. I also couldn't help but notice that you need a refill."
Fluttershy,Gesundheit.
Discord,It really is nice having you here.
Fluttershy,I'm happy to be here. And I really do like your place. Because it's so you.
Discord,"Why, thank you, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,"Now, how about we try some of those delicious-looking sandwiches?"
Discord,[chuckles] You read my mind!
Apple Bloom,Hmmm.
Apple Bloom,[gasps] Thank you! You must be new. I'm Apple Bloom.
Grand Pear,I'm Grand Pear.
Apple Bloom,Welcome to Ponyville!
Goldengrape,[scoffs] You mean welcome back to Ponyville. Grand Pear was originally from here before he opened his famous pear jam store in Vanhoover.
Apple Bloom,Really? Why'd ya move back?
Grand Pear,"I, uh... [smacks lips] Well, I needed a change of pace."
Apple Bloom,Huh. [chomps] This is delicious! [chomps] I can't believe I've gone my whole life without ever havin' this.
Grand Pear,Glad you like it.
Apple Bloom,How much?
Grand Pear,Nah.
Apple Bloom,"Wow! Thanks, Mr. Grand Pear, sir! It was real nice meetin' you!"
Applejack,"Glad you're back, sugarcube. Just in time for breakfast for dinner."
Apple Bloom,I got the perfect topper for flapjacks at the market today.
Applejack,[gasps] Pear jam?! What were you thinkin'?!
Applejack,Quick! Hide it!
Apple Bloom,Huh?
Apple Bloom,What's the big deal? It's just pear jam.
Applejack,The big deal is that there is a long-standing feud between the Apples and the Pears!
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Apple Bloom,Why?
Applejack,"Why?! ...Well, uh, a-actually, I-I'm-I'm not really sure. You have any idea, Big Mac?"
Big McIntosh,Uhhh... nope.
Apple Bloom,Then I guess we should ask Granny?
Granny Smith,Ask me what?
Applejack,"Uh, what goes better with apple fritter flapjacks <U+0096> caramel syrup or praline!"
Granny Smith,[blows raspberry] Praline.
Granny Smith,"[sniffs] Oh-ho-ho, that smells great, Applejack. I'ma go wash up for supper. Be right back."
Applejack,"Listen, sugarcube. Anytime Big Mac and I ever asked Granny about the feud or the Pears, she'd get so upset she couldn't talk. Best not bring it up."
Apple Bloom,"O-Okay, but that Grand Pear was really nice to me, even though I'm an Apple. I wonder what happened."
Applejack,"Me, too. But if we can't ask Granny, I don't know who<U+0097> We can ask Goldie Delicious! If anypony knows about the feud, it's the family historian!"
Apple Bloom,"I'm in! What do you say, Big Mac? Siblin' trip first thing tomorrow?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Goldie Delicious,"Now, that's how you make an entrance! Or is it an exit? [laughs] Well, anyway, it's so wonderful to see you three. To what do I owe the pleasure?"
Applejack,"Well, Goldie, we were hopin' you could tell us about the, uh... feud with the Apples and the Pears."
Goldie Delicious,"Oh. Oh, dear. Well, does Granny Smith know you're here?"
Apple Bloom,"No, ma'am. But I ran into Grand Pear yesterday, and he was real nice. Maybe the feud was a misunderstandin' or somethin', and we can fix it?"
Goldie Delicious,"Oh, well, I don't know about that, little one. But if it's a story you're after, I suppose you have a right to know. Now, let's see, I got a stack of books here someplace... Oh! Apple Family History, Volume 137! Hmm, hmm... Here we are. ""Feud with the Bears"". I mean, ""Pears"". My eyes ain't what they used to be. A long time ago, Sweet Apple Acres wasn't the only farm in Ponyville. In fact, there was another one just right next door."
Young Granny Smith,Come and get your apples! Nothin' sweeter than bitin' into a crisp apple on a beautiful fall day!
Young Grand Pear,"Unless, of course..."
Young Grand Pear,...you could bite into a juicy pear.
Young Granny Smith,[scoffs] Please. Pears are just what happens when you ain't no good at farmin' apples.
Goldie Delicious,[voiceover] And so it went. Granny and Grand Pear were always at each other on who was the best farmer or who took better care of their trees. If Granny read to her trees at night...
Young Granny Smith,"[reading] ""And then, the little tree reached his branches up to the moon, and the moon said, 'Good night.'"""
Goldie Delicious,"[voiceover] ...why, then Grand Pear had special blankets made for his trees so they wouldn't get cold."
Young Grand Pear,"Good night, trees. [kisses] I've got you covered. Mm-hmm."
Goldie Delicious,"[voiceover] In fact, all the Apples and the Pears were rivals to the core! The only Apple and Pear who ever got along were Bright McIntosh and Pear Butter."
Young Bright McIntosh,[whispering] Pssst! I'm not supposed to talk to you.
Young Pear Butter,[whispering] I'm not supposed to talk to you either.
Young Bright McIntosh,"[whispering] My mom says if you hold a buttercup under your chin, it'll make your chin glow. But it doesn't work on me. See?"
Young Pear Butter,[whispering] Does it work on me?
Young Bright McIntosh,"It sure does, Buttercup."
Young Pear Butter,Buttercup. I like that name.
Applejack,[voiceover] Wait an apple-pickin' minute!
Applejack,Bright Mac and Buttercup? Those are our parents' names!
Goldie Delicious,"Of course Buttercup was just a nickname your father gave your mother. Pear Butter <U+0096> well, that was her given name."
Applejack,Are you sayin' our mother was a... Pear?!
Big McIntosh,So we are half-Pear?!
Applejack,I can't believe it! How did we not know?!
Goldie Delicious,"Well, uh, nopony called your mother Pear Butter."
Goldie Delicious,"And her cutie mark was a preserve jar, but pear butter don't look too much different from apple butter, so no clues there."
Applejack,[sighs] Is there a-anythin' else you can tell us about them?
Apple Bloom,Anything else?
Goldie Delicious,Hmm... I'd need Volume 138 for that.
Goldie Delicious,"I'm sure I could wrangle it... in a, in a couple of days."
Applejack,"[sighs] That's all right, Goldie. It was... nice just to hear<U+0097>"
Goldie Delicious,Ooh-hoo-hoo! I just remembered somethin'! Your dad and his buddy Burnt Oak would get in all kinds of trouble together as colts.
Applejack,Burnt Oak? The firewood salespony? I haven't seen him in ages.
Goldie Delicious,He and your dad were thick as thieves back in the day. Y'all should talk to him.
Burnt Oak,"Well, well, if it isn't the Apples. What can I do for ya? I know you're not here for firewood. You got more trees than anypony in Ponyville."
Applejack,You're right. We're not here for that.
Burnt Oak,Come to ask about your dad?
Big McIntosh,"Uh, eeyup."
Burnt Oak,"I wondered if you might. Hoped you would. It's nice to talk about him. [laughs] We had a lot of laughs. In fact, this one time..."
Burnt Oak,"[voiceover] ...we were racin' to see who could till the fastest, and Bright Mac was leavin' me in the dust. He would've won, too, if he wasn't so... distracted."
Bright Mac,Whoa!
Grand Pear,Oh!
Grand Pear,"Pear Butter, what did you do?!"
Pear Butter,I-I'm not sure.
Bright Mac,"She didn't do it, sir."
Grand Pear,Excuse me?
Bright Mac,The water silo. It was my fault.
Grand Pear,"[snorts] You owe me a new silo, boy! [to Pear Butter] And you, come with me. No daughter of mine is gonna make goo-goo eyes at an Apple!"
Burnt Oak,Grand Pear never would've known it was your father's fault. But there was no way he'd let your mother take the blame for somethin' he did.
Apple Bloom,"So Dad was super honest! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh, Applejack?"
Burnt Oak,Your dad worked the Apple farm all day and then headed over to the Pears on his breaks to fix the water silo. I didn't see him for weeks! Not that he minded. Gave him a chance to get to know your mom.
Apple Bloom,"Did you know our mom, too?"
Burnt Oak,"Buttercup was a real peach of a Pear. But if you want to know more about her, you should ask Mrs. Cake."
Apple Bloom,Mrs. Cake?
Burnt Oak,She and your mom were inseparable when they were fillies.
Applejack,"Then let's go! Thanks, Burnt Oak!"
Big McIntosh,"Uh, would it be okay if we stopped by again sometime to hear more stories?"
Burnt Oak,I'd like that very much.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Well, cinnamon sugar on toast! All three Apple siblings!"
Applejack,"Hi, Mrs. Cake. We heard you and our ma used to be real good friends, and we were hopin' you could tell us a bit about her."
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, I would love to. I never knew the right time to bring it up. But I'm so glad you came! [laughs] Uh, for starters, did you all know that it was your mom who convinced me to pursue baking?"
Apple Bloom,But isn't your name Mrs. Cake?
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Not always. Back when I was Chiffon Swirl, heh, I had no idea what I was supposed to do. But one day, your mom brought me some candied pears, eggs, flour, sugar, and vanilla, and told me to just be creative! Next thing I knew, I was whipping up pear upside-down cake, and I got my cutie mark! It was like she knew what I was supposed to do long before I did."
Applejack,"[to Apple Bloom] Just like you, sugarcube! Or rather, you're just like her!"
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. That was the first of many cakes for me, and Buttercup was with me through it all."
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. [voiceover] She'd be my taste-tester, help with the decorating, and prep new ingredients. Over the years, I perfected my recipes. Your mom did so much for me. One day, I wanted to surprise her with a cake."
Bright Mac,[sniffs] Achoo!
Pear Butter,[gasps] Oh. It's just you.
Chiffon Swirl,Sorry. I just brought you a little something to say thank you. But I see you're busy. Hah.
Pear Butter,[giggles] Promise you won't say anything?
Chiffon Swirl,"You and Bright Mac? Whew, I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. Your families hate each other."
Pear Butter,I can't help it. We just sorta... happened.
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. [voiceover] Then Pear Butter told me the sweetest love story I have ever heard.
Bright Mac,"Happy one hundred and thirty-one thousand, four hundred and fifty-six hour anniversary, darlin'."
Pear Butter,What? [laughs] That's way longer than we've been together.
Bright Mac,"I know, but it's the anniversary of the first time I called you ""Buttercup"". It's okay if you didn't get me anythin'."
Pear Butter,Actually... I did.
Bright Mac,A guitar? For me? But... [strums guitar] I don't know how to play.
Pear Butter,"Quiet, you."
Pear Butter,We're far apart in every way But you're the best part of my day And sure as I breathe the air I know we are the perfect pair
Others,On a prickly path that goes on for miles But it's worth it just to see you smile
Others,And I cannot be pulled apart From the hold you have on my heart And even if the world tells us it's wrong You're in my head like a catchy song
Bright Mac,Wow. It's just... wow.
Pear Butter,Do you like it? Be honest now.
Bright Mac,It's the best gift you could've given me!
Pear Butter,"The seasons change and leaves may fall But I'll be with you through them all And rain or shine, you'll always be mine"
Others,On a prickly path that goes on for miles You're the only one who makes it all worthwhile
Others,"And you should not blame me, too If I can't help fallin' in love with you..."
Bright Mac,"Hey, no fair. I was gonna tell you the same thing."
Pear Butter,You're just mad I beat you to it.
Bright Mac,"I'm tellin' ya, I was gonna pull you up, cover your eyes, lead you over here... and say, ""Surprise!"" And then you'd say, [imitating Pear Butter] ""Oh, Bright Mac, I love it!"" [speaking normally] And then I'd say I love you. Too bad it didn't work out though."
Pear Butter,Eeyup. Too bad.
Grand Pear,The Pears are moving!
Applejack,"I mean, I figured the Pears moved, but I didn't know all that stuff happened before with Granny and Grand Pear."
Apple Bloom,It must've been really hard on our parents.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, it was."
Pear Butter,We're moving?! To Vanhoover?! But that's so far!
Grand Pear,It's what's best. There's acres of untouched land and a warehouse to make our jams. We'll get to expand our business and get away from those gosh-darned Apples.
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. [voiceover] Pear Butter was devastated. But seeing no way out of it, she did what she had to do."
Bright Mac,So that's it?
Pear Butter,"What do you want me to do, Bright Mac? We're movin'. I love you, but [tearing up] I have to stay with my family."
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. [voiceover] Then Bright Mac did the most romantic thing I've ever seen anypony do.
Apple Bloom,What?! What?!
Applejack,[simultaneous] What?! What did he do?!
Big McIntosh,[simultaneous] Tell us! Tell us!
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. We're gonna need one more pony to tell that story.
Apple Bloom,"Mayor Mare, you knew our parents?"
Mayor Mare,"Not as well as Mrs. Cake, but I did play a part in their love story. The night before the Pear family moved, Bright Mac asked me to meet him at the edge of Sweet Apple Acres."
Bright Mac,"I don't want to be apart from you. Ever. I'm not sure what we'll do, but I'm sure of us. So sure that I'd marry you today."
Pear Butter,"I would, too!"
Young Mayor Mare,I think that's my cue.
Mayor Mare,"[voiceover] I had the honor of officiating your parents' secret wedding, and it was perfect. Bright Mac knew Buttercup wouldn't want a big splash."
Apple Bloom,[voiceover] Reminds me of somepony else I know.
Big McIntosh,"[voiceover, chuckling] Eeyup."
Mayor Mare,[voiceover] So they had a special way to seal their vows.
Young Mayor Mare,I now pronounce you<U+0097>
Granny Smith,What is goin' on?! What's with all these here candles?!
Grand Pear,Pear Butter! Where are ya? You're supposed to be packing! [grimly] What are you two doing?
Bright Mac,"Ma, Grand Pear, Buttercup and I are in love!"
Granny Smith and Grand Pear,What?!
Pear Butter,And we'll be married as soon as Mayor Mare says...
Young Mayor Mare,Oh! [quickly] I now pronounce you husband and wife!
Granny Smith,"What are you talking about, married?! You two can't be married!"
Grand Pear,"Finally, something we can agree on. Pear Butter, enough of this nonsense. We're movin'! And you gotta stick with your family!"
Pear Butter,"But... the Apples are my family now, too."
Grand Pear,You can't be serious. Are you choosin' to be an Apple over being a Pear?!
Pear Butter,Are you makin' me choose?
Grand Pear,Yes. I am.
Pear Butter,Then yeah. I guess I am.
Grand Pear,Fine!
Applejack,I can't believe Grand Pear just up and left Ma like that! No wonder Granny never told us about any of this.
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. These things are never easy.
Mayor Mare,And it's hard to know when it is a good time.
Applejack,It seems to me that now's as good a time as any.
Apple Bloom,To talk to both our grandparents.
Apple Bloom,Excuse me? Grand Pear?
Applejack,"I'm Applejack, and this here's Big McIntosh. But you already know who we are, don't ya?"
Grand Pear,Sure do.
Apple Bloom,Did you really move to Ponyville just for a change of pace?
Grand Pear,No.
Apple Bloom,"Then you came here because you're sorry and that you wanted to get to know us, too?"
Grand Pear,"I'm... so sorry. I-I-I was just so angry, and... well, I-I never..."
Apple Bloom,"It's in the past, Grand Pear. Oh! Can I call you Grand Pear-Pear?"
Grand Pear,[chuckles] Sure can.
Granny Smith,Now where'd you all get to? I ain't seen hide or hair of ya's all day.
Applejack,We've been all over. Learnin' about our parents.
Granny Smith,Guh... Y-You have?
Applejack,And our grandfather.
Granny Smith,"So... you're back, huh?"
Grand Pear,Sure am. [mumbling] Never should've left.
Apple Bloom,"Findin' you and learnin' all about Mom and Dad, I feel like I found a piece of me I didn't even know was missin'."
Applejack,Hearin' their story makes me feel closer to them somehow.
Granny Smith,I'm sorry. I should've told you all about 'em sooner.
Grand Pear,"And I should've been here. Ah, I can't believe I let a silly feud keep me from my family."
Applejack,Nothing's keepin' ya from us now. Let's not miss anythin' else.
Granny Smith,"Applejack's right. Welcome back, prickly old pear. Heh."
Grand Pear,"[chuckles] Thanks, you old crabapple."
Apple Bloom,"Now that we're all together, there's somethin' we want to show you. Mom and Dad left us somethin' to remember them by. Come on!"
Grand Pear,Whoa.
Granny Smith,[sounds of awe] It's beautiful.
Grand Pear,It's... impossible.
Applejack,"If anything's gonna make it through, it's apples and pears."
Toola Roola,"Oops! Sorry, Princess Twilight. That was meant for her. Incoming!"
Twilight Sparkle,Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,"Toola Roola, Coconut Cream, what are you doing?!"
Coconut Cream,That was meant for my ex-friend.
Toola Roola,I'm not your ex-friend <U+0096> you're my ex-friend!
Twilight Sparkle,"Both of you, stop!"
Twilight Sparkle,"...So you see, friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for."
Twilight Sparkle,[humming and hmm-ing] No... Aha! Here it is.
Starlight Glimmer,What is that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Come on, Starlight, don't judge a book by its cover. This is the friendship journal my friends and I used to keep. It's filled with all the things we've learned, like: ""Friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for."""
Starlight Glimmer,I'll judge a book by its cover just this once.
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks for coming, everypony. I've got a surprise for you."
Fluttershy,"What is it, Twilight? Do I need to prepare myself?"
Twilight Sparkle,It's this!
Rarity,"Ugh, what is that thing? Why is it so smelly?"
Pinkie Pie,Wait a minute. [gasps] Is this our old friendship journal? I haven't seen this thing in forever!
Applejack,"Hoo-wee! It's lookin' a little, uh... overripe."
Rainbow Dash,I'll say!
Rainbow Dash,There's a smushed apple in Applejack's lessons.
Rainbow Dash,"Fluttershy's lessons are so small, you can barely read them."
Fluttershy,"I, uh, wanted to leave room for all of you."
Rainbow Dash,I-I don't even know what this is.
Rarity,"It is called calligraphy, darling. If you're going to make words, at least make them fabulous."
Applejack,"Looks like you got a little aggressive with your friendship lessons, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,"What can I say? When I learn something, I learn it hard."
Rainbow Dash,[unimpressed] I found Pinkie's page.
Pinkie Pie,"[giggles] Well, I am surprised!"
Twilight Sparkle,That wasn't the only surprise.
Twilight Sparkle,Ta-da! Starlight and I decided to make one for each of you!
Applejack,That's amazin'! A perfect copy!
Starlight Glimmer,I learned the spell years ago when I needed to make copies of a certain<U+0097> [long pause] [clears throat] ...manifesto.
Rarity,[sniffs] Ahhh! Even better than a perfect copy.
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'd forgotten all about this lesson."
Rainbow Dash,"[laughing] Remember this one from when I helped Daring Do? ""Never underestimate the power of friends who always got your back."""
Pinkie Pie,"Aww, Cheese Sandwich! Party cannon! Ah! Birth-iversary!"
Starlight Glimmer,"After Twilight remembered the journal, I had so much fun reading all the stuff you've all learned, I just had to have my own copy."
Twilight Sparkle,"And that brings me to the second part of the surprise. My idea. How would you girls feel about making our journal available for everypony? If we can get these lessons into other ponies' hooves, maybe they'll benefit from them."
Fluttershy,"Well, I think that's a great idea."
Pinkie Pie,I'm in! Yay!
Applejack,W-We always said we wanted to.
Rarity,Sounds fabulous.
Rainbow Dash,[laughing] I'm awesome.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, yeah. Uh, good idea."
Toola Roola,No! I don't wanna play with you anymore!
Coconut Cream,Why not?! You love playing hopskotch!
Toola Roola,"No, you do because you always win!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, girls. Couldn't help but overhear. You might want to take a breather, maybe read Rainbow Dash's chapter on Rainbow Falls? It might help."
Toola Roola,"Sure, Princess."
Apple Bloom,"Thanks, Twilight! The friendship journal's makin' us super popular!"
Twilight Sparkle,Oh.
Apple Bloom,"We were thinkin' of puttin' together a cutie mark summer camp. Now, everypony's definitely gonna sign up for it! This is gonna be awesome! [laughs] Cutie Mark Crusaders, whoo."
Starlight Glimmer,A cutie mark camp is a great idea.
Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, but the purpose of the journal isn't supposed to be marketing."
Twilight Sparkle,I just hope those foals actually learn something from our lessons.
Starlight Glimmer,They will! I'm sure ponies all across Equestria will<U+0097> Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, hello! Can I... help you?"
Out of Town Pony,We're here all the way from Fillydelphia because we got copies of your friendship journal!
Twilight Sparkle,Wow! How wonderful! What was your favorite friendship<U+0097>
Out of Town Pony,Will you sign them?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, uh, I guess so. So, what did you think of the lessons?"
Out of Town Pony,"Oh, we haven't read them. These are keepsakes. We gotta keep them in mint condition. Ha-ha."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh.
Out of Town Pony 2,"Wow, that was worth the trip!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure lots of other ponies are being inspired to be better friends."
Diamond Cutter,"Well, I for one found the journal terribly illuminating."
Daisy,I agree. I'm seeing sides of these ponies I didn't know were there. I only wish they'd left Rarity out. She clearly doesn't belong in that book with the rest of them.
Diamond Cutter,"Oh, I know! Who does she think she is? Certainly she did a fine job setting up the Ponyville Days celebration, but does she really believe it was a success just because of her? [inconsiderate laughter] The nerve!"
Twilight Sparkle,But that's not what she was saying! Rarity!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, poor Rarity. She overheard all the mean things those ponies were saying. She must be devastated. I'm going after her."
Starlight Glimmer,Go ahead. I'm gonna have a chat with these two.
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, wait!"
Pinkie Pie,Twilight! Isn't it amazing? Our journals are everywhere!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, I've got to<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,Ponies keep stopping by to tell me my entries are hilarious!
Pinkie Pie,I even had somepony come all the way from Las Pegasus to say how much he liked my lessons!
Twilight Sparkle,I am so glad to hear some ponies are being inspired by the journal.
Cherry Berry,"Hey, look! There's Pinkie Pie! The funny one!"
Pinkie Pie,Giggly feedback is the best kind!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, at least you're getting a positive reaction. I just saw Rarity, and I'm afraid this whole journal thing really upset her."
Pinkie Pie,"Aww, that's too bad."
Pinkie Pie,Wait. That wasn't even funny.
Twilight Sparkle,"O-kay. Well, I guess I'll catch you later."
Pinkie Pie,"Yup. Bye, Twilight!"
Sassaflash,"Hah! Classic Pinkie! Oh, she's even funnier in real life!"
Pinkie Pie,You've known me for years!
Rainbow Dash,Maybe it's time to call it a day.
Others,"""Princess Erroria"": I wipped out all the Twilight Spawkle lessons 'cause they were getting in the way of the good ones."
Twilight Sparkle,What do you mean you skipped the lessons? We've all had valuable experiences.
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, here's a great idea! Why don't you guys talk to Twilight for a while? So I can get back to things like working and napping and, well, pretty much anything else."
Others,"""Princess Erroria"": Aw, we don't wanna hear her bowing lessons! Come on! Tell us again about when you met Dawing Do!"
Rainbow Dash,[laughs nervously] Again? Haven't we already covered that one? A couple dozen times?
Others,"""Princess Erroria"": We can't get enough of it! Come on, you don't want to disappoint your fans!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh... It's just that I, uh, really need to get those storm clouds back in their... pens."
Others,"""Princess Erroria"": Oh, cool! We'll come along. You can tell us the stowy there."
Pegasus Fillies,Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, what's going on now?"
Fluttershy,"Please, just leave me alone!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, what's wrong?"
Glasses Stallion,We want answers!
Others,"""Lemon Chiffon"": Yeah! We're entitled to know!"
Twilight Sparkle,"What is it, everypony?"
Others,"""Lemon Chiffon"": We wanna know why Fluttershy keeps learning the same thing over and over again! Be assertive already!"
Others,"""Wisp"": Even I've learned more than she has! Why can't I be in the book?!"
Starlight Glimmer,What? Really?! Are you attacking my friend because you want to be in a book?!
Fluttershy,"It's okay. I got this, girls. [inhales] Listen up! I am more assertive! And yes, it took me a while to get there. But can you honestly say that you could learn something one time and completely change who you are? [beat] I didn't think so."
Glasses Stallion,Wow. You're way different from the Fluttershy in the book. I don't know how I feel about that.
Twilight Sparkle,"It feels like everypony in Equestria is missing the ""friendship"" part of the friendship journals."
Twilight Sparkle,What are you doing?
Rarity,"Why, I'm creating a gown, darling!"
Twilight Sparkle,For what?
Twilight Sparkle,Stress-sewing?
Rarity,"When I overheard those two at the cafe, I suddenly understood why I've been getting cancellations for days!"
Starlight Glimmer,What? Why are ponies cancelling their orders?
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sure if I go out there and talk to those ponies, they'll see that they're being unreasonable."
Applejack,"[panting] I need a hundred blankets, and I need 'em now! Sorry, Twilight."
Rarity,"Right away, pony-who-still-likes-me!"
Applejack,I don't need nothin' fancy.
Twilight Sparkle,"What's the matter, Applejack?"
Applejack,"I'm popular, Twilight! I'm popular, and I don't like it one bit!"
Starlight Glimmer,You go ahead. I'll stay here.
Twilight Sparkle,"Applejack, who are all these ponies?"
Applejack,"They call themselves the Sweet Apple Admirers. They say they read my journal entries, and they felt like a part of the family. And now they actually wanna become part of the family!"
Twilight Sparkle,Your journal entries?
Applejack,"Yeah, you know, all the stuff about how friends are like family and whatnot?"
Twilight Sparkle,Can't you get rid of them?
Applejack,"And kick out my own family?! Granny Smith, hang on! Let me help!"
Sweet Apple Admirer,There she is!
Ponies,Yee-haw!
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] I wish we'd never released that journal.
Starlight Glimmer,"There you are! Okay, I just left Rarity. I think she's doing better, and<U+0097> Oh, boy. Window-staring, huh? Was it that bad at Sweet Apple Acres?"
Twilight Sparkle,It's bad everywhere. I thought I was doing something good. I thought I was helping. How could our friendship journal have led to so much... anti-friendship?!
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, Twilight, it's not your fault."
Twilight Sparkle,"Of course it's my fault! If I hadn't had the big idea to make copies, none of this would be happening! I'm afraid I made life awful for my friends!"
Starlight Glimmer,I really think you're being too hard on yourself.
Twilight Sparkle,Am I?!
Applejack,I didn't know where else to go! I've got so much cookin' and cleanin' and family-in' to do... I ain't got time for anythin' else!
Pinkie Pie,"At least ponies aren't laughing every time you talk! Not even I want to be funny all the time! I'm telling you, my days of hilariosity-ness-ness are over!"
Rainbow Dash,"You think you've got problems? I know I'm awesome, but I can't even go to the bathroom without somepony trying to tell me how cool I am! [beat] Uh, Rarity? What are you wearing?"
Rarity,"My emotions, darling! Stress couture!"
Fluttershy,I don't know what I'm gonna do if I have to defend myself one more time!
Rarity,"Hmm? Oh, uh, sorry, darling. Force of habit."
Starlight Glimmer,"Okay, so maybe they are having a hard time with it. That doesn't mean you did anything wrong."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, I did! Releasing the journal was my idea, and it backfired in ways I could never have imagined!"
Starlight Glimmer,"It's not your fault. It's everypony else's! They're just focusing on the wrong things, and<U+0097> [gasps] Wait here! I've got an idea!"
Twilight Sparkle,I can't wait any longer. I've got to fix this.
Twilight Sparkle,"Everypony, please stop!"
Reporter Pony,"Princess Twilight, I'm with the Canterlot Chronicle. Quick question <U+0097> what would you say to ponies who wonder why you moved to Ponyville in the first place?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I moved here to learn about friendship. That's why the journal even exists. It took some time for me to get the hang of it, but it was each of these ponies standing next to me who taught me the lessons in those journals. Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy, too. Then it was all of you. I've learned so much from<U+0097>"
Reporter Pony,"What I mean is, some ponies would argue that it doesn't seem believable that the six of you would be friends."
Twilight Sparkle,"""Believable""?"
Reporter Pony,"Well, sure. I read this journal cover to cover, and I have to say your character would have been much more interesting if she'd stayed in Canterlot."
Twilight Sparkle,"My character?! We are real ponies! This journal is a record of things that actually happened to us! We made mistakes, and we learned from them!"
Diamond Cutter,What about Rarity? Are we really supposed to believe everything she wrote in there?
Others,"""Princess Erroria"": That's why you wanna be Team Dash! She's the only one that didn't weally need to learn anything, because she was alweady so cool."
Pearly Stitch,Twilight was better before she got wings!
Others,"""Lemon Chiffon"": Fluttershy is just so painfully shy, it's hard to relate! I mean, come on!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait a minute, everypony!"
Caramel,Are Pinkie Pie and Applejack related or what?!
Twilight Sparkle,Listen to me! [amplified] Listen to me!
Twilight Sparkle,I never claimed to be perfect My mistakes are all written in ink None of us claimed to be perfect And it's sad if that's what you all think
Others,Our flaws helped to make us special They bond us and keep us strong Our flaws are what brought us together So stop actin' like somethin's wrong
Mane Six,We're not flawless We're a work in progress We've got dents and we've got quirks But it's our flaws that make us work
Others,"Yeah, we're not flawless We're a work in progress So tell me what flaws you got, too 'Cause I still like what's flawed about you"
Rainbow Dash,They say I'm a big shot That my ego's the size of a whale My confidence comes off as cocky But it gives me the courage to fail
Rarity,"Sure, I can be a drama queen A bit stuck-up, it's true"
Applejack,"And I can be too eager to please There's such thing as bein' too honest, too, 'cause"
Mane Six,We're not flawless We're a work in progress We've got dents and we've got quirks But it's our flaws that make us work
Others,"Yeah, we're not flawless We're a work in progress So tell me what flaws you got, too 'Cause I still like what's flawed about you"
Pinkie Pie,Ponies think I'm all bubbles and laughter That I don't seem sincere I might joke around a little too much But I'm just so happy you're here
Fluttershy,It took me a while to be confident To really come out of my shell
Twilight Sparkle,"But nopony has to be perfect By now, don't you know us so well? Because, yeah"
Mane Six,We're not flawless We're a work in progress We've got dents and we've got quirks But it's our flaws that make us work
Others,"Yeah, we're not flawless We're a work in progress So tell me what flaws you got, too ( You got, too) 'Cause I still like what's flawed about you"
Twilight Sparkle,"So you see, everypony? None of us ever claimed to be perfect. Without our flaws, there wouldn't be any friendship lessons to learn. Without our flaws... there probably wouldn't be any friendships at all."
Rainbow Dash,So that just happened.
Starlight Glimmer,Girls! I found two ponies who have something I think you should hear.
Toola Roola,"Um, we just wanted to say thank you. To all of you."
Coconut Cream,"Yeah, our friendship? Well, we were having trouble until we read your journal. It showed us that friends can go through all sorts of tough times and come through stronger than before."
Toola Roola,It's made us better friends than we've ever been!
Twilight Sparkle,Really?
Coconut Cream and Toola Roola,Mm-hmm.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to hear that. Thank you for telling us. We've had a tough couple of days, but knowing we've helped fillies like you..."
Applejack,It makes everythin' we've been through worth it.
Rarity,Absolutely. Fads come and go. Friendship is forever.
Rainbow Dash,There are worse things than not being able to do anything without being told I'm awesome.
Fluttershy,And we can't change the way other ponies think about us. But we can change how we let it affect us.
Pinkie Pie,Or how we don't let it affect us!
Pinkie Pie,[giggles] Go ahead! Laugh!
Applejack,"Reckon we still have to deal with them, don't we?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Stay in the friendship moment, Applejack. They can wait a little longer."
Spike,"Is the banner even? Are the flowers in place? By which I mean ""completely out of view"". I'm pretty sure dragons don't like flowers. And what about the Ceremonial Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship? Is it still flaming?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, everything looks great! You're getting yourself worked up for no reason."
Spike,"I have lots of reasons. In fact, I wrote them down."
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] You've been hanging around Twilight for too long.
Spike,Reason number one <U+0096> I invited Dragon Lord Ember to Ponyville today. Reason two <U+0096> the Dragon Lord is a dragon. Reason three <U+0096> she's coming here to learn more about friendship.
Twilight Sparkle,"According to Ember's letters, the dragons are trying to be friends, but competing is in their nature, and it's leading to more and more fights."
Spike,"Which brings me to to reason number four. The Dragon Lord wants my advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down."
Twilight Sparkle,"I know you feel a lot of pressure, but you've got this, Spike!"
Spike,I... I just want things to be perfect.
Spike,[gasps] Thorax! You're in Ponyville!
Thorax,"Of course I am, silly! You invited me. And I'm not one to back out of an invitation. Hey, Twilight! Hey, Starlight!"
Thorax,"Oooh! I can't believe you did all this for me! Great banner! Love the stage! What's this flame thingy? Oh, it's pretty!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[whispering, to Spike] You invited Thorax over to Ponyville on the same day as Ember?!"
Spike,Apparently.
Starlight Glimmer,That doesn't seem like a good idea. How are you gonna entertain them both?
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, maybe they'll like each other."
Spike,Probably not. Ember is tough and self-assured and intimidating. And Thorax is...
Thorax,"Spike, I'm so glad you invited me! You are one of my closest, nicest, most caring, most understanding friends ever! Ooh! Is that ice in the shape of a dragon?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah, I see your point. They might not get each other."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm sure that won't happen. Now pull it together.
Spike,"So, heh, Thorax, heh, everything good with you?"
Thorax,"Well, honestly, no. Not really. I have indigestion. Not sure if it's the new diet or stress. Or maybe it's both."
Spike,No!
Thorax,"Yeah, it really could be both. And it might be affecting my sleeping, too. I'm a real tosser and turner."
Spike,"Sounds like you really need to unwind. Uh, how about a, uh... a trip to the castle? Heh. You can't miss that view."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, the castle! I'll give you a personal tour!"
Thorax,"Uh, aren't you coming?"
Spike,"Yeah, I'm just gonna... grab some ice cream for us and catch up. Heh-heh."
Spike,"Dragon Lord Ember, as the official Equestrian friendship ambassador for the Dragon Lands and for Ponyville, I, Spike of Ponyville, welcome you to... uh, Ponyville. [quietly, to himself] I gotta work on my official speech."
Ember,"Okay, thanks. [chuckles] Right. The hug thing."
Ember,That's probably why.
Ember,"Hey, Twilight!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, I'm Starlight. Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you."
Ember,"Oh, sorry. I'm really gonna have to get used to these pony names. Lots of ""-lights"" and shiny things. So, where is Twilight?"
Spike,She's in her castle. D'oh!
Ember,"We should go visit her then. Part of friendship is saying ""hi"" to your friends, right?"
Ember,You're making weird noises. Do you have a stomachache?
Spike,Dah. I think I feel one coming on.
Ember,"Well, you know what us dragons say. ""Push past the pain!"" Now, let's go."
Spike,Or we could stay here.
Ember,Or I could go without you.
Starlight Glimmer,"[laughs] Ah, I like her."
Spike,Ohhh.
Spike,Good. They're not here.
Ember,What was that?
Spike,"Uh, I... I said, ""It's all clean in here!"" Uh, you must be hungry from your travels. Please, I'd love to present you with an official friendship welcome banquet."
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, that's not food."
Spike,[aside] Dragons love gems!
Starlight Glimmer,"Fine, but you're telling Twilight what happened to her wall."
Spike,"Just keep her here. [to Ember] Okay, yeah! [laughs] Enjoy all the, uh... crystal... things!"
Ember,Where are you going? I thought this was an official friendship banquet.
Spike,Just gotta use the little dragons' room!
Twilight Sparkle,So this is my comfy chair for fictional reads. [grunts] This is my studying chair because the hard back keeps me awake.
Thorax,"Oh, Spike! I'm so glad you're here! [quietly] This castle visit is getting weird. Twilight really likes chairs. Oh, what happened to the ice cream?"
Spike,"What? Oh, right! Uh, they ran out. Heh. Hey, I'm really sorry, but I gotta borrow Twilight quickly."
Twilight Sparkle,Aah!
Spike,Be right back!
Spike,Ember's here!
Twilight Sparkle,I know. I saw you coming and had to distract Thorax by showing him chairs. Why did you bring Ember to the castle of all places?
Spike,"I don't know! Ember was asking for you, Thorax wants to talk with me. We need to switch places! They might be getting suspicious."
Twilight Sparkle,All we have to do is make both Thorax and Ember feel special and keep them apart for a few more hours. We can do this.
Twilight Sparkle,"I think it's the map. It's calling... you. Apparently, you also have to solve a friendship problem!"
Spike,The map is calling me?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, amazing! The map is really reaching out!"
Twilight Sparkle,Not a good time? I get it.
Starlight Glimmer,"Spike, are you here? Ember's eaten all of Twilight's decorations, and<U+0097>oh! Hey, Twilight! [chuckles, gasps] Glowing map... [gulps] Glowing spikes... That's not good."
Spike,I know!
Starlight Glimmer,At least your friendship problem is in Ponyville? Heh.
Spike,"Okay, okay. To pull this off, I'm gonna need both of you to help. You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I get ice cream."
Twilight Sparkle,"You mean ""find the friendship problem""."
Spike,Yeeeees! Go easy on me. I'm under a lot of pressure.
Spike,Friendship problem? Anypony gotta friendship problem here? Any problems to solve? Friendship problems? Friendship problems! Anypony got a friendship problem here? No? Okay.
Lyra Heartstrings,"[grunts] Well, I think vanilla strawberry cream is overused!"
Sweetie Drops,Hmph.
Spike,"Yes! Fighting! Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Ember, there you are!"
Ember,"Okay, right. More pony hugs."
Twilight Sparkle,How's your trip to Ponyville so far?
Ember,"Well, I'm certainly learning a lot about friendship. I had no idea it was polite to decorate your walls in your friends' favorite foods!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[laughs nervously] Oh, my."
Twilight Sparkle,"Nooooo. They're just making sure everything is perfect for your welcome party later. In the meantime, how about I show you around town?"
Ember,Sounds good. I can't exactly learn about friendship if I don't make new friends.
Thorax,Oh!
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, hey, Thorax. Um, Twilight and Spike had some boring official paperwork to deal with, so looks like you and I get to hang out. What would you like to do?"
Thorax,But I wanted to talk with Spike. He said he'd be right back.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, you will. But first, how about we grab a bite to eat?"
Thorax,"Huh. Well, you know, now that you've said it, I am a little hungry. Is there a dining room in the castle?"
Starlight Glimmer,"No! I mean, yeah, but that's castle food. If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town. Phew!"
Spike,...and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship.
Lyra Heartstrings,"Huh. I guess I never thought of it that way. Thanks, Spike!"
Spike,"Oh, come on! Glow!"
Thorax,"Spike! There you are! Uh, done with your boring paperwork, I see."
Starlight Glimmer,[laughs nervously] Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Spike,Yep. [laughs] I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing.
Starlight Glimmer,"Thorax wanted to get out of the castle. I thought coming to town was a really, really great idea."
Thorax,"Well, maybe now we can talk."
Spike,"Uh, sssssure."
Starlight Glimmer,I'll leave you guys to it.
Thorax,"First of all, I want to say thank you for having me over. I'm in a bit of a leadership pickle, and I could use some advice."
Spike,"Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible."
Ember,"Usually when I do that, the dragons are eager to meet me."
Twilight Sparkle,That's not how ponies make friends.
Ember,"Ah, I get it."
Ember,"This is a weird friendship thing you ponies do, right?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, you guys are in town, too?"
Ember,What are you talking about? You've been with me this whole time.
Starlight Glimmer,No. I'm Starlight.
Ember,"Riiiight. I'm sorry, but you can't blame me. You both look and act so much alike."
Twilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer,What?!
Thorax,"...and they said to me they just keep saying the same thing. You know, I think my leadership problem started in childhood. I must've been three when... [crossfades] ...three's a different story, a-and you've definitely gotta hear it. But the story about my brother was when I was two... or was I one?"
Crusoe Palm,This is my seat! I saw it first!
Others,"""Rainbow Stars"": Well, I got here first!"
Spike,"Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second."
Thorax,"Hey, that was really great advice. So what do you think I should do?"
Spike,"[gasps] Uh, actually, I, uh... need a minute... alone... to, uh, really come up with great advice! [pants] I'll be right back."
Thorax,[sighs] Great. No problem. Leave me again. It's fine.
Ember,I'm just saying you're both purple ponies with purple hair. You both have cutie marks with sparkly things.
Starlight Glimmer,[chuckles] Mine's more of a glimmer. Heh.
Ember,"How is that different? Oh, good. Spike. Can you please tell these two I'm right? They look very similar."
Spike,"Uh... Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else."
Ember,"But I'm right! Besides, who are you to be telling me about friendship? I've barely seen you all day!"
Spike,"Uh, well, I've seen you."
Ember,Are you calling me a liar?!
Thorax,Hey! No one yells at my friend!
Ember,"Spike, get away from the bear!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, the bear is a changeling. And he's quite gentle."
Spike,[screams] My worst fears are happening!
Spike,Noooo!
Thorax,"[pants] Back away, Spike! I'm not gonna let this dragon harm a scale on your back!"
Ember,You back away! I'm not gonna let you harm him! Wait. Did you say you're not gonna let me harm Spike?
Thorax,Yeah!
Ember,But that's what I'm doing!
Thorax,"Uh, what?"
Ember,"Yeah, what?"
Spike,[panicked] Equestria as we know it is over! The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin! And it's all my fault! My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie<U+0097>! Oh. Hey. You guys aren't fighting?
Ember,Why would we be fighting?
Spike,Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?
Ember and Thorax,So what?
Spike,So I... was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along.
Ember,Oh. I get it. You thought he wouldn't like me just because I'm a dragon and I'm bad at friendship?
Spike,"No, no, of course not! But<U+0097> Wait. Isn't that why you're here?"
Ember,I can say I'm bad at friendship. You can't say it about me! You know what? I don't wanna talk about it.
Spike,"Wait, please! [sighs] [to Thorax] I'm sorry."
Thorax,"No, no, it's cool. You thought I would be too soft, and someone like Ember would never respect me. Just like my own changelings!"
Spike,"No, that's not it! Thorax, wait! Oh, no... What have I done?"
Ember,Why are you still here?
Thorax,"[sighs] Because I'm having trouble leading my pack, so I don't really wanna go home."
Ember,"Wait, you're in charge? [chuckles] Oh, boy. You need to be more assertive."
Thorax,"Well, that's my problem. I don't know how! I tried asking them to please follow my directions. I even offered a prize, and then<U+0097>"
Ember,Shhh! Stop talking.
Ember,That's how you do it.
Thorax,Whoa! That just gave me chills.
Ember,I know you have it in you. You turned into a bear to defend Spike.
Thorax,"Huh, I guess I can be tough when I'm defending my friends, but when I'm just enforcing my rules, I-I feel unsure of myself."
Ember,"There's nothing to be unsure of. You're the leader for a reason. Make a decision and let it be known that the decision is final. And if that doesn't work, turn into a bear."
Thorax,"Oh, well, that's good advice."
Ember,I know it is.
Thorax,So what's your deal? Why do you think you're so bad at friendship?
Ember,I don't want to talk about it.
Thorax,"Oh, you have to! How else are you gonna solve your problems?"
Thorax,"Uh, how does that help?"
Ember,Crushing another dragon in competition establishes my dominance and makes me feel great.
Thorax,"Right, but, uh, how do you think they feel?"
Ember,Humiliated! Ashamed! They'd probably wanna run away and bury themselves under a rock and... never come out. They're probably sad. Kinda low. Definitely not happy.
Thorax,That's because that kind of competition can divide you. And it doesn't get to the heart of the issue. Talking about your feelings does.
Ember,[sneezes] Ugh! I think I'm allergic to feelings.
Thorax,You know you don't have to be sappy...
Thorax,...or huggy-feely about it! But you should let your friends know how you feel.
Ember,"Uh, I know where we can start."
Thorax,Where? Ohhhh. Spike. Hah. I got there.
Spike,I think they're gone. They probably never want to see me again.
Starlight Glimmer,Or they want to see you now.
Ember,"Guess what, Spike."
Spike,I know. I'm so sorry.
Thorax,Okaaaay... That's a good first attempt. Now maybe try to be more specific?
Ember,"[cracks limbs, breathes deeply] I'm... [sighs] upset!"
Spike,You have every right to be.
Ember,I know I do! And I know I need to tell you how I feel because my friend Thorax said it would make me feel better. And it does!
Thorax,Yeah! And I have no problem telling you what you did was wrong because my friend Ember is helping me be more assertive!
Spike,Whoa.
Ember,Nice.
Ember and Thorax,Ha-ha!
Spike,"You guys should be mad at me. I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right. [sighs] Can you forgive me?"
Ember,"I really do feel better. So, yeah. I'm good."
Ember,[groans] Again?
Spike,No way! It's finally happening! I solved the friendship problem!
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, you created the friendship problem by not trusting your friends."
Spike,"Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson. I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead of assuming they wouldn't get along."
Twilight Sparkle,"Good job, Spike."
Ember,Is this another part of pony friendship? Telling each other what you learned all the time?
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah, pretty much."
Spike,Yup.
Spike,"[through loudspeaker] So, as a show of unity, I present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack! May the flame of friendship burn for eternity."
Ember,You should have more things made of rocks.
Applejack,"[straining] [muffled] Hey, kid, get over here!"
Applejack,"Tents are lookin' good. And we made good time today. At this rate, we'll be at Winsome Falls by tomorrow!"
Apple Bloom,We should do the annual Big-Sister-Little-Sister camping trip every weekend!
Applejack,"Then it wouldn't be annual. And if we did it every weekend, it probably wouldn't be as special."
Apple Bloom,"But the more we do it, the better we get at camping. Remember the first time we came here and Rarity had that ginormous tent?"
Rarity,"I heard that! [giggles] I've gotten much better at ""roughing it"", haven't I?"
Sweetie Belle,"Yup. This time, you only packed three suitcases."
Rarity,"I know what you're thinking. But I promise, I only brought the essentials."
Applejack,Like those light thingies?
Rarity,Of course. What is life if you can't make it beautiful?
Rainbow Dash,Mmmm! These berries look good enough to eat!
Scootaloo,"Don't! According to my book, they're extremely poisonous!"
Rainbow Dash,What?
Scootaloo,"I heard something, I stepped on something, and I saw that creepy cave... I guess I still get a little bit scared out here, even after the last camping trip."
Rainbow Dash,"Don't worry, kid. You've got a big sister this time."
Apple Bloom,This looks amazing!
Scootaloo,This is gonna be the best Big-Sister-Slash-Little-Sister camping trip ever!
Scootaloo,Ow! What are these things?! Aaagh!
Applejack,"Fly-ders! Everypony, run for cover! Don't get stuck in their<U+0097>"
Applejack,...web.
Sweetie Belle,[shrieks] Now what?!
Rainbow Dash,"Follow me, everypony!"
Scootaloo,Aaah! Not the scary cave!
Scootaloo,Where did those terrible bugs come from? And why did they destroy our camp?
Rainbow Dash,Ugh.
Applejack,"Flyders are from the Luna Bay area. Never seen 'em this far east, though. Probably attracted to the food. Best wait here until they're gone."
Apple Bloom,"Oh, apple rot! What are we supposed to do now?! We had games to play and marshmallows to roast at camp! In here, we got nothin'!"
Rarity,"Mm, that's not entirely true. We have each other."
Applejack,"That's right! And if you girls want to, maybe we could tell some stories to pass the time."
Rainbow Dash,You want stories? I've got a ton of stories! Spoiler alert <U+0096> they're all about me and how awesome I am!
Applejack,I was thinkin' more like campfire stories?
Apple Bloom,But we don't even have a campfire.
Rainbow Dash,I got this!
Applejack,Wow. That was brave.
Scootaloo,"We aren't gonna tell scary stories like our last camping trip, are we? It's bad enough just being in here!"
Applejack,"Don't worry, Scootaloo. I was gonna tell you mine and Apple Bloom's favorite legend."
Apple Bloom,"Ooh! You mean Rockhoof? I love that one! He was so strong, and when he<U+0097>"
Sweetie Belle,"Apple Bloom, shhh! We haven't heard it yet!"
Apple Bloom,"Oh, okay. But it's so good! Heh."
Applejack,"Well, it's true. Rockhoof was known far and wide for his incredible strength. But he didn't start out that way. You see, Rockhoof was a tiny little fella, the son of a farmer."
Apple Bloom,Just like us!
Applejack,They lived in a village that sat at the foot of a gigantic volcano.
Applejack,[narrating] And the village was protected by an elite group of guard ponies called the Mighty Helm.
Applejack,[narrating] Young Rockhoof wanted nothing more than to be part of the Mighty Helm.
Applejack,[narrating] But he was told that he was too scrawny and weak to protect the village.
Applejack,[narrating] But Rockhoof wouldn't take no for an answer.
Applejack,"[narrating] Then, one fateful day..."
Applejack,[narrating] ...the volcano erupted!
Rockhoof,Eeeeeeeeeeee<U+0097>
Apple Bloom,[continued] <U+0097>eeeeeeeeee! This is my favorite part!
Others,"Rainbow Dash, What happened next?!"
Applejack,The molten lava poured down the side of the volcano...
Applejack,"[narrating] ...and try as they might, the Mighty Helm couldn't figure out a way to save the village! They had to evacuate. But the village ponies didn't wanna leave their homes. They spent their entire lives there. They had nowhere else to go! So Rockhoof decided to do something crazy."
Applejack,"[narrating] He thought if he could divert the flow of the lava, he might be able to save his village. He started diggin' a trench!"
Sweetie Belle,Wait a minute. All by himself?
Rainbow Dash,"It'd be impossible for one pony to dig a trench fast enough to stop the lava. I mean, even I couldn't do that."
Applejack,"Good thing Rockhoof didn't believe in the word ""impossible""."
Applejack,"[narrating] He continued to work, knowin' the odds were against him, but determined to push through it. Then, somethin' magical happened."
Applejack,[narrating] Rockhoof got visibly stronger! But the lava was getting' closer.
Applejack,"[narrating] Through his extraordinary determination and sheer force o' will, Rockhoof more than earned his place in the Mighty Helm."
Rainbow Dash,"Good story, Applejack! Even if it wasn't about me."
Apple Bloom,"I love that story, no matter how many times I hear it."
Rarity,Why don't we see if it's safe to head back to camp?
Sweetie Belle,"Uh, girls? There is no camp to go back to."
Sweetie Belle,All our hard work is ruined!
Rarity,"There, there, Sweetie Belle. Not to worry."
Sweetie Belle,"How? Our camp was so pretty, and this cave is so... not."
Rarity,"Oh, no-no-no-no, no, not true. There's beauty in everything. Even these blah rocks aren't really blah. If you look closely, you can see flecks of gold in them. And the way the firelight dances on the cave wall, shadow and light? Ooh, it's so gorgeous! Sweetie Belle, have I ever told you about my favorite legend?"
Sweetie Belle,No. I didn't know you had one.
Rarity,Her name... was Mistmane.
Rainbow Dash,Mistmane? Isn't she the old wrinkly sorceress with the flower?
Rarity,"Yeeees, but did you know she used to be the most beautiful unicorn in all the land?"
Rainbow Dash,[flatly] No.
Cutie Mark Crusaders,So what happened to her?!
Rarity,"Well, Mistmane was a very promising young sorceress."
Rarity,[narrating] She was as talented as she was beautiful and kind. Everypony loved her and missed her when she was sent to the finest magic school.
Rarity,"[narrating] While she was gone, she was delighted to find out that her best friend, Sable Spirit, was crowned empress. She couldn't wait to return home once she finished her studies."
Rarity,"[narrating] But once she arrived, she was devastated by what she saw."
Mistmane,What happened here?
Villager,The Empress happened. She makes everypony work day and night on her palace. We don't have time to take care of anything else.
Mistmane,But that can't be. I know her! She would never do this.
Rarity,[narrating] But there was no denying what was in front of her.
Rarity,[narrating] Sable Spirit took everything that was beautiful away from anypony else! And Mistmane was sure there had to be some explanation.
Sweetie Belle,"I'd assume there was, too. If somepony told me either one of you two'd gone evil..."
Scootaloo,"Yeah, I'd never believe it."
Apple Bloom,I dunno. I've seen the way you two get when you miss breakfast.
Apple Bloom,[chuckles nervously] Just kiddin'. But I'd want answers too.
Rarity,So did Mistmane. She went to confront her friend.
Mistmane,"Sable, is that you?"
Sable Spirit,Don't tell me you don't recognize your old friend.
Mistmane,I don't. My friend would never work our families and friends to the bone for something as silly as a palace.
Sable Spirit,Silly? My palace is a beacon of beauty! Anypony who passes will be in awe of its majesty!
Mistmane,What good is a pretty palace if it just hides the misery of its ponies?
Sable Spirit,Beauty is everything. You taught me that.
Mistmane,What?!
Sable Spirit,"You were always the pretty one. You got to go to the best magic school. Everypony missed you. Everypony loved you! I admit I was jealous, so I tried to perform a spell that would make me beautiful. You can see how that went!"
Sable Spirit,"I found if I couldn't have beauty, I would take it. I wasn't chosen to be empress, you know. I took it! Just like I'm going to take everything else."
Mistmane,I can't let you do that.
Rarity,"[narrating] Everypony thought Sable Spirit was defeated, and that was that. But Mistmane knew there was more she could do to help."
Rarity,[narrating] Beauty isn't everything. But Mistmane knew that it does have the power to make ponies smile.
Rarity,[narrating] She made a huge sacrifice to bring that smile back to her friends' and family's faces... including Sable Spirit's.
Sable Spirit,[gasps] You did this for me? Even after I was so cruel?
Rarity,"[narrating] Sable Spirit was so touched that she vowed to be more like her friend in the ways that mattered. From then on, she ruled with kindness and compassion."
Rarity,"[narrating] Even though she gave away her physical beauty, she dedicated her life to spreading beauty all over Equestria. Any time you go out of your way to brighten somepony's day by doing something like giving them flowers, you're following in the hoofsteps of Mistmane."
Sweetie Belle,I think she's my favorite legend too.
Rainbow Dash,Ugh! These Fly-ders won't quit! What do they want from us now?
Applejack,"Well, like it or not, we're food, too."
Sweetie Belle,And I've got the bites to prove it.
Scootaloo,[panicking] What are we gonna do?! They're almost here!
Rainbow Dash,What?! Now those bugs can't get in!
Scootaloo,[hyperventilating] And we can't get out!
Applejack,Let's all just stay calm. Let me re-light this fire...
Rarity,We just have to wait until the swarm moves on. Then we'll think of a way out.
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Scootaloo. You're focusing on the wrong things."
Scootaloo,You have a plan?!
Rainbow Dash,Close. I have a story.
Applejack,Lemme guess <U+0096> it's about you?
Rainbow Dash,"Practically. It's about my favorite legend, Flash Magnus!"
Apple Bloom,Wasn't he the pony who took on the dragons?
Scootaloo,"Dragons?! Big, scary, mean ones or like Spike?"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, these were definitely the big, scary, mean kind!"
Rainbow Dash,But not too scary. You can sit closer to me if you want.
Rainbow Dash,"A long time ago, before the Wonderbolts were even founded..."
Rainbow Dash,[narrating] ...Flash Magnus was a lowly cadet in the Royal Legion.
Rainbow Dash,[narrating] And the Legion needed to fly over the Dragon Lands to get to their comrades on the other side. But as they got closer to the dragons...
Rainbow Dash,[narrating] ...the dragons attacked!
Scootaloo,[shivering] You said this wasn't too scary!
Rainbow Dash,"[very muffled] Scootaloo, if you just hang in there<U+0097>"
Scootaloo,What?
Rainbow Dash,"I said if you just hang in there, I promise you'll like the ending. So, like I was saying, Flash Magnus and the Royal Legion tried to get past the dragons..."
Rainbow Dash,[narrating] ...but the dragons wouldn't let them!
Commander Ironhead,"Everypony, retreat!"
Rainbow Dash,"[narrating] Flash Magnus and a few other cadets were separated from the battalion. He managed to get away, but the dragons captured his friends and took them back to their lair!"
Flash Magnus,Commander! We need to save our captured comrades!
Commander Ironhead,"I appreciate your loyalty, Flash Magnus, but getting past those dragons is going to be impossible. Nothing will work."
Apple Bloom,The commander was right. You can't outfight dragons.
Rainbow Dash,But you can out-think them.
Flash Magnus,"Commander Ironhead, I'm pretty sure I can outfly the dragons. If I can lure them into chasing me, you can all sneak into the lair and retrieve our friends before they get back."
Commander Ironhead,"Are you really willing to take that chance, soldier?"
Flash Magnus,"I am, sir."
Commander Ironhead,It's a very brave thing you're doing. You'll need all the help you can get.
Flash Magnus,"Is this... Netitus, the fireproof shield?!"
Commander Ironhead,"It has protected Legion heroes for generations. And today, I can't think of a worthier flank for Netitus to protect."
Commander Ironhead,"Good luck, soldier."
Flash Magnus,"[exhales] [shouting] Hey! Come and get me, fire-breath! If you can! [clanking shield] Hey, hey! Come and get me! Hey, I'm over here!"
Rainbow Dash,"[narrating] While Flash Magnus bravely flew for his life, Commander Ironhoof was able to get his soldiers back."
Rainbow Dash,[narrating] Flash Magnus flew like the wind...
Rainbow Dash,[narrating] ...faster than the dragons!
Rainbow Dash,"[narrating] But he knew he couldn't do this forever. Luckily, he had a plan."
Rainbow Dash,[narrating] He led the dragons straight into a storm that the Legion had planted!
Rainbow Dash,"[narrating] One taste of the lightning, and the dragons retreated."
Rainbow Dash,[narrating] Flash Magnus' plan worked!
Scootaloo,Wow! I did like that ending.
Rainbow Dash,Told ya! He always inspired me to be my brave and awesome self.
Apple Bloom,Mm-hmm!
Applejack,"Yeah, I guess he kinda reminds me of you."
Rainbow Dash,"Tch! You guess? Come on, I'm just like him!"
Applejack,"Hey, do you hear that?"
Apple Bloom,"Uh, I don't hear anythin'."
Applejack,Exactly! Those gosh-darn Fly-ders are gone! We can get out!
Applejack,Whoa!
Rarity,Or not.
Applejack,We're gonna have to see if we can get out the other way.
Scootaloo,"You mean go further into the dark, spooky cave?!"
Rainbow Dash,"Scootaloo, just remember the story. Gotta be brave like me and Flash Magnus, okay?"
Rainbow Dash,I hear water!
Rarity,"And if there's flowing water, then..."
Applejack,...it might lead to the way out!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Whoa!
Rarity,"Okay, on three. One, two<U+0097>"
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Three!
Apple Bloom,Woo-hoo!
Sweetie Belle,Yeah-ha-ha!
Applejack,"Huh. Well, what do you know? We found ourselves a shortcut to Winsome Falls!"
Scootaloo,[sighs] It's never looked so beautiful.
Rarity,"Well, almost."
Applejack,We sure are sorry that our camping trip wasn't what we hoped it would be.
Apple Bloom,Are you kidding? This trip is awesome!
Rarity,It is?
Sweetie Belle,We got to hear legendary stories and go on an adventure.
Applejack,"Wait, you three wanna stay?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Of course we do!
Sweetie Belle,"We could turn those trees into a nice, little shelter!"
Apple Bloom,We can get you some big logs and branches to help build it!
Scootaloo,And I bet we could find some more berries! Come on! I can't wait to see what happens next year!
Starlight Glimmer,Ha! Straight to the changeling hive! I told you I could do it.
Trixie,"Well, not exactly straight, Starlight. We've been popping all around Equestria, and we still have to walk."
Starlight Glimmer,"[scoffs] It's like twelve steps away. Before Chrysalis' throne was destroyed, the closest magic would've gotten us was waaaaaaay over there. On a scale of one to ten, how happy do you think Thorax is gonna be about our surprise visit?"
Trixie,"Definitely ten. I mean, who wouldn't be happy at the chance to marvel at the overwhelming talent that is the Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie?!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, we're coming to offer Thorax encouragement and support. His letters make it seem like the responsibilities of being a changeling leader are a little overwhelming."
Trixie,Yeah. I know. That's basically what I said.
Starlight Glimmer,"He's dealing with the wants and needs of his subjects. Redesigning the hive, a dread maulwurf wreaking havoc outside..."
Trixie,"It does sound like a lot, but are you sure that last thing is real?"
Starlight Glimmer,"The dread maulwurf? Sure it is. Thorax said it's like half-bear, half-mole, half-raging-pile-of-claws! But now that the changelings don't feed on the love of everything around them, plants have started to grow back. But this maulwurf keeps eating them all up."
Trixie,"""Maulwurf"". Uh-huh. You're just trying to scare me, but it won't work. Because not only am I the Great and Powerful, I am also the Unscareable Trixie!"
Trixie,[screams] Please tell me Thorax also mentioned a terrifying-looking changeling who greets visitors but is actually nice!
Starlight Glimmer,[meakly] Nope.
Trixie,"Starlight, you got us here. I'll take us home. Teleportation spell, go! Did I save us?"
Starlight Glimmer,Nope.
Trixie,What are you waiting for?! Use some magic to get us outta here!
Starlight Glimmer,"Calm down, ""Unscareable Trixie"". We have to find out what's going on. Thorax might need our help."
Trixie,"We need our help! Teleportation spell, go! Teleportation spell, go! [gasps] Teleportation spell<U+0097>!"
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh! Why do you keep doing that? You know it doesn't work that way.
Trixie,"I know, but this is my process."
Pharynx,I've captured these trespassers!
Thorax,"Starlight! Trixie! It's okay, Pharynx. You can let them go."
Pharynx,"But they were lurking on our grounds! In the old days, I would've already feasted on their love."
Thorax,"Well, that's why they're called the ""old days"", because they're old. We don't do that anymore."
Pharynx,Dah! I liked the old days better.
Thorax,"Uh, what are you two doing here?"
Starlight Glimmer,We wanted to surprise you. [sheepishly] Surprise.
Thorax,"Well, it's great to see you! I'm sorry about the welcome committee."
Starlight Glimmer,I thought Ember helped you get more assertive so you could deal with all the renegade changelings who didn't wanna change.
Thorax,"Oh, she did. Really helpful. I was able to convince all of them to change, except one of them... My brother."
Starlight Glimmer,Your brother?
Thorax,Yep. Pharynx is my elder broodmate.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, yeah. You guys have the same... um... eye shape?"
Pharynx,What a ridiculous comparison! We are nothing alike!
Thorax,Stop doing that!
Thorax,"Ugh. Well, how about I show you the rest of the hive where it's less loud and bangy?"
Thorax,"There've been a lot of changes since you were here last. I'm trying to start some new activities since the only thing we did before was hunt and patrol. There's theatre, swing dancing, a once-a-week potluck lunch. Ooh! And who can change shape and organize craft time? Hmm? [transformation noise] This guy!"
Starlight Glimmer,"I am really impressed, Thorax. The hive, all the activities..."
Sclerite,"Gah! He did it again! Pharynx dumped an entire can of black paint on me! He said my fuchsia color wasn't ""intimidating to our enemies""! What enemies?!"
Thorax,I am so sorry. I promise I'll talk to him.
Sclerite,"You're the ruler of the hive, Thorax! You need to do more than talk!"
Trixie,"Well, maybe not everything here is amazing."
Starlight Glimmer,"Seriously, Thorax. What is up with your brother?"
Thorax,"Ugh. Pharynx used to be head of patrol. But now we're peaceful and there's no need to patrol, so he just stalks around the hive making everyone miserable. The other changelings are sick of it, and if I can't get him to accept love and friendship and change like the rest of us, everything I've done here is at risk."
Trixie,Uh-uh.
Starlight Glimmer,[encouragingly] Hmm?
Trixie,[sighs] Uh-huh.
Starlight Glimmer,We know a thing or two about what it's like to be outsiders. Maybe we could talk to him for you.
Thorax,Do you really think you can help?
Trixie,"Thorax, if there's anypony who can help your brother, it's me. And with Starlight helping, it might take slightly longer, but I guarantee you we can do it."
Frenulum,"Thorax, we're ready to start work on the trail of plants to lead the maulwurf away."
Thorax,"Oh, I have to head outside. You sure you're okay handling Pharynx?"
Starlight Glimmer,Absolutely.
Trixie,"So, how do you wanna play this? I'm thinking ""good pony/bad pony"". You yell and blast him with magic while my natural charisma will convince him that<U+0097> uh, Starlight?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Hey, Pharynx. I know when we first met, it didn't go so well."
Starlight Glimmer,"Right. [clears throat] So... not a big fan of the vines, huh?"
Pharynx,They're a safety hazard. An enemy could hide in them or use them as weapons. I don't even know why they're here.
Starlight Glimmer,Because they're pretty?
Pharynx,That's ridiculous.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, totally. We get you. But... [clears throat] maybe don't express how you feel by destroying them?"
Pharynx,"I don't take advice from ponies. The only thing I take from you is breakfast. At least, I used to."
Trixie,"You know, you're a lot like us!"
Pharynx,Doubt it.
Trixie,It's true. Do you know who Twilight Sparkle is?
Pharynx,No.
Trixie,"Well, she's the most well-liked, studious, do-goodiest pony in Equestria."
Pharynx,Ugh! She sounds awful.
Trixie,"Oh, you'd hate her. I used to. She made me unsure about my place in the world, which led me to act out against her."
Starlight Glimmer,And I used to be a dictator who ran a village with an iron hoof.
Pharynx,Really? Hmm. Maybe you two do understand me.
Starlight Glimmer,"Yes! We do! But now, Trixie has come to terms with being second-best, and I no longer control ponies against their will. And our lives are so much better for it."
Pharynx,"Wow. So you're both losers. Stay away from me, or I'll do to you what I did to the vines."
Thorax,"Well, ""Operation: Lead Maulwurf Away"" is coming along. How'd it go with Pharynx?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Your brother is, um, challenging."
Thorax,"Oh, that bad, huh?"
Starlight Glimmer,It wasn't great.
Thorax,You wanna talk it out? You can come with me to the feelings forum.
Trixie,The feel-like-what-now?
Thorax,"Oh, it's a place for changelings to express their feelings so we all gain a better understanding of each other. It's really helped bring the hive closer together."
Green Changeling,"Sometimes I feel like I'm a blue changeling. Sometimes I feel like I'm a purple changeling. But here I am, a green one."
Tymbal,You can be anything you want to be. Be blue one day and purple the next. Be both on the same day!
Green Changeling,But then I feel like I'd be living a lie.
Tymbal,It's very brave of you to share something so personal. Does anyone else have similar concerns?
Changeling 1,"I used to, but craft time has given me such a creative outlet, I feel great now!"
Changeling 2,Uh-huh. Everyone loves craft time.
Changeling 1,"Well, everyone except for... you-know-who."
Changeling 2,Yeah. You-know-who spends all his craft time making spears.
Changeling 1,He's scary and intimidating. You-know-who makes me uncomfortable.
Green Changeling,He makes us all uncomfortable.
Thorax,"Everyone, please! I understand Pharynx can be challenging at times."
Changeling 1,That's an understatement. He lined a hallway with thorns!
Green Changeling,He teaches little changelings to growl and hiss!
Changeling 3,My soup's too hot!
Changeling 3,What? I thought the feelings forum was for sharing our problems.
Pharynx,"It sounds like your lame ""feelings forum"" is for talking about me behind my back!"
Tymbal,"The feelings forum is for talking about anything that's bothering you. Is there something you'd like to share, Pharynx?"
Pharynx,"Actually, there is. The changelings used to be a fearsome swarm! Now we sit around talking about our feelings so much, you can't even stop a maulwurf from eating all your ""pretty plants""! I could've sent that thing packing before, but I guess now we'll just try to lead it away and hope that keeps us safe!"
Changeling 1,I don't feel safe with him around!
Green Changeling,I'd feel safer if he were gone!
Thorax,I can't do that.
Changeling 3,"[slurps] Hey, my soup's cooled down! These feeling forums are great for solving problems!"
Tymbal,"Everyone, please. If we are interrupting each other, we are not affirming each other."
Tymbal,That's it! Feelings forum is over!
Starlight Glimmer,"I... [sighs] I want to say something, but it goes against everything I've been taught as Twilight's pupil."
Trixie,"Ooh! Then, by all means, say it."
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] I think Pharynx is a lost cause.
Trixie,"Mm. I'm all for second chances. Third, even. But he just seems like a bad bug."
Starlight Glimmer,"And Thorax has a duty to the whole hive, not just his brother."
Trixie,"If he keeps sticking up for Pharynx, the hive might decide they don't want Thorax as their leader."
Starlight Glimmer,I think he might have to kick Pharynx out. But I don't wanna be the one to tell Thorax that.
Trixie,"Me, neither. But somepony probably should. I nominate you!"
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh!
Starlight Glimmer,"Thorax, we have something to tell you."
Thorax,"It's about Pharynx, isn't it?"
Trixie,[hesitating] Mmmmmmmaybe?
Thorax,"Look, I know he's an aggressive warrior type, but when I was little, every young changeling wanted to be like that."
Thorax,[voiceover] ...Every young changeling except me. The others would pick on me for not wanting to fight.
Young Changeling,Look at the little grub playing with his dollies!
Young Pharynx,Step away from my brother!
Thorax,[voiceover] But Pharynx never let them hurt me.
Young Changeling,We were just complimenting his dollies.
Young Thorax,"Thanks, Pharynx."
Young Pharynx,Why are you hitting yourself?! Stop hitting yourself! Why are you hitting yourself?!
Young Thorax,"Ouch! Cut it out, Pharynx!"
Young Pharynx,"They're right, you know. You need to have tougher skin."
Trixie,"Aw, that was a really sweet story. Until the end."
Thorax,"I know Pharynx loved me in his own way, and I know there's still good in him. That's why I keep sticking up for him. Anyway, what did you wanna talk to me about?"
Trixie,"Me? Oh, noooo. But, uh, Starlight has something she<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, Thorax, um, never mind! C'mon, Trixie, we've got a... thing to do."
Trixie,[whispering] What are you doing? I thought we agreed you'd tell Thorax he had to kick his brother out of the hive!
Starlight Glimmer,Maybe we don't have to. Get Pharynx and meet me at the hive entrance. I'll explain everything.
Trixie,And how am I supposed to know where Pharynx is?!
Passing Changeling,I just saw Pharynx.
Trixie,"Oh! Well, that was easy."
Trixie,Wow.
Starlight Glimmer,"I know, right? Great idea? Where's Pharynx?"
Trixie,He's gone.
Starlight Glimmer,Gone like gone to the throne room?
Trixie,Gone like gone! One of the changelings said Pharynx left the hive for good!
Starlight Glimmer,[gasp] Then who's gonna stop the dread maulwurf I'm leading here?!
Starlight Glimmer,"[panting] Thorax, there you are! Pharynx is missing!"
Trixie,Wait for it...
Starlight Glimmer,And the dread maulwurf is coming this way!
Trixie,Told ya.
Thorax,That doesn't make any sense. The trail of plants should have led the dread maulwurf away.
Starlight Glimmer,[nervous laugh] I might have relaid them to lead it back toward the hive.
Thorax,Why would you do that?!
Starlight Glimmer,"I thought if Pharynx saw you were in danger, the loving, caring side of him would come out when he protected you!"
Thorax,"But instead, he's out there alone somewhere between us and that rampaging monster?! I have to save him!"
Starlight Glimmer,I'm coming with you!
Thorax,Of course you are! This is all your fault!
Trixie,"[condescending] Oh, don't be too hard on Starlight. Her heart was in the right place."
Thorax,"You're coming, too!"
Trixie,"Oh. Right. I mean, I was gonna volunteer anyway..."
Thorax,Who else is coming?
Thorax,[groans] Fine.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, sure, you could all stay here, not help Pharynx and he won't bother you anymore. It's your choice. But remember when you didn't have a choice! When you were forced to obey Chrysalis! You might have been unstoppable, but you weren't free to choose! And now you are, because of Thorax! Well, it's his brother out there, and now it's your chance to prove you're just as strong embracing love as you were feeding on it! Now is your chance to show what changelings can really be! Not because you have to, but because you choose to!"
Trixie,"That was an amazingly epic speech, Starlight! I just can't believe not a single changeling was moved by it."
Thorax,"I can't blame them. If he wasn't my brother, I don't think I'd be here. We're gonna have to face the maulwurf by ourselves."
Starlight Glimmer,Maybe it'll be long gone and we'll find Pharynx out here alone!
Starlight Glimmer,Or maybe not.
Thorax,Pharynx!
Pharynx,What are you doing here?!
Thorax,I'm here to save you!
Pharynx,Get outta here! Let me handle this!
Starlight Glimmer,We're not leaving you!
Thorax,[nervous] I may have forgotten to mention in my letters that maulwurfs have really thick hides!
Starlight Glimmer,I thought you said you could beat this thing!
Pharynx,"Yeah, with the rest of the swarm! Not alone!"
Changeling 1,Good thing you're not alone!
Trixie,I told you it was an epic speech.
Thorax,It's no use! We're out of practice and he's too tough!
Trixie,And strong! Too bad we can't get it to fight itself!
Pharynx,"That's it! Thorax, remember when we were young and I made you hit yourself?"
Thorax,"Now is not the time to make fun of me, Pharynx!"
Thorax,"Oh, right! Of course!"
Pharynx,Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?!
Thorax,"Yeah, maulwurf, why are you hitting yourself?"
Thorax,"Why are you hitting yourself, huh? Huh? Huh?"
Trixie,"Ooh, that looks like it hurts."
Starlight Glimmer,We did it! It's gone!
Thorax,What were you doing out here?
Pharynx,Leaving. I'm done with all of you.
Thorax,"Oh. It's just, why bother fighting the maulwurf then? You coulda left it alone."
Pharynx,"Well, I couldn't just let it attack you!"
Thorax,"But I thought you were done with us, and you didn't care."
Pharynx,I never said that. The hive is the thing I care about most.
Thorax,"Well, you certainly don't act like it."
Pharynx,"Well, I'm sorry if I don't get excited about pretty flowers and feeling circles and<U+0097>"
Thorax,It's a feelings forum.
Pharynx,"Whatever. It doesn't matter. Even if I do care about the hive, I obviously don't have a place there anymore."
Changeling 1,"Actually, you do. Because we've been wrong. Um, the hive may be a gentler, nicer place..."
Changeling 2,...but that doesn't mean we won't have to defend ourselves. Clearly.
Thorax,And who better to help us do that than the only changeling who never stopped protecting us?
Pharynx,You all want me to stay?
Thorax,Unless you still want to leave the hive.
Pharynx,Why would I want that? I love the hive!
Trixie,He did it! He transformed!
Starlight Glimmer,I always knew you had it in you!
Pharynx,Really? Because I thought you said I was a lost cause and you were going to tell Thorax he should kick me out.
Trixie,Oh! Starlight! How could you say that?
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh! What?! That's<U+0097>! I mean<U+0097>! But you<U+0097>!
Thorax,"Lucky for us, you weren't a lost cause."
Pharynx,"Lucky for me, you didn't give up on me."
Trixie,Soooo... glad everything worked out.
Thorax,Yeah! Let's talk about how you not only led the maulwurf to the hive but also drove my brother away from it!
Pharynx,Hey. Do you guys want to hear the story about how I used to make Thorax hit himself?
Starlight Glimmer,"[relieved] Oh, absolutely, yes, right now!"
Newspaper Pony,"Morning, Pinkie Pie. Get your Ponyville Chronicle right here!"
Pinkie Pie,"Fan-tizzy-astic! I just love to read about happy happenings, and it's always good to be a pony in the know, you know? And there's so much to know!"
Rainbow Dash,"Eh, seems like a bunch of boring hooey to me."
Pinkie Pie,"Does ""New Shrubbery In Castle Garden"" sound like boring hooey to you?"
Rainbow Dash,Snooze.
Pinkie Pie,"What about... ""Parasprite Infestation In Fillydelphia Eradicated""? Ah! That's great news!"
Rainbow Dash,"Eh. Another day, another parasprite hype story."
Pinkie Pie,"[reading] ""Noodles Named Official Food Of Whinnyapolis"". ""Author A. K. Yearling Announces Retirement"". ""Cloudsdale Election Heating Up For Candidate In Favor Of Cooling It Down""."
Rainbow Dash,What?! Let me see that!
Pinkie Pie,"I never knew you were so into politics, Rainbow."
Rainbow Dash,"No, this! It can't be true..."
Pinkie Pie,"I'd have never have picked noodles as the official food of Whinnyapolis either, but here we are."
Rainbow Dash,"No, Pinkie! I can't believe that the greatest author and secret pony adventurer of all time, A. K. Yearling... is retiring!"
Pinkie Pie,"A. K. Yearling just retired. Like, today. Are you sure she wants visitors?"
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie, the A. K. Yearling I know would never quit and retire out of the blue! Something could be really wrong, and we need to make sure she's okay!"
Pinkie Pie,"Okay! Heeeey... You're not just trying to make sure she writes more Daring Do books, are you?"
Rainbow Dash,"Of course not! But that wouldn't hurt either. Now, come on!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, maybe she's not home. Maybe she went to the editor-in-chief of the Ponyville Chronicle to correct the misprint they've made."
Pinkie Pie,Nope. She's home.
Rainbow Dash,How do you know?
Pinkie Pie,Because she's right there looking all sad and alone.
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] I knew it! Something is wrong! [knocking rapidly] A. K!
Pinkie Pie,"Now she's sighing with the weight of the world. Now she's hanging her head in utter despair. Now she's shaking her hoof and cursing the heavens like nothing could ever possibly be the same again. Why, oh, why did this happen to her?!"
Rainbow Dash,What?!
Rainbow Dash,"A. K., it's us! Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie! Your friends!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, no. Did somepony ransack your cottage again and steal some ancient, mysterious relic that's the key to saving all of Equestria?!"
Pinkie Pie,Oooh! Sparky!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. [sighs] Nothing's been stolen.
Rainbow Dash,Then is somepony blackmailing you and forcing you to retire? Cause if they are...!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. No. Nothing like that.
Rainbow Dash,So you're just quitting and moving away? Why... would... you... do... that?!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. I already explained everything to the Ponyville Chronicle.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, really? [reading] ""Author A. K. Yearling announced yesterday that the next adventure novel in her popular series, 'Daring Do and the Curse of the Pharaoh's Tomb', will be her last. Yearling looks forward to her retirement."" That doesn't explain anything!"
Rainbow Dash,"It just says you're giving up writing stories. But most ponies don't know that you actually are Daring Do and that the stories are real. So what you're really saying is that you're giving up being Daring Do, but you're not saying why!"
Pinkie Pie,"Of course, if you don't feel like talking about it, that's A-okay, A. K.! As your friends, we completely understand. Right, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,Oh. Yeah. We just came to make sure you're all right. That's really why we wanted to find out what's going on.
A. K. Yearling,"A. K. If you really want to know... My last quest took me to a village in Southern Equestria, where I started seeing these."
Pinkie Pie,"[reading] ""Wake Of Destruction: Daring Do Ruins Entire Village Marketplace!"""
Rainbow Dash,"[reading] ""Dare Or Scare: Local Rogue Daring Do Involved In Frightful Fiasco""?"
Pinkie Pie,"[reading] ""Daring Do Leads Bull Into China Shop During High-Speed Chase<U+0097>"""
A. K. Yearling,A. K. That's enough! [sighs] Everypony I tried to help is mad at me.
Pinkie Pie,That's not true. They're not mad at A. K. Yearling. They're mad at Daring Do.
A. K. Yearling,"A. K. They don't sell my books in Southern Equestria. The ponies there don't know who A. K. Yearling is. They only know Daring Do, and apparently she does more harm than good."
Pinkie Pie,Then I guess it's a good thing you look so different as A. K. Yearling!
Rainbow Dash,So all we have to do is go down there and explain to these ponies that none of this stuff is true.
Pinkie Pie,Easy-peasy-cheesy!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. But that's just the thing <U+0096> it is true.
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie,What?!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. I guess I've always been so focused on saving priceless relics and stopping the bad guys that I never really thought about the mess I leave behind.
Pinkie Pie,Then you are in a tricky pickle. But why is all this happening now?
A. K. Yearling,"A. K. [sighs] I guess ponies are finally fed up. Either way, I'm done with adventures, having or writing."
Rainbow Dash,"Come on! For every one pony who's upset, there must be at least a hundred that know you're a hero!"
A. K. Yearling,"A. K. I don't think so, Dash."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, why don't we go visit this village ""Som...nam...bu...la"" and see for ourselves?"
A. K. Yearling,A. K. Those articles seem to make it pretty clear how the villagers feel.
Pinkie Pie,"But if we go there, the ponies can tell you in person just how much they appreciate you."
Rainbow Dash,And what a heap of rotten apple cores these articles are!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. You really think so?
Rainbow Dash,I know so! Let's go!
Rainbow Dash,[squealing] This is so cool! It looks just like that village in your last book where Daring Do recovers the Doomed Diadem from the Wild Bunch Gang who chase after her through the desert!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. It should. I based that entire chapter on my experiences here in Somnambula.
Pinkie Pie,"What happens? No, wait, don't tell me. I changed my mind! Tell me!"
Rainbow Dash,"Daring Do thwarts Ahuizotl's evil plot to separate the Sister Crown Relics. And if it wasn't for her, the region would be cursed with eternal night, and the entire town of Somnambula would have sunk into the ground!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ah, puh! There's no chance that these ponies don't think you're a hero."
Rainbow Dash,"Watch this. [to ""Cortland""] Hiya there, mister! I was hoping you could tell me about a pony named Daring Do. I hear she's an awesome adventure-pony hero."
Others,"""Cortland"": Daring Do? Oh, she's awesome, all right. Awesome at destroying ponies' apple carts..."
Others,"""Cortland"": ...and priceless, sacred statues!"
Dr. Caballeron,Dr. Indeed. Daring Do is a menace who destroys everything she touches!
Rainbow Dash,What?! No! Daring Do is the exact opposite of a menace!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. Ugh! I tried to tell you! Coming back here was a mistake!
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, A. K.! So we picked a bad example. That was just one angry pony."
Pinkie Pie,Two angry ponies!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. It doesn't matter! I never should have come with you! You two should just go home!
Rainbow Dash,Come on! We gotta follow her!
Pinkie Pie,I dunno. It really seemed like she doesn't want us cramping her saddle.
Rainbow Dash,"But we have to convince her that ponies do appreciate her! As her friend, I have to make sure she believes that."
Rainbow Dash,"Look, Pinkie! It's the Get On Inn! Daring Do stays here all the time in her adventures. Which means there must be ponies here who love Daring Do! Maybe they can help us."
Pinkie Pie,[sniffing] Mmmmm. My nose is telling me to help myself to muffins.
Rainbow Dash,Come on...
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, she's fancy. I got this. [to Mrs. Trotsworth] A good evening to you, madame. We are but weary travelers who humbly wish to inquire on the status of a certain mare of intrigue taking residence here."
Mrs. Trotsworth,Mrs. What in Southern Equestria are you on about?
Pinkie Pie,Is it true that Daring Do stays here?
Mrs. Trotsworth,"Mrs. Ha! Not anymore, she doesn't!"
Rainbow Dash,Why not?
Mrs. Trotsworth,"Mrs. The last time I rented that rascal a room, she was in such a rush to hightail it outta here, she didn't even pay her bill!"
Rainbow Dash,But<U+0097>
Mrs. Trotsworth,"Mrs. After that, a band of ruffians showed up and destroyed half the rooms looking for her. Guess she made them even more mad than she made me!"
Rainbow Dash,"No, no, no. You've got it all wrong."
Mrs. Trotsworth,Mrs. Hmph! How do you figure?
Rainbow Dash,Daring Do was trying to save everypony from the curse of the Doomed Diadem of Xilati. And she was only in a rush because she had to get the crown back to the Tiara of Teotlale before the curse took effect. [to Pinkie Pie] Chapter seventeen.
Mrs. Trotsworth,"Mrs. Sounds like a tall tale to me. And a hard one to believe, now that I know Daring Do is a scoundrel and a thief! Every year, ponies come to offer precious glowpaz to the Somnambula statue in the village in hopes for a good future. Why, that poor fella had his glowpaz necklace stolen by Daring Do just yesterday!"
Rainbow Dash,Hmmm...
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie,[gasps] There's A. K.!
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. Daring Do ruined our town and stole our precious glowpaz! We need to make sure that if she turns up again, there will be consequences! Everypony who's with me, meet at the statue tomorrow!"
A. K. Yearling,A. K. [sighs] Now I'm getting blamed for things I didn't even do? Why would I steal from them?
Rainbow Dash,"Listen, A. K. After a good night's sleep, we're going to fix all of this. I promise."
A. K. Yearling,"A. K. I shouldn't be here, Rainbow Dash. This is never gonna work."
Rainbow Dash,Of course it will! All I have to do is go up there and explain to everypony how wrong they all are.
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! And then I'll be like, ""What she said!"""
A. K. Yearling,A. K. [sighs] Easy-peasy-cheesy...
Pinkie Pie,Exactly!
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. Here it is! The remains of your<U+0096> I mean, our Somnambula statue! Now that Daring Do has destroyed it, tell me, where will we hang our glowpaz?"
Random Villager,We don't even have any glowpaz because they were stolen by Daring Do!
Rainbow Dash,"Daring Do would never steal anything! And okay, she destroyed your statue, but it was because she was trying to save you all from Ahuizotl!"
Rainbow Dash,Ahuizotl? He's about yea big? Long neck? Itty-bitty face? Weird claw thingy on his tail?
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! Ooh! I know him! He's a baddie!
Rainbow Dash,"Trust me, if Ahuizotl had gotten away with the Doomed Diadem, your entire village would have been swallowed up! And that's a lot worse than losing some crummy old statue!"
Others,"""Cortland"": Ahem! This was not some crummy old statue! It was the namesake of our town! If you want to understand us, you must first understand her."
Rainbow Dash,Who?
Others,"""Cortland"": Somnambula. Long ago..."
Others,"""Cortland"": [narrating] ...this village fell prey to an evil Sphinx who demanded most of their crops. Like her fellow villagers, Somnambula didn't have much, but she used what she had to keep others from giving up hope. The son of the Pharaoh, Prince Hisan, was so moved by her compassion that he decreed nopony would go hungry again. But when Hisan stood up to the Sphinx, the beast captured him, telling the Pharaoh the only way to get Hisan back was to solve her riddle. Nopony would volunteer to save the prince. Nopony except Somnambula."
Others,"""Cortland"": [narrating] The Sphinx gave her the riddle. ""I shine brightest in the dark. I am there but cannot be seen. To have me costs you nothing. To be without me costs you everything."" As Somnambula thought of the hardship she and her fellow villagers had experienced, she instantly knew the answer. ""Hope!"", she shouted."
Others,"""Cortland"": [narrating] The Sphinx was so enraged, it seemed she might still refuse to release the prince, so Somnambula asked her for one more challenge. But if she accomplished it, the Sphinx would leave from the kingdom forever. The Sphinx quickly agreed, asking only that Somnambula walk to the prince across a deep chasm... blindfolded! Further, the Sphinx had cast a powerful spell that prevented Somnambula from flying."
Others,"""Cortland"": [narrating] But Somnambula never lost hope! She knew she'd need to make a leap of faith to save the prince. Guided by the sound of the prince's voice... she easily made it across."
Others,"""Cortland"": [narrating] The Pharaoh asked how Somnambula prevailed, and she explained that she had always hoped she could make things better for her people and that hope had carried her through. The Prince replaced the pearls Somnambula gave up with a string of glowpaz. And around her neck, they glowed bright enough to light the entire kingdom."
Others,"""Cortland"": Forever after, glowpaz became our symbol of hope."
Rainbow Dash,"Wow. I had no idea how special the statue was to you. Somnambula sounds like a pretty cool pony. But I bet if she were here, she'd tell you how cool Daring Do is too, because they've both fought to protect this town!"
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. If Somnambula were here today, she would condemn Daring Do for destroying your<U+0096> our symbol of hope!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, buddy! What did Daring Do ever do to you to deserve all this?!"
Dr. Caballeron,Dr. Only... everything!
Rainbow Dash,Dr. Caballeron?!
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. Yes... Rainbow Dash. [laughing evilly] When I saw you, her closest friend, I knew that Daring Do would not be far behind. I really do owe you for leading her right to me."
Rainbow Dash,But I-I didn't mean to<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,Help!
A. K. Yearling,A. K. Caballeron?! No!
Pinkie Pie,He's got Rainbow Dash! Come on!
Pinkie Pie,[panting] I'm... coming... Rainbow... Dash... [to Daring Do] Ah! I knew you'd come!
Daring Do,You did? I sure didn't. What if I cause more trouble?
Pinkie Pie,You won't.
Daring Do,How do you know?
Pinkie Pie,I just do! You wouldn't let anything happen to Rainbow Dash. You care too much.
Daring Do,You're right. Which way did they go? To the pyramid!
Rainbow Dash,Somepony help! Somepony! Anypony! Pinkie Pie?! Daring Do?! Is that you?!
Pinkie Pie,"Don't worry, Rainbow! We'll save you!"
Daring Do,[grunting] He's right! We'll never get to her in time!
Pinkie Pie,"If this really is like Somnambula's story, then we just have to have hope that we can."
Daring Do,"I think we need more than hope, Pinkie. There was a bridge in the story, and there's no bridge here. What are we going to do?"
Daring Do,Pinkie!
Daring Do,Aha!
Pinkie Pie,Wheeee! [giggles] I knew we'd do it!
Daring Do,"Thanks for reminding me to never give up hope, Pinkie."
Rainbow Dash,"And I'm kinda ""hoping"" you ponies will untie me before we all take a bath in bubbling green slime!"
Daring Do,We're on it!
Daring Do,"Not so fast, Caballeron!"
Others,"""Nile Faras"": You stole our glowpaz!"
Daring Do,I should have known you were just trying to sully my name so that you'd be free to steal whatever you wanted.
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. And with the destruction you leave in your wake, it didn't take too much to convince ponies you were a villain!"
Daring Do,"You're wrong, Caballeron. And I won't let you break my spirit again. Because I'm never going to give up hope that I can protect ponies and ancient treasures from miscreants like you!"
Dr. Caballeron,"Dr. R-Remember! She ruined your statue! You're fools to believe in her! [growls] You'll pay for this, Daring Do!"
Daring Do,"Okay, okay, that's enough. [to Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie] Thanks for helping me come to my senses. You two are true friends."
Rainbow Dash,Are you kidding? That... was... awesome!
Pinkie Pie,We're just glad you're back to your old self again.
Daring Do,"[chuckles] Me too. But I'm glad I realized that even if you're fighting for something good, you're still responsible for your actions."
Rainbow Dash,"And if something bad happens that you didn't intend, you shouldn't give up hope or lose faith in yourself."
Pinkie Pie,Yeah! All you gotta do is make it right. Feel free to use that in your next book!
Daring Do,"You know, I think I will."
Filthy Rich,Hmph! Looks like I'm not the only one who left Mares Day to the last minute.
Sweetie Drops,There's just so many! How can I choose?!
Rose,"Now, hang on, everypony! We'll help all of you!"
Sweetie Drops,How?!
Rarity,What I would do...
Rarity,...is pick flowers that accentuate my mane. It makes for a captivating color story when you present them to whomever they're intended.
Lily Valley,That's it!
Rose,"Color consultations was a great idea, Rarity! Now, what can we do for you?"
Rarity,"Oh, darling, I need a dozen lavender pieces for Photo Finish's shoot on the most beautiful manes in Equestria."
Rarity,"I know you're swamped, but it's for Vanity Mare! She's going to take pictures of my mane, so color coordination is a must."
Rose,"Anything for you, Rarity."
Rarity,"Have you a single big one? If the wind came from one direction, it would really intensify the effect."
Mr. Breezy,"Mr. I don't. Uh, but I could make you one! It's not like I've got anything else to do."
Rarity,"Hmm. I do enjoy the windswept look, but other ponies might need to see it before they feel it."
Others,"""Chelsea Porcelain"": Oh, if these came in different colors, I'd buy one for every room."
Davenport,Hmm... Sales have been down. More colors it is!
Rarity,"Pinkie? I need to put Photo Finish in a good mood, and nothing creates a better mood than your confecti<U+0097> Ooh. Am I interrupting?"
Pinkie Pie,We were just celebrating the anniversary of the twins' first sneezes! [giggles] [clears throat] Just about one year ago There was a tickle in your nose You snorted through the nursery [snorts] Happy Sneeze-iversary!
Others,Achoo! Achoo! Aaaaa-choo!
Rarity,[deadpan] Congratulations.
Rarity,[shrieks] Pinkie! I can't have Photo Finish shoot my mane like this! And this party string won't come off!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, that's because it's not just party string. It's super-sticky celebration string!"
Rarity,"[shuddering sigh] It'll be fine, Pinkie. I'll find a way to clean this up before the shoot tomorrow. [whimper] Actually, you might consider doing the same."
Pinkie Pie,"[grunting, straining] If only we had some kind of super-sudsy mane conditioning shampoo for you and a magical cleaning remover potion for me."
Rarity,[gasps] That's it! We'll pay a visit to Zecora! She's a wonder with a cauldron. I'm sure she can mix up a fix for both of us.
Pinkie Pie,"That's good, because it would take forever to yank all of those baked goods out of the super-sticky celebration string."
Rarity,I... think you may still have some baking to do.
Rarity,I do wish Zecora lived in town. One shouldn't have to brave the darkest part of the forest for shampoo.
Pinkie Pie,Do you think Photo Finish would want to take a picture of my mane?
Rarity,"Well, uh... Hmm...I'm not sure that your style is quite right for this particular photo essay. Photo Finish travelled everywhere in her search for the most beautiful of manes."
Pinkie Pie,Even Yakyakistan?
Rarity,"Well, yaks don't have manes, per se, and I'm not sure their style is quite what she's looking for either."
Rarity,"Though at this moment, neither is mine."
Pinkie Pie,Don't worry! Zecora will abso-tively be able to help!
Rarity,I'm sure you're right.
Rarity,"Listen, spooky eyes! Why don't you take a picture?! It will last longer!"
Rarity,"On second thought, don't. Getting my picture taken in this state is what I'm trying to avoid!"
Rarity,Are you certain that's safe?
Zecora,"I'm sure they seem strange, but my methods are mine. After all, I've been doing this for quite a long time."
Pinkie Pie,I'll have those cupcakes cleaned off in no time!
Rarity,You really should bake new ones.
Pinkie Pie,Nah!
Zecora,"For your mane, of course, just soap will do, so use my super-sudsy shampoo."
Zecora,"You were right to be concerned. Manes are tricky, I have learned."
Rarity,Oh! [scoffs] Tell me about it!
Zecora,"Cleaning is simple, but a magical fix could cause any number of troublesome ticks."
Pinkie Pie,Really?
Zecora,"Oh, there are tales I could tell to make your hair stand on end. Horrifying, terrifying attempts to mane-mend!"
Rarity,"Well, I do enjoy a good yarn, but I'm not sure I could take anymore mane fright today."
Zecora,"There's the contagious frizz that spreads friend to friend, or the story of the infinitely splitting end!"
Rarity,"Uh-huh, hmm, yes, well, very entertaining. Uh, thanks for the shampoo. Ta-ta!"
Pinkie Pie,Anything about curls that keep on curling until your whole body is one big curl?
Zecora,[laughs] There is one story I nearly forgot: of an Earth pony who needed to clean up her shop.
Pinkie Pie,"Wow! That's just what I have to do! Huh, weird."
Zecora,Perhaps it'd be better if I were more clear. You can't clean up Sugarcube Corner from here.
Pinkie Pie,"Geez, Zecora, I can take a hint."
Zecora,"With just a few drops, any mess you'll improve if you focus on that which you want to remove."
Pinkie Pie,It won't be hard to focus on the super-sticky celebration string. It's kinda the only thing you can see.
Pinkie Pie,"Zecora says it would only take a few drops, but I figured we should all chip in. Just in case! Remember to only focus on the party string. We don't wanna accidentally remove anything else."
Rarity,"It's important that you know that I am not pointing hooves, but<U+0097>"
Zecora,"I don't understand. Is that you, Rarity? Why would you think to point your hooves at me?"
Rarity,Let's just say I understand why your shampoo hasn't made a splash in the marketplace.
Rarity,"Goodness, Zecora! You could at least pretend it isn't that bad!"
Zecora,"I'm sorry, my dear, but there is nothing to say. You just took the wrong potion from here yesterday."
Rarity,"Oh, thank goodness! I thought maybe your shampoo had triggered early-onset mare pattern baldness!"
Zecora,"No, this lack of hair was put into motion when you mistakenly washed with remover potion."
Rarity,"[laughing] Oh, what a relief! Well, if you could just whip up a cure, I'll be on my way. So much to do before the shoot tomorrow."
Zecora,"As I mentioned before, there's no easy fix. Mane-mending magic's the trickiest of tricks."
Rarity,[mumbling] Sorry?
Zecora,"I doubt that your mane has left us forever. There is a chance we can fix it, I think, if we're clever."
Rarity,"W-w-w-w-w-w-wait, there's, there's a chance?! You think?!"
Zecora,I need to focus if I'm to work any faster. One wrong ingredient spells utter disaster. You should go finish your list of to-dos. Keep your mind off of all of these mane-losing blues.
Rarity,[exhales] There's nothing to worry about. Zecora will have a cure before I've even finished my to-dos. But I don't know if I can even show my face looking like this!
Rose,"I'm sorry, miss, but I can't match your mane if I can't see it."
Golden Harvest,What about mine?
Rose,"Marigold, I should think!"
Rarity,"Uh, sorry. I, uh, believe it was my turn, and I-I-I-I just need to pick up some<U+0097>"
Golden Harvest,Perfect!
Merry May,Now me!
Customer Pony,It's wonderful how this display shows that your fans provide just the right amount of air!
Mr. Breezy,"Mr. Well, I owe it all to Rarity."
Rarity,"Oh, so kind of you to say. I-I<U+0097>"
Mr. Breezy,Mr. Kindness has nothing to do with it! Rarity always knows how to make something look its best. Probably because she looks so good herself! That ain't something us non-fabulous folk here can understand.
Rarity,N-Non-fabulous?!
Davenport,"Now I appreciate everypony's interest in our new sofa colors, but the yellow one is spoken for."
Rarity,"Oh, thank you, Davenport. Um, perhaps I can pick it up once everypony leav<U+0097>"
Berryshine,I'll give you twice whatever the pony who wants to buy the yellow one is paying!
Sprinkle Medley,Three times!
Rarity,But<U+0097> But<U+0097> I<U+0097> I<U+0097>
Davenport,Sold!
Rarity,I can't believe how differently ponies treat you when you can't command their attention.
Twilight Sparkle,Are you sure that's what happened?
Starlight Glimmer,Wait. You can't command ponies' attention because your mane's messed up?
Rarity,"""Messed up""? Does this look ""messed up"" to you?!"
Rarity,Honestly! How hard is it to pretend it's not so bad?
Starlight Glimmer,Hard.
Rarity,"If today is any indication of how ponies will treat me from now on, I can't simply wait to see if my mane grows back!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Rarity. I'm sure nopony means to make you feel worse than you already do."
Starlight Glimmer,Didn't you say Zecora was working on a cure?
Rarity,"Yes, well, even if everypony isn't utterly indifferent to my presence, Zecora might not be able to fix this in time for the shoot. Can't you do a spell to restore some semblance of my mane?!"
Starlight Glimmer,"The thing is, it's pretty much like Zecora said. Fixing manes with magic is<U+0097>"
Rarity,Tricky! I know! I don't care! Make with the tricks!
Starlight Glimmer,Huh?
Rarity,This won't do! I need an actual mane!
Starlight Glimmer,But it has to come from somewhere.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, you can't just make a mane with magic. The results could be disastrous."
Rarity,More disastrous than this?!
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] I don't think there's anything else we can try.
Rarity,[panicked stuttering] B-But Zecora said there was still a chance!
Zecora,"At last, Rarity, I have searched for so long! What I told you before was totally wrong!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Zecora, you found a cure? That's amazing!"
Rarity,[sighs in relief] You mean I'll get my fabulous mane back in time for the shoot?
Zecora,"Oh, no. I'm afraid I can't fix it before the big shoot. But in time, the hair will grow back from the root. There's no magical cure to hasten us through it, unless you went backward in time to undo it."
Starlight Glimmer,Uh-uh. I think we can both say that's not a good option.
Rarity,I have always believed that the right outfit can make up for any other areas that are lacking. But I will need your honest opinions. [nervous ta-da] How awful is it?
Others,"Applejack, [simultaneously] Uhhh..."
Rarity,"Oh, come on! Can't anypony pretend it's not bad?!"
Fluttershy,"We could, um, try."
Rainbow Dash,Maybe...?
Rarity,"Well, if any of you have an idea how to make this disaster look good enough for Photo Finish's piece in Vanity Mare on the most beautiful manes in Equestria, [sobbing] I'm open to hearing it!"
Applejack,Is that all?
Rainbow Dash,No problem!
Rarity,Hm?
Rarity,"I don't understand, Applejack. How is milking a cow going to help?"
Applejack,That's just it. It looks like we hired a new milkmaid...
Granny Smith,This is pretty close to my color as a young'un!
Applejack,Just a little down-home ingenuity.
Rarity,"It's a good idea, Applejack, but Photo Finish is looking for the most beautiful manes, not bonnets."
Rainbow Dash,This'll do the trick. Just you wait!
Rarity,"[gasps] You know, this is really quite fetching!"
Rainbow Dash,Yes! Nailed it!
Rarity,...Just not portable.
Fluttershy,There!
Rarity,"Oh, let's face it. I'll just have to call Photo Finish and cancel."
Twilight Sparkle,"I think we all know how bad Rarity's been feeling, but I never thought she'd cancel her shoot with Photo Finish."
Rainbow Dash,"You saw her mane, right?"
Applejack,"But it's Rarity. If anypony can turn lemons into lemonade, it's her."
Fluttershy,I guess it's harder for her when she feels like the lemon.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, she's not a lemon <U+0096> she's our friend. And right now, she needs our support."
Rarity,[muffled] Come in.
Rarity,Would you mind closing the door? I'm more comfortable in the dark.
Applejack,"Okay, Rarity, you've done just about enough sulkin'! Havin' a fabulous mane is a wonderful thing, but it ain't the only thing!"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! And we're here to remind you how awesome you are, mane or no mane!"
Rarity,"[sighs] It's lovely of you to say, but it's hard to argue with cold, hard facts."
Fluttershy,What facts are those?
Rarity,"That without my mane, I simply can't shine as I once did, and ponies treat me like the sad, invisible pony I've become."
Twilight Sparkle,"Rarity, you're not invisible. You're our friend. A friend that started a fashion empire."
Fluttershy,A friend who made us all feel beautiful in her lovely creations.
Rainbow Dash,"A friend who stuck by us, no matter what!"
Applejack,A friend so generous that she once chopped off her own tail to help a sea serpent.
Twilight Sparkle,"I know you lost some confidence when you lost your mane, but unlike your hair, confidence is something you can get back right now."
Rarity,"Goodness... You're right! The only pony behaving differently today was me! Besides, what doesn't shine from the outside in..."
Starlight Glimmer,"Um, Rarity, what are you doing?"
Rarity,I'm preparing to shine from the inside out!
Rainbow Dash,Awesome!
Filthy Rich,It's my own fault. I shouldn't have bought flowers without asking Spoiled what she likes.
Rose,"Well, we don't have much left. What does she like?"
Filthy Rich,"Um, uh... purple?"
Rarity,I have a solution!
Rose,"Rarity, that mane is..."
Daisy and Lily Valley,Amazing!
Rarity,"Thank you. Although I'm afraid I missed my chance at Vanity Mare, which means I have quite a few lavender arrangements to spare."
Filthy Rich,"Uh, is lavender purple?"
Rarity,Mm... The windswept look is very last-season. Perhaps you could set this up outside. It's sure to draw in the hoof traffic.
Stallion,Ahhh!
Rarity,"Photoshoot or no, you can always use a chaise!"
Applejack,"Well, Rarity, if you wanted to shine from the inside out, I think this afternoon, you became the brightest filly in Equestria!"
Rarity,"Oh, pshaw, Applejack. I'm simply making up for all the time I wasted feeling sorry for myself."
Rainbow Dash,I don't know why you were so upset. Your mane looks awesome!
Rarity,"I'm just glad I have all of you to remind me that even if I accidentally use magical remover potion on my mane, I can look good on the outside as long as I feel good on the inside."
Twilight Sparkle,"How'd you end up using remover potion on your head, anyway?"
Rarity,[gasps] Pinkie!
Rarity,"If I had the remover potion this whole time, that means Pinkie must have the<U+0097>"
Rarity,...shampoo.
Pinkie Pie,Shampoo? Wow! That explains why our manes are all so bouncy and soft!
Rarity,"Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the rest of that remover potion."
Pinkie Pie,"Great! Hey, is there something different about you? New hoof polish?"
Rarity,So you're sure? You're sure it's fully recovered?
Applejack,"Yes, Rarity. It's been months. Your mane looks fine."
Pinkie Pie,"Oooh, look! It's the ""Most Beautiful Manes in Equestria"" issue of Vanity Mare! You should read it."
Rarity,"Oh, honestly, Pinkie? After all I went through, I'm not sure it even matters what mane graces the page<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,Read it!
Rarity,But I... I cancelled the shoot.
Applejack,We had a little talk with Photo Finish.
Fluttershy,And explained just how beautiful we thought you were. Inside and out.
Rainbow Dash,"While you were shining from the inside out, Photo Finish took a few pictures."
Rarity,I don't know what to say!
Applejack,"Luckily, you don't have to say anything. Your style speaks for itself."
Fluttershy,"Thank you so much, Zecora. I never would've found the crisscross moss without you."
Zecora,"Of course. I know where it grows, so it's not much to ask. Though retrieving it has been a difficult task."
Fluttershy,"Oh, but the oxen visiting Sweet Feather Sanctuary next week will surely appreciate it. It really adds a shine to their coat."
Zecora,"There we go. Now, that wasn't so tough. Fluttershy, tell me, will this be enough?"
Fluttershy,"Gee, I don't know. It's a pretty big pack. So maybe enough to fill up this sack? [gasps, laughs] Oh, my! You're rubbing off on me, Zecora!"
Zecora,Whoa. Whoa!
Fluttershy,"[screams] Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!"
Fluttershy,"Zecora, are you all right?"
Zecora,No need to fret. I only got wet. At least now I can easily grab all the crisscross moss there is to be had.
Fluttershy,[gasps] What's happening to you?
Zecora,"Honestly, it's hard to tell. But suddenly, I don't feel so well..."
Dr. Horse,"Dr. All right, Zecora. Let's have a listen to the old ticker."
Dr. Horse,Dr. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
Fluttershy,"Do you think it's serious, doctor?"
Dr. Horse,"Dr. Well, that wasn't a good sign."
Fluttershy,I can't believe a flower did this. I take back thinking it was pretty!
Dr. Horse,Dr. Mm-hmm. We're looking for any color other than red.
Dr. Horse,"Dr. Oh, it's just as I thought. I'm afraid you have a very rare disease called... [echoing] Swamp Fever!"
Zecora,"Tell me, doctor. What should I do? I've never heard of Swamp Fever, mind you."
Dr. Horse,"Dr. Unfortunately, very little is known about the disease. Except, of course, its symptoms <U+0096> change of coat, coughing bubbles, shock sneezing, confusion, and the last stage, the afflicted turn into the very trees that drop the disease-spreading flower."
Zecora,Oh! Is there anything that can be done for such a terrible conundrum?!
Dr. Horse,"Dr. A cure has yet to be discovered. I'm sorry, Zecora."
Zecora,Hmmm.
Dr. Horse,Dr. It's a lot to take in. I'll leave you two to discuss.
Fluttershy,"Zecora, this is all my fault! If you hadn't been helping me get the crisscross moss, you wouldn't have gotten Swamp Fever. I'm so sorry."
Zecora,"Fluttershy, you are not to blame. These things happen all the same."
Fluttershy,I refuse to accept that! There has to be somepony who can help you!
Zecora,"Oh. There's a healer of legend who never would fail. But I only know her from ancient folktales. Mystical and masked, she came in the night and cured everything from hoof cough to fur blight. What became of the healer, nopony knows, for she disappeared ages and ages ago."
Fluttershy,The Mystical Mask! Of course! My parents would tell me about her whenever I was sick in bed.
Zecora,There's so many accounts of her power to heal. She can't just be a legend. I think she's real.
Fluttershy,"If that's who we need to cure you, then I'm going to find her! And I know just the pony who can help!"
Fluttershy,[pants] Oh.
Fluttershy,"Twilight? Twilight? Twilight! Oh, I'm so sorry to bother<U+0097> Are... Are you cooking?"
Twilight Sparkle,Yeah! Spike and I are having a cook-off!
Spike,My cauliflower bites blew her sweet potato muffins out of the water!
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm glad you're here, Fluttershy, because we're gonna need a second opinion about that."
Fluttershy,"[grunts, gulps, grunts, gulps] Um, they're both delicious, but... [quickly] Zecora-has-Swamp-Fever-and-there's-no-cure-and-it's-all-my-fault-and-the-only-pony-who-can-cure-it-is-the-Mystical-Mask-and-I-need-your-help-to-find-her!"
Twilight Sparkle,Uh...
Spike,"So, what'd she pick? The cauliflower bites, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] That's the last book on ancient ponies, and still no mention of the Mystical Mask."
Fluttershy,Hmm. Did we check the unabridged versions?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, and the books on rare diseases, the books on rare plants, and the entire section on bog habitation."
Fluttershy,"Well, we might have to look through every book in the entire library, but I know we'll figure it out."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh.
Fluttershy,"[sighs] Another dead end. Have you found anything yet, Twilight?"
Fluttershy,Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,Aah!
Fluttershy,Goodness! Are you okay?
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] I'm fine. Fluttershy, you know that I want to help Zecora. But I think we'd be a lot better off if we got some sleep. We've been at this for hours."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how late it had gotten."
Twilight Sparkle,No problem. I'll grab you a pillow and<U+0097>
Fluttershy,"Oh, no-no-no. I meant you should sleep. I can't rest until Zecora is healed."
Twilight Sparkle,"I understand how you feel, but I still think we'd have more luck if we tried again in the morning. Just promise me you'll take a break soon."
Fluttershy,[not listening] Mm-hmm.
Twilight Sparkle,"[yawns] Good night, Fluttershy."
Twilight Sparkle,[snoring] 9-by-13-inch pan...
Fluttershy,Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,[awake] Nonstick pans!
Spike,"[groans] What's all the commotion in here, ladies?"
Fluttershy,"Sorry, but I figured out who the Mystical Mask is!"
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] You did?!
Fluttershy,"All I had to do was cross-reference a book about masks with another book on ancient Equestrian healers, then use a third book to translate it all from Olde Ponish, and there it was! Zecora was right! The Mystical Mask wasn't just a legend. The Mystical Mask was Mage Meadowbrook!"
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps deeply] The ancient sorceress from Hayseed Swamp? We studied her at Celestia's school! Are you sure?
Fluttershy,"Absolutely! Mage Meadowbrook wasn't just a sorceress. She was also a healer, and back then, healers wore masks so they wouldn't get sick themselves!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, I am so incredibly proud of you for using your research skills to figure this out! But Meadowbrook lived ages ago, and didn't she disappear?"
Fluttershy,"Mm-hmm. But if we go to Hayseed Swamp, maybe we can find something she left behind! Something that could lead to a cure!"
Twilight Sparkle,"It seems like a long shot, but I guess it's possible."
Fluttershy,"[grunting] We have to try! I've got a route all planned out, and on the way, we can check up on Zecora, and then<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're leaving now?"
Fluttershy,Of course! Every second we spend waiting is a second Zecora is coughing bubbles!
Twilight Sparkle,"But Fluttershy, you haven't slept! And that's a long journey!"
Fluttershy,"There's no use trying to talk me out of this, Twilight! [grunts] We've got no time to waste!"
Twilight Sparkle,Can we at least grab some breakfast?
Fluttershy,I packed cauliflower bites.
Twilight Sparkle,Aw. No sweet potato muffins?
Fluttershy,And that's when I realized the Mystical Mask was actually Mage Meadowbrook!
Zecora,"[coughs] That's marvelous, Fluttershy. I am quite impressed. While you are gone on your journey, I'll try not to be... worried."
Fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, no. Zecora, you didn't rhyme! You must be getting worse."
Fluttershy,[gasps] That's it! We have to go now!
Twilight Sparkle,"Lead the way, Fluttershy."
Twilight Sparkle,So... [chuckles nervously] where do you think Meadowbrook lived?
Fluttershy,[yawns] I'm not sure. Maybe there's somepony we can ask.
Twilight Sparkle,I think we might be the only ponies here.
Fluttershy,Wait! I recognize that tree! [gasps] Yes! This has to be it! It's just like the illustrations of her home!
Twilight Sparkle,Anypony who lives in a tree is okay by me.
Twilight Sparkle,Or we could try the handle.
Fluttershy,[laughs nervously] It really blends in with the bark.
Twilight Sparkle,Easy to miss.
Fluttershy,"Wow. It looks like this place has been abandoned for years. [gasps] Twilight, look! It's the same kind of lilypad that gave Zecora Swamp Fever! Hmm. I wonder if Meadowbrook was looking for a cure for Swamp Fever, too. [gasps] Do you think she found it?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I hope so, but let's not get ahead of ourselves."
Twilight Sparkle,That's exactly what I'm talking about. You're making your excited squeaking noise!
Fluttershy,"Uh, I wasn't making my excited squeaking noise."
Cattail,[Cajun accent] Y'all can stop screamin' now. Didn't mean to scare ya. I do that a lot.
Twilight Sparkle,Scare ponies or rock creepily in the dark?
Cattail,"Well, both, I s'pose. Name's Cattail. Pleased to meet ya."
Fluttershy,"Likewise, but, um, may I ask, why are you in Mage Meadowbrook's home?"
Cattail,"Oh, I take care of the place. I ain't much of a cleaner, but from what I hear, my kin wasn't neither. So I doubt they'd mind a few cobwebs in our ancestral home."
Fluttershy,[gasps] You're related to Mage Meadowbrook?
Cattail,Mm-hmm.
Fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness, Twilight, we did it! Not only did we find Mage Meadowbrook's old house <U+0096> we actually found one of her descendants!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Honestly, I would not have guessed it."
Cattail,"So you're lookin' for some kind o' cure, huh? Well, now, I know Meadowbrook was known to always be writin' in her journals. If she had the cure you want, I reckon that's where it'd be. Come on. I'll show ya the library."
Twilight Sparkle,Library?! Now we're talkin'!
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. Well... [chuckles] Libraries come in all shapes and sizes.
Fluttershy,This is good. It'll take us less time to go through everything.
Fluttershy,"[blows air, reading] ""Today, my mom made me eat peas. Peas are yucky."" And we can probably skip this one, unless she found a cure when she was a foal."
Fluttershy,"Wait! Listen to this! [reading] ""Today, I tried again to brew an unsniffle elixir..."""
Fluttershy and Mage Meadowbrook,[crossfading] [Cajun accent] ...and I finally got it right!
Meadowbrook's Mother,"Meadowbrook' Meadowbrook, I think it's time you had this."
Mage Meadowbrook,"[gasps] My very own healer's mask! You think I'm ready, mother?"
Meadowbrook's Mother,Meadowbrook' Mm-hm.
Meadowbrook's Mother,Meadowbrook' [gasps] What caused this?
Mage Meadowbrook,"[narrating] Mother calls it Swamp Fever. We've been tryin' to find a cure, but it hasn't been easy."
Mage Meadowbrook,[narrating] The fever spread like wildfire.
Mage Meadowbrook,"[narrating] I fear if we don't find a cure soon, everypony will be in grave danger!"
Mage Meadowbrook,"[narrating] With mother sick, I didn't think I'd ever find a cure. But starin' at those cursed flowers today, I saw somethin'."
Mage Meadowbrook,"[gasps] Flash bees! [narrating] I realized the flowers' poison didn't affect the flash bees. And if they were immune to Swamp Fever, their honey could be the cure!"
Mage Meadowbrook,"[narrating] But they were so aggressive defendin' their hive, I didn't know how I was gonna get it!"
Mage Meadowbrook,Here goes nothin'!
Mage Meadowbrook,"[narrating] Today, I cured mother..."
Fluttershy and Mage Meadowbrook,[crossfading] ...and the rest of the bayou!
Fluttershy,"[reading] ""It was the greatest feeling I've ever experienced, and I promise to dedicate my life to curing ponies all over Equestria!"""
Cattail,And she did just that. Right up 'til she disappeared without a trace.
Fluttershy,"So all we have to do is find those aggressive flash bees and get them to give us their honey! Of course, it doesn't say how she did that..."
Fluttershy,"What? Is my mane messy? I know I haven't slept in a while, but... [gasps] Oh, no! I've caught Swamp Fever!"
Fluttershy,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,[slightly muffled] Are you sure these are necessary?
Fluttershy,What?
Twilight Sparkle,"I said, are you sure these are necessary?"
Fluttershy,Yes! I won't risk infecting you or Cattail!
Twilight Sparkle,"What you can't risk is getting any sicker! If you don't rest, your symptoms will only get worse!"
Cattail,Mm-hmm. You really should rest up before going up against those flash bees. They are nasty critters.
Fluttershy,"Um, you don't know this about me, but I'm pretty good with animals. And besides, Dogtail<U+0097>"
Cattail,Cattail.
Fluttershy,"Um, Zecora is counting on me. I have to help her, just like Meadowbrook helped her mother and all those bayou ponies long ago!"
Twilight Sparkle,"But Fluttershy, as much as Meadowbrook took care of other ponies, I'm sure she also took care of herself."
Fluttershy,"[strained] You're not gonna change my mind, Twilight!"
Cattail,"Ooh. For bein' sick, she sure is strong."
Cattail,The flash beehive is just up yonder.
Twilight Sparkle,Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Fluttershy,"Hello, flash bees! I was hoping I could get some of your honey."
Fluttershy,"Oh! I see. You don't let others have any. Well, I'm sorry, but I really need it."
Fluttershy,"[squeaks] I didn't want it to have to come to this, but I'll just have to use... the Stare!"
Fluttershy,[groans] What happened? Where am I?
Twilight Sparkle,[exhales] I'm so glad you're okay. You're still in Meadowbrook's tree.
Cattail,"You fainted, but Twilight shot some magic up and caught ya. It was crazy."
Fluttershy,Goodness gracious! [coughs] Have you heard from Zecora? Is she okay?
Twilight Sparkle,Uh...
Cattail,We got word your zebra friend has started sproutin' leaves.
Fluttershy,She's already turning into a tree?! I thought we'd have more time!
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, you've been asleep for three days."
Fluttershy,Three days?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Mm-hmm. You were asleep so long, we were afraid you wouldn't be able to move when you woke up. But thankfully, you just wore yourself down!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, dear. We have to get back to the hive! I've wasted so much time, and<U+0097>!"
Cattail,"Now hang on there, Fluttershy. Those flash bee critters are tricky."
Twilight Sparkle,Cattail's right. I can't even use magic to calm them down. We'll have to find another way to get the honey.
Twilight Sparkle,He's been through a lot these past three days.
Fluttershy,Wait... Disguises...
Fluttershy,[gasps] That's it! I know how she did it! I know how Meadowbrook got the honey!
Fluttershy,This is how Meadowbrook got the honey from the flash bees!
Cattail,She threw a mask at 'em? I wouldn't recommend that.
Fluttershy,"No. The male bees aren't aggressive around the queen bee, and this mask has the same stripes that she does."
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, that's brilliant!"
Cattail,Whoa!
Fluttershy,There's no time to waste!
Twilight Sparkle,Hooves crossed!
Cattail,"Oh, golly! I can't watch!"
Fluttershy,[coughs] Mind over matter!
Fluttershy,Twilight... It's working!
Twilight Sparkle,"I think she's cured now, Fluttershy."
Zecora,"Ohhh, I do feel fine, and this honey is divine."
Fluttershy,"Oh, you're rhyming again! Welcome back, my friend!"
Zecora,"Thank you, Fluttershy, for all you endured. If not for you, I would not be cured."
Fluttershy,"Oh, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have been sick in the first place."
Zecora,"Regret is not what you should feel, because on this journey, you've learned a great deal."
Fluttershy,"That's true. I certainly learned that if you don't take care of yourself, you won't be able to take care of anypony else. In fact, if I had rested like Twilight had suggested all along, maybe I would have thought to use Meadowbrook's mask sooner."
Apple Bloom,"Okay! let's see how your still life's comin' along, Kettle Corn!"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, that certainly is... round."
Kettle Corn,I can make it rounder!
Apple Bloom,I'm afraid that's all the time we have today. We'll try somethin' else tomorrow.
Kettle Corn,But I like circle painting.
Scootaloo,"And on the way to figuring out what you're meant to do, you'll find a ton more stuff you like. That's what makes looking for your cutie mark so great."
Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle,Mm-hmm.
Apple Bloom,"Sorry, everypony. We're closin' up shop. We'll have to help you out tomorrow."
Foals,Awwww!
Scootaloo,I don't know if we can help them tomorrow. Working with blank flanks one at a time takes forever.
Apple Bloom,If only there was a way we could help a whole herd of them at once.
Sweetie Belle,That would be perfect! We'd save time and they could help each other!
Scootaloo,"Just like we used to! Oh, but it'd have to be somewhere big enough to handle all those blank flanks."
Sweetie Belle,"Somewhere outside, with tons of activities to try."
Apple Bloom,Are you two thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Cutie Mark Day Camp!
Apple Bloom,"And I know just the place, Applejack used to go there when she was little."
Scootaloo,Camp Friendship! Oh. Sorry. I thought we were all gonna yell that one too.
Apple Bloom,"Attention, all blank flanks!"
Scootaloo,And blank flank affiliates! Come to our cutie mark day camp to find out what you're truly good at!
Sweetie Belle,Bond with other blank flanks and find out what you're meant to do together!
Scootaloo,"Hey, Rumble!"
Rumble,"Oh, hey, Crusaders. Look, I can't stop. I've gotta meet my brother for... something."
Apple Bloom,No problem. Just wanted to make sure you heard about our cutie mark day camp. The first session's tomorrow.
Thunderlane,"What'cha got there, little brother?"
Rumble,"What? Oh, nothing. Come on! I want to show you a new dive roll I'm trying."
Scootaloo,"Come one, come all! Cutie Mark Day Camp is for blank flanks of all kinds!"
Thunderlane,Hmmm...
Apple Bloom,"Welcome, cutie mark campers!"
Sweetie Belle,Who's excited to be here?
Sweetie Belle,"Well, we're excited too! At Cutie Mark Day Camp, you'll be able to try all kinds of things!"
Apple Bloom,Kayaking!
Scootaloo,Horseshoe-tossing!
Kettle Corn,Circle-painting!
Apple Bloom,You can try 'em all! But the most important thing is that you'll be tryin' them together.
Scootaloo,That's what worked for us!
Thunderlane,Then I bet it'll work for these little guys too!
Rumble,I thought you said we were gonna go practice for the Wonderbolts Ponyville Extravaganza show.
Thunderlane,I'm going to Wonderbolt practice. You're going to cutie mark practice.
Sweetie Belle,And we're glad to have you!
Skeedaddle,I can't believe your own brother is a Wonderbolt!
Scootaloo,"U-Uh, Rainbow Dash is practically my sister, and she's a Wonderbolt too!"
Pipsqueak,Do you know Spitfire?
Thunderlane,I know she'll be mad if I'm late. [to Rumble] Now you have a good time and try some stuff. Who knows what you'll be good at?
Apple Bloom,All right! Looks like we found the first activity of the day <U+0096> the horseshoe toss!
Thunderlane,"Well, wish I could stay and play, but it's time to fly. Have fun!"
Sweetie Belle,"Come on, Rumble!"
Apple Bloom,Step on up and show us how it's done!
Kettle Corn,No way he's as good as his brother.
Rumble,Egh.
Rumble,"[unenthusiastic] Whoops. Aw, it looks like I won't be getting my cutie mark in the horseshoe toss..."
Sweetie Belle,"Don't worry about it, Rumble. Hardly anypony finds their calling on the first try."
Rumble,"Eh, I wasn't worried."
Scootaloo,Good! 'Cause there's a ton of other stuff to try. We'll find you something you're good at.
Rumble,Whoops.
Rumble,Whoopsie.
Rumble,Whoops.
Skeedaddle,The first and last lines Have five sy-lla-bles but the Mid-ddle has sev-en.
Others,It's called a haiku.
Rumble,[spits] [unenthusiastic] Whoops. I've tried it all. Time to tell my brother this Camp isn't for me.
Scootaloo,"Come on, Rumble. Isn't it fun just trying stuff?"
Rumble,Not really.
Kettle Corn,Haiku cutie mark! And I never would have tried Without Skeedaddle.
Apple Bloom,That's what Cutie Mark Day Camp is all about.
Sweetie Belle,Working together and helping each other.
Kettle Corn,"But I can still come back, right? And maybe paint some circles?"
Scootaloo,Of course! Let's all meet right back here tomorrow.
Foals,Hooray!
Sweetie Belle,Wow. I can't believe we got a cutie mark on the first day!
Apple Bloom,Yup. This camp was a pretty swell idea. Everypony's really enjoyed it.
Scootaloo,[sighs] Everypony except Rumble. He didn't have much luck with anything.
Sweetie Belle,Trying to find out what you're meant to do can be frustrating. You remember how long it took us to get our cutie marks?
Apple Bloom,[shivers] I remember the nightmares.
Scootaloo,"Well, we can't let Rumble quit camp just because he didn't find something he's good at then."
Sweetie Belle,We'll just have to convince him to come back and try harder!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Mm-hmm!
Scootaloo,"Hey, Rumble!"
Rumble,What are you all doing here?
Scootaloo,We just wanted to apologize for not finding anything you liked today.
Rumble,Oh. Whatever. It's fine.
Apple Bloom,"It's not fine. It's frustrating, and we know what it's like."
Rumble,I'm not frustrated!
Scootaloo,It's okay! We've all been there. But we won't give up on helping you.
Sweetie Belle,We know you'll get your cutie mark. Everypony does.
Rumble,"Actually, I don't need your help. Because I don't want to get my cutie mark!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,What?!
Apple Bloom,"I... I must have hay in my ears, because I thought I just heard Rumble say<U+0097>"
Rumble,You heard right! I don't want my cutie mark!
Sweetie Belle,[gasps] He said it again!
Scootaloo,Not wanting a cutie mark is like not wanting to breathe!
Sweetie Belle,Everypony wants to know what they're meant to do!
Rumble,Hmph! Not this pony.
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Why?!
Rumble,"Because cutie marks are silly, and... a-and they just force you into one thing your whole life!"
Sweetie Belle,That's silly. Having a cutie mark doesn't mean you can't do other things.
Apple Bloom,"Yeah! Our cutie marks are in helpin' other ponies with their cutie marks, but I still like makin' potions with Zecora."
Rumble,And when was the last time you did that?
Apple Bloom,"Um... I-I-I think it was, uh... Well, we've been pretty busy helpin' other ponies lately."
Rumble,Oh. You mean doing the thing you got your cutie mark for? The thing you're stuck doing for the rest of your life?!
Sweetie Belle,Okay. Maybe we will be doing that more than anything else. But we love being Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Rumble,"Well, that's fine for you, but I'm not gonna be put in a box!"
Scootaloo,A blank flank who doesn't want a cutie mark? That's gotta be the strangest thing I've ever heard.
Apple Bloom,"Granny always says, ""Some ponies have to find their own hay."""
Scootaloo,"Are you sure she didn't mean ""find their own way""?"
Apple Bloom,Oh. That would make more sense.
Sweetie Belle,"I can't believe Rumble isn't interested in getting his cutie mark either, but we can't force him."
Scootaloo,And we've got a whole camp full of ponies who are interested in getting cutie marks.
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Mm-hmm.
Rumble,"[sighs] Here he comes. The fastest, most elite flyer in Equestria!"
Thunderlane,Thunderlane!
Rumble,"Whoa! [yelps] Urgh... I was gonna say me. You're not the only Pegasus in the family, you know."
Thunderlane,"Oh, sorry, little brother. You're right. You might be the most elite flyer in Equestria some day. But for now, you should try other things, too! Speaking of which, aren't you supposed to be at camp?"
Rumble,[scoffs] That camp is for losers who can't do anything.
Thunderlane,"Great, so there's no pressure. You can try everything and not be worried about looking bad."
Rumble,I'm not worried about that. I just don't want to get a cutie mark in any of their ridiculous activities.
Thunderlane,"Well, you're still going back tomorrow. You can't be a blank flank forever!"
Rumble,Huh...
Sweetie Belle,"All right, cutie mark campers, that's it for jam-making!"
Pipsqueak,"But this is fun, and I didn't get my cutie mark yet. What if I'm not good at anything else?"
Scootaloo,You don't get a cutie mark just because you're good at something or even because you like it. There's more to it than that.
Kettle Corn,"I'm real good at painting circles, but I got my cutie mark in haikus."
Skeedaddle,Which is what I like! But... I'm still a blank flank like you.
Pipsqueak,So you can't get a cutie mark in something you like?
Apple Bloom,"Now, we didn't say that."
Rumble,You don't have to!
Scootaloo,"Rumble, you came back!"
Rumble,Say bye-bye to painting circles. You'll be too busy haiku-ing from now on!
Kettle Corn,But... I like circles.
Apple Bloom,"Come on, Rumble. That's not how cutie marks work."
Pipsqueak,So that's how cutie marks work?
Apple Bloom,Am I speakin' Olde Ponish?! I just said it wasn't!
Rumble,"""Cutie marks are great,"" they say Pfft, yeah, right! They make you special in your way But that special mark that's just for you Will erase the stuff you liiiiiiike... to do"
Kettle Corn,"So, no more painting?"
Skeedaddle,No more haiku?
Sweetie Belle,"Rumble, stop! That's just not true!"
Rumble,"So you're good at charming snakes Too bad! Or you bake delicious cakes Oh, well! Maybe there are lots of things That you like to do Well, your options get pretty stark Once you got that cutie mark"
Others,Blank flanks are better Nopony to tell you who you have to be Blank flanks are better Keep your spirit soarin' free
Others,"So listen up 'cause I ain't lyin' Don't need no mark, so why keep tryin'? If you like just bein' you Then keepin' that blank flank blank Is the thiiiiiiiing to do"
Rumble,You say there's nothin' you can do?
Foals,"Yeah, exactly!"
Rumble,A blank flank is the way for you It's no work to just be who you are No hunt to be some cutie star You're perfect just being you Don't bother with what you cannot do
Rumble and Foals,Blank flanks!
Rumble,...are better Nopony to tell you who you have to be
Rumble and Foals,Blank flanks!
Rumble,...are better Keep your spirit soarin' free
Others,So listen up 'cause I ain't lyin'
Rumble and Foals,Don't need no mark...
Rumble,...so why keep tryin'? If you like just bein' you Then keepin' that blank flank blank Is the thiiiiiiiiiing to do!
Rumble and Foals,Blank flanks!
Pipsqueak,Whoopee!
Apple Bloom,"Now wait just an apple-pickin' minute, Rumble. Where do you think you're leadin' our campers?"
Rumble,They're not your campers anymore! I'm starting a new camp!
Rumble,Everypony on this side of the line is in Camp Blank Flanks Forever!
Scootaloo,Whoa-whoa! You can't be a blank flank forever!
Rumble,That's just the kind of talk I'd expect to hear from Camp Cutie Mark! Which is why blank flanks need a camp where we can enjoy being blank flanks and appreciate our blank flankiness without being pressured to get a cutie mark!
Scootaloo,"Now hold on, everypony."
Rumble,Blank flanks forever!
Sweetie Belle,What just happened?
Scootaloo,Has everypony gone mad?!
Apple Bloom,In a word: yes.
Sweetie Belle,I just can't see what we did wrong. I thought everypony was having fun.
Apple Bloom,They were until that Rumble came and made a mess of things. What are they doing now?
Scootaloo,It looks like whatever they want.
Sweetie Belle,"Honestly, it's not all that different from what they were doing here."
Apple Bloom,Then what was the point?
Scootaloo,Point is that Rumble is a madpony who must be stopped!
Sweetie Belle,"Now calm down, Crusaders. We just need to talk to him again. The key is to remain calm."
Sweetie Belle,[yelling] Cutie marks... make you... special!
Rumble,By putting you in a special little box!
Sweetie Belle,[yelling] Special!
Rumble,Box!
Apple Bloom,"Come on, Sweetie Belle. I think you've ""remained calm"" long enough."
Sweetie Belle,"Kettle Corn, you covered your cutie mark?!"
Kettle Corn,"I'm blank flank again, Keeping my options open. I'm more than haikus."
Sweetie Belle,You just haiku'd right then!
Rumble,Don't let them get in your head! You're an open-ended question! Blank flanks forever!
Foals,Blank flanks forever!
Pipsqueak,Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever!
Pipsqueak,Whoa! You're cracking great!
Skeedaddle,"Thanks! [gasps] Oh, no! What if I get a cutie mark in it?!"
Rumble,"Then you'll be stuck doing it forever! Blank flanks, no more potential cutie mark activities!"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, Cutie Mark Day Camp is a bust."
Apple Bloom,"No, it isn't! It's a swell idea! We just can't seem to talk any sense into that... that Rumble."
Scootaloo,"Maybe we can't, but I bet I know somepony who can."
Thunderlane,Lemme get this straight. My little brother up-ended your entire camp? How in Equestria did he do that?
Thunderlane,"No, I don't. Rumble's good at all that stuff."
Apple Bloom,"Well, that doesn't make a lick of sense. Unless... he was bein' bad at stuff on purpose!"
Thunderlane,[sighs] I was afraid of this...
Scootaloo,Afraid of what?
Thunderlane,"Ever since I became a Wonderbolt, Rumble's either watching me or trying to fly like me. He won't do anything else. That's why I thought your camp was such a good idea."
Scootaloo,"I don't understand. If Rumble wants to be a Wonderbolt someday, what's wrong with that?"
Thunderlane,"Not a thing. But right now, he isn't even giving anything else a chance."
Apple Bloom,Sounds to me like Rumble isn't afraid of bein' put in a box at all.
Sweetie Belle,It doesn't?
Apple Bloom,Nope. I think Rumble's already picked out a box. He's afraid he'll get a cutie mark that'll keep him from it.
Pipsqueak,"I don't know how to say this, Rumble, but Blank Flank Forever Camp is kinda..."
Skeedaddle,Boring?
Rumble,"If we wanna stay blank flanks, we can't risk doing stuff."
Skeedaddle,What if I get a cutie mark in being bored?
Scootaloo,"Attention, blank flanks of Cutie Mark Day Camp!"
Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Mark Crusaders are pleased to announce today's special guest <U+0096> Thunderlane!
Thunderlane,"Hey, everypony! It's me!"
Apple Bloom,"Anypony who's interested, gather 'round for a day of activities with a genuine Wonderbolt!"
Skeedaddle,"Uh, sorry, Rumble. But cutie mark or not, I'm not missing out on this!"
Foals,Whoa!
Apple Bloom,"All right, campers. It's time for our last activity of the day."
Sweetie Belle,A Wonderbolt obstacle course! Just like the one they'll fly through in their upcoming show!
Scootaloo,"But on the ground, since not everypony has wings."
Rumble,"Thunderlane, aren't you gonna run the course?"
Thunderlane,"Nope! I know I'm a Wonderbolt and my cutie mark is all about moving fast, but I really like to cook!"
Rumble,Since when?
Thunderlane,"We take turns making the meals at Wonderbolts HQ. I didn't want to at first, but now I love it! I just wish I'd tried it sooner."
Rumble,You do?
Thunderlane,"Of course! There's more to me than just flying, and I bet there's more to you, too."
Kettle Corn,Obstacles are fun! Running free through mud and dirt Beats circle painting!
Apple Bloom,That haiku pretty well sums it up.
Scootaloo,Looks like Thunderlane was right about the obstacle course getting Rumble to come back over.
Sweetie Belle,"Hey, Rumble. Aren't you gonna do our Wonderbolt course?"
Rumble,I'm cooking today. Maybe I'll do the course tomorrow.
Apple Bloom,So you're comin' back tomorrow?
Scootaloo,You're not worried about getting your cutie mark?
Rumble,Nah. I already know I'm a good flyer. It kinda runs in the family. I guess it's time to see what other stuff I can do.
Thunderlane,Hm-hmm.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh!
Spike,"[belches, sighs] Aw, thank goodness. I thought I had too many deep-fried gems."
Twilight Sparkle,"[mutters] It's from my parents! Spike, they won a zeppelin cruise and get to take the whole family! [sighs] I wish I had time to go with them, but there's just too many princess duties I have to take care of."
Spike,"Come on, Twilight. Even Princess Celestia takes a break sometimes, and she raises the sun."
Spike,"You need a vacation! I can keep track of the friendship log, boost community morale, and answer fan mail for a few days."
Twilight Sparkle,"But, Spike, you're as much a part of my family as anypony. I can't just leave you here to do all that work."
Spike,[loudly] What?! I can't hear you! You're on vacation!
Twilight Sparkle,"I guess I could use a little time off from being a princess. You're the best, Spike!"
Spike,I know.
Twilight Sparkle,I'm gonna go pack everything neatly into one suitcase!
Spike,Wait for it...
Twilight Sparkle,"[shouting] Cruises have activities, right?! I should probably make a schedule?!"
Spike,There it is.
Twilight Velvet,"Oh, gee. I am really looking forward to a relaxing vacation."
Night Light,"Watch out. She won't admit it, but when your mother says ""relaxing vacation"", she means ""doing something crazy"". Last time, she ended up bungee-jumping over Luna Bay!"
Twilight Velvet,"What was that, hon?"
Night Light,"Oh, I was, uh, just telling Twilight about my new, uh, bingo strategy book! It's a, heh, real page-turner!"
Shining Armor,"Oh, I can't wait to get on this zeppelin and fly like a Pegasus!"
Twilight Sparkle,Really? I remember you getting airsick on Admiral Fairweather's Wild Ride at Pony Island.
Shining Armor,"Oh, please! I grew out of airsickness a long time ago."
Iron Will,"[over loudspeaker] I hope you ponies feel welcomed aboard, because you are!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, that was an... assertive welcome."
Night Light,Guess this is what it's like to be big-time prize winners. [laughs] I just wish I could remember what contest we won.
Twilight Sparkle,Wait. You don't know where this prize came from?
Twilight Velvet,"When somepony offers you a free vacation, you just sign the paperwork and don't ask questions!"
Night Light,Especially when it means we all get to fly off together. What should we do first?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I did categorize the ship's activities and make a schedule organized by each of our interests. Dad, you're easy. Bingo competition right here."
Night Light,"Oh, I just love how the numbers and letters are organized in their little boxes. It's so satisfying."
Twilight Sparkle,"Shining Armor, they've got a tiny boat race in a tiny pool here."
Shining Armor,"Aw, sis. Only you would remember I love tiny things."
Twilight Sparkle,"And Cadance, there's a Peewee Princess Playtime here that Flurry's gonna love!"
Princess Cadance,"Oh, wonderful!"
Twilight Velvet,Hmm. This barrel jumping at Neighagra Falls sounds interesting.
Twilight Sparkle,"Eh. I just want to see you all have a good time. And this works out perfectly, because we have room for the one thing I wanna do! Our ship passes the Frozen North at sunset, which is the only time you can see the astrological phenomenon known as the Northern Stars. It's like the stars are shooting out of the setting sun!"
Princess Cadance,"Well, we definitely don't want to miss that."
Twilight Sparkle,Then it's settled. Hmm. But we don't have anything to do right now. Any suggestions?
Iron Will,"[over loudspeaker] Attention, cruise ponies! Don't let this zeppelin be a bore! Leave your room and see the tour!"
Princess Cadance,A tour could be fun.
Princess Cadance,"I'm afraid Flurry may be airsick. Since I know that isn't a problem for you, would you mind taking her below?"
Iron Will,"[over loudspeaker] Far to our right, you can just make out the white tufts of Cloudsdale, where Princess Twilight Sparkle once toured the weather factory."
Twilight Sparkle,How'd he know that? And why announce it on a cruise?
Princess Cadance,Why don't we move to the other side of the deck?
Iron Will,"[over loudspeaker] We are now high enough to see all of Canterlot, even the royal tree where Princess Twilight and her brother Shining Armor were born!"
Twilight Sparkle,What? That's not right.
Twilight Velvet,[gasps] Oooh!
Night Light,Let's get down for that!
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, you guys know that's not where we were born. What are you so excited about?"
Night Light,"Well, it is a really nice tree, sweetheart."
Others,"""Raspberry Sorbet"": We just wanted to say how excited we are to be here!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Um... yeah. Us, too."
Iron Will,"[over loudspeaker] On our route north, we will pass the spires of the Crystal Empire, where Princess Cadance rescued her Alicorn baby Spike from a monster made of fire!"
Princess Cadance,"Well, that doesn't even make sense."
Night Light,"Well, ""Royal Grandparents"" sounds a bit fancy, but of course you can take our picture."
Twilight Sparkle,What?!
Princess Cadance,Uh... Oh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, that's it! Does anypony know where the cruise announcer is?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Excuse me, sir."
Iron Will,"You can call Iron Will ""Iron Will""!"
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] What are you doing here? And why do you keep announcing random things about me and my family?
Iron Will,"The assertiveness seminar market dried up, so Iron Will started a new career organizing themed vacation packages!"
Twilight Sparkle,And the theme of this vacation is...
Iron Will,"[over loudspeaker] Everypony, stomp your hooves if you are here for the premiere Cruise of the Princesses Experience!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Iron Will, I'm not sure it was entirely honest of you to offer this cruise to my family without telling us that ponies bought tickets just to see Cadance and me!"
Iron Will,Iron Will outlined all the details of the cruise in the Prize Acceptance and Consent Form that you signed.
Twilight Velvet,"Well, when somepony offers you a free vacation, who reads the fine print?"
Iron Will,"Iron Will prides himself on providing a quality vacation experience. But if Twilight Sparkle and her family don't want it, Iron Will can cancel the cruise and break the hearts of every princess-adoring pony on board."
Pony in Window,"I love you, Princess Twilight!"
Princess Cadance,"As much as I want a family vacation, I don't think I could entertain all these cruise ponies. My hooves are pretty full taking care of Flurry Heart."
Twilight Velvet,I guess we were just so excited by the idea of a family cruise.
Night Light,[sighs heavily] All right. I guess we better turn this ship around.
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait! Iron Will, what if I offered you a deal? If I agree to do whatever princess activities you want, will you promise that my family gets to do the activities they want?"
Shining Armor,"Sis, you don't have to do that. We want you to enjoy yourself, too."
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't want the vacation to end now or let down all these ponies who were looking forward to seeing us. So what do you say, Iron Will? Do we have a deal?"
Iron Will,Princess Twilight has a deal!
Twilight Sparkle,Great! So it looks like we have some time before Dad plays Bingo.
Iron Will,"Actually, we have just enough to pick the winner of our grand-prize raffle."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. Well... [chuckles] who doesn't like prizes?
Iron Will,"All right, cruise ponies! When the zeppelin flies, it's time for a prize!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you all for being so gracious and respectful to me and my family. And now, without further ado, the winner is..."
Twilight Sparkle,Star Tracker!
Twilight Sparkle,"Congratulations, Star Tracker! Enjoy your prize! Okay, Dad! Bingo time!"
Twilight Sparkle,Uh... Oh. I'm sorry. I don't have the prize.
Iron Will,"Congratulations to Star Tracker, who wins the grand prize <U+0096> spending the day with Twilight as an honorary member of her family!"
Twilight Sparkle,That's the prize?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, well... I guess you should come with us, honorary family member."
Night Light,Sure! [laughs] There's always room at the bingo table!
Twilight Sparkle,[amplified] Ahem! Is everypony ready?
Night Light,"Sure are, sweetie! Give that cage a whirl!"
Twilight Sparkle,Dad? [amplified] What did you say?
Star Tracker,"He... He said to, uh, uh, give it a-a whirl. Heh."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh. Um, thanks."
Twilight Sparkle,[amplified] I-19!
Night Light,"Hey, hey! Now we're talkin'! This Princess Bingo is great!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Did you get that one, Dad? [amplified] Can anypony tell me how my dad is doing?"
Star Tracker,"He, uh, he said the Princess Bingo is, uh, great. Heh."
Star Tracker,Twilight is my favorite time of day. [laughs] And it's also your name. [laughs] So I just thought that was cool.
Twilight Sparkle,Phew! Just made it!
Twilight Sparkle,And I'm ready to give you the tiny boat race of your life!
Twilight Sparkle,"Are you sure you're not airsick, big brother?"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't think that's how it works. But I'm ready if you are.
Iron Will,"Technically, Princess Twilight Sparkle should officiate the princess paddle boat race."
Twilight Velvet,"Well, I suppose I could could race your brother."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh. Well, as long as Shining Armor gets to race, I'm happy."
Star Tracker,[nervous noises] S-Sorry.
Star Tracker,[nervous] I'm gonna write about this race tonight in my journal! [nervous noises] It's just so exciting!
Twilight Sparkle,"On your mark, get set<U+0097>"
Shining Armor,"[nauseous] Just so everypony knows, I'm getting out of this boat because of how not sick I feel."
Twilight Velvet,"Aww, that's all right, dear. We'll take you back to the room."
Iron Will,[through microphone] That was just the first heat! Of ten!
Iron Will,"Now, who's ready to see a princess face when they win their race?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Cadance, I'm so glad you got in the Peewee Princess Playtime!"
Princess Cadance,Flurry is having a wonderful time.
Twilight Sparkle,That's great. I'm just on my way to take some old-time Appleloosan photos!
Twilight Sparkle,And then do a quick question-and-answer session on becoming an Alicorn before Mom's barrel ride at Neighagra Falls! I really hope I don't miss that.
Princess Cadance,"Twilight, are you sure you don't mind doing all of these princess activities?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Mind? What? Absolutely not. I mean, you guys are having fun, right? [sighs] Besides, I have to make sure these cruise ponies are happy if I want to be a good princess."
Princess Cadance,"You're already a good princess, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"Honestly, as long as I get to see the Northern Stars tonight with everypony, I'll be happy. But right now, I gotta go take some pictures. See you later!"
Forceful Parent Pony,Why don't you play and make a princess friend?
Princess Cadance,"Uh... I am so sorry, everypony, but it looks like Flurry needs her nap."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, why did that last question have to be a two-parter? I just hope I have time for one barrel ride with Mom!"
Twilight Velvet,"[gasps] Neighagra Falls was amazing! The endless open air, the water in my mane! Oh! The small confines of the barrel!"
Twilight Velvet,"Oh, honey, I know you're disappointed, but we waited as long as we could. Maybe you should take a break from these princess things."
Twilight Sparkle,Disappointed? No! I've just been answering some detailed questions about Alicorns! You know how much I love details!
Twilight Velvet,"I just don't want you to forget. It's your vacation, too."
Twilight Sparkle,How can I when it's a totally successful vacation?
Night Light,"All right. Well, uh, we can't wait to see those Northern Stars!"
Iron Will,"Iron Will lived up to his side of the bargain, and Princess Twilight only has one more thing to do for the day."
Iron Will,[through microphone] It's your last chance. Come get in line if you want the princess to sign!
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] How long have you been waiting?
Princess Cadance,"You were right, Twilight. They were breathtaking."
Night Light,"Aw, we wish you'd been here to see it, sweet-pea, but we're sure you're making a whole bunch of cruise ponies happy."
Star Tracker,[laughs] I'm so happy I could cry!
Twilight Sparkle,"[suddenly indignant] Oh, yeah. The cruise ponies are happy. My family is happy. Even Iron Will is happy."
Twilight Sparkle,You know who isn't happy? Me!
Star Tracker,"[yelp of pain] Augh, my hoof!"
Twilight Sparkle,[insincerely] I'm sorry. But maybe that wouldn't have happened if you weren't practically standing on my tail! Not even my real family stands so close! Rrgh!
Princess Cadance,Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,I only made that deal with Iron Will so my family and the cruise ponies could have the vacation they wanted.
Princess Cadance,What about what you wanted?
Twilight Sparkle,I just want everypony to be happy.
Princess Cadance,"Well, sometimes ponies want more from a princess than you can give, and it can be hard to know where to draw the line."
Twilight Sparkle,You seem to know pretty well.
Princess Cadance,"Once I had Flurry Heart, the line was easier for me to see. You will always have obligations as a princess, but you also have an obligation to yourself."
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] You're right. I think I need to set some boundaries. But first, I owe somepony an apology."
Twilight Velvet,"Aww, how's that, dearie?"
Star Tracker,Better. Thanks.
Star Tracker,"[panicking] Uh, I think I should go!"
Twilight Sparkle,"No, Star Tracker. You should stay. I have something to tell you. All of you. I'm glad you all got to do the things you wanted, but I should have stood up for myself so that I could do what I wanted, too. [to Star Tracker] It wasn't fair of me to lash out at you. If I felt like you were standing too close, I should have said something. I'm sorry. [to everypony] What do you say we do something off the schedule?"
Star Tracker,Who are you?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yup! We're gonna do something I want us to do, as a family. Honorary members, too."
Night Light,Now that's cold! This is more like it!
Star Tracker,"You and your family have been really kind to include me, but you deserve your own vacation together. [laughs nervously] And I'm really glad we met, too!"
Twilight Sparkle,Ohhh!
Iron Will,"[through microphone] Attention, cruise ponies! If it's your dream, come to the deck for ice cream!"
Star Tracker,"Oh, no! Leave the princess alone!"
Iron Will,What did you say to Iron Will?
Twilight Sparkle,"It's okay, everypony. [through microphone] [clears throat] First, I want to thank all of you for coming. It means a lot that you'd spend your hard-earned bits just to be with us. But I honestly came on this cruise to take some time off from being a princess. I'm just a pony, too, after all. And even though I want everypony here to be happy, I'd really like to spend the rest of the cruise relaxing with my family."
Cruise Pony 2,"Of course, Princess Twilight."
Cruise Pony 3,But why was this trip advertised as a Cruise of the Princesses if you just wanted to get away?
Iron Will,[whistling] Iron Will's Cruise of the Princesses makes no guarantees as to the participation of actual princesses.
Cruise pony,What?!
Iron Will,But Iron Will learned his lesson before. Satisfaction not guaranteed. No refuuuuuuunds!
Shining Armor,"Wow. He may be pushy and manipulative, but nopony can say that minotaur isn't prepared."
Twilight Sparkle,There's still plenty of activities. We pass Fillydelphia on the way back. I could give Flurry Heart a quick history tour.
Princess Cadance,"That's very thoughtful. But right now, the family and I have something scheduled for you."
Night Light,Behold! The Northern Stars!
Twilight Sparkle,"You did all this for me? This is amazing! Thank you. And Shining Armor, I can't believe you're up there even though you're airsick!"
Shining Armor,"I am not air<U+0097> [gurgles] [nauseous] Oh, okay. Maybe I'm not feeling great!"
Twilight Velvet,"Oh, dear!"
Night Light,Whatever you say.
Twilight Sparkle,Now this is the only activity I need.
Pinkie Pie,"Okay. All we need is a dot of salt, a dab of sugar, and a spritz of ginger."
Twilight Sparkle,Uh... Are those real measurements? How do you keep track without a recipe?
Pinkie Pie,Pie baking is more art than science. And this will be my masterpiece! It's to celebrate Rainbow Dash's seventy-third Wonderbolt training session!
Twilight Sparkle,Seventy-third? That's specific.
Pinkie Pie,"I know! The pie is blueberry because Wonderbolt outfits are blue. The crust is rainbow, for obvious reasons. But the most special part is the seventy-three super secret sweets and spices that represent each training session! [giggles] Could you please pass the... [quickly] brown sugar, pink sugar, sweetroot, apple jelly, berry mash, and a towel?"
Twilight Sparkle,You sure are going to a lot of trouble for Rainbow Dash's pie.
Pinkie Pie,"Phew! That's because I know how much she loves them! My pies are her favorite! It's worth all the trouble to see her happy. Now I'm going to need some cocoa powder, cocoa flakes<U+0097> Ooh! Cocoa bar! [chomp] [mouthful] Want some?"
Twilight Sparkle,Isn't that for the pie?
Pinkie Pie,"[gulps, laughing] Oh, Twilight! That's hilarious! You don't mix chocolate into a blueberry pie! This is my mid morning, pie-making chocolate fuel that keeps this pie baking train chugging down the tracks! [chomp, babbles, gulp] Break time's over! Now let's finish this pie! Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, choo-choo!"
Spitfire,"Good training, everypony. Nice work, Crash. You really added that sparkle to that pressure diamond-drop."
Rainbow Dash,My seventy-third training session? That's specific.
Pinkie Pie,"I know! I'm just so proud and happy for you, and I've been counting all your training sessions, and I was going to wait until your hundredth, but I got too excited, and I know how much you love pie, so happy seventy-third training session!"
Rainbow Dash,Whaaa?! You didn't have to do this.
Pinkie Pie,"I know I didn't have to, but I reeeally wanted to! [squealing] Have a bite."
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa! What's that?! Huh. Guess it was nothing. But wow, heh. This pie is the best I've ever had! Mmm! Is that cinnamon?"
Pinkie Pie,I knew you'd love it! Have more. I made the whole thing for you.
Rainbow Dash,"Really? Oh, that's so great! But I need to go change. A-And then I have to take Tank to the vet. Heh. His sensitive tortoise tummy's been acting up again. Do you mind if I take this pie with me?"
Pinkie Pie,Of course not! I gotta get back to my shift at Sugarcube Corner anyway. Congratulations again!
Rainbow Dash,Heh. Thanks.
Pinkie Pie,[sighs] I knew she'd love it. [gasps deeply] Is that...? Is that...?!
Pinkie Pie,Stop!
Pinkie Pie,"You didn't see a blueberry rainbow-crust seventy-three-ingredient pie with a slice eaten out of it in here, did you?"
Janitor Pony,Uh... n-no?
Pinkie Pie,"Right. Of course you didn't. That would be ridiculous. Because I made it for Rainbow Dash, and she loves my pies. She would never throw them away like trash in the trash with other trash, right? Right?!"
Janitor Pony,Um... riiight?
Pinkie Pie,"Hmmm... That pie couldn't have been the one I made. I must be seeing things. I did have a lot of chocolate this morning. [chomp, gulps] But what if I wasn't seeing things? What if that was my pie? [scoffs] That would be bananas! [chuckles, laughing crazily] [gasps] Unless Rainbow Dash's been replaced by an imposter who throws delicious pies away!"
Pinkie Pie,Or... has she been brainwashed by a pie-hating evil queen?
Pinkie Pie,"You make a good point. Rainbow Dash is too stubborn to be brainwashed. Plus she hates washing. Hmm. There's something else going on here. Let's look up a few of the more recent pies I've made for her. The boysenberry pie I made for her birthday... and her three half-birthday lemon meringues... and the ""It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway Day"" custard pie! She ate all of these... Right?"
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] Another pie!? Thank you so much! Whoa! What's that?!
Rainbow Dash,[chewing noises] Huh. Guess it was nothing. Heh-heh.
Rainbow Dash,"Awesome! Three lemon meringues? Uh... Hey, what's that over there?"
Rainbow Dash,"[chewing noises] Oh, never mind. Heh. Great pies!"
Pinkie Pie,"Happy ""It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway"" Day!"
Rainbow Dash,Thank you! No way! Check that out!
Shoeshine,Oh! It's not even my birthday!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, sorry. Guess it was nothing. [slurp] Mmm! But that custard was everything!"
Pinkie Pie,Have I ever really seen Rainbow Dash eat one of my pies? And do I always look when somepony points behind me? What's there?! Heh. Good one. But I need answers.
Pinkie Pie,"I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie every month she's been a Wonderbolt, and you're telling me you've never seen her eat one?"
Others,"Spitfire, Soarin, Uhhh..."
Spitfire,"Uh, affirmative. Or, uh, negative. Um... I-I-I mean, she wasn't seen eating one."
Pinkie Pie,Hmm... Interesting. Very interesting.
Spitfire,Are we under investigation?
Pinkie Pie,"As chief detective on the pie case, I've labeled you all ponies-of-interest. So it's best you tell me everything you know."
Spitfire,"Well, we have been getting mysterious monthly pie donations."
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Would you be able to pick these pies out of a line up?
Pinkie Pie,I hear Rainbow Dash's pet tortoise Tank has been having tummy troubles. When did it start?
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. About a week ago. Poor Tank had all the telltale signs of sugar overload <U+0096> jittery shell, sleeplessness, reptilian indigestion."
Pinkie Pie,"Hmmm... And this all happened the day after I made Rainbow Dash a ""Thanks For Lending Me Your Jacket"" peach pie. It seems the pieces of the puzzle are plopping into place, but the picture isn't pretty. [gasps] Note to self <U+0096> P. Alliteration Pie. Is that everything, Doctor?"
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. Well, there's also this."
Pinkie Pie,Interesting. Did you have the lab analyze the flavor of that pie?
Dr. Fauna,"Dr. No. But you know, Miss Cheerilee was in here not long ago. The class hamster was having similar symptoms. [gasps] Perhaps it's a pie pandemic!"
Pinkie Pie,Perhaps. And I just might know Pony Patient Zero!
Cheerilee,Dr. Fauna's right. I do always have to remind the foals and fillies not to share the pies with the class hamster. Animals just can't digest pony food.
Pinkie Pie,Indeed. But where do these pies come from?
Cheerilee,"Well, they're from Rainbow Dash. She drops off her ""Day After Rainbow Dash's Half-Birthday"" pie every year."
Pinkie Pie,"Did you say the day after her half-birthday?! Very, very interesting. Because I give her a pie on her half-birthday every year! And I have a feeling it's the same pie."
Cheerilee,"Well, wherever it comes from, the students just love it."
Pinkie Pie,I'm so glad. At least I can be sure somepony is.
Pinkie Pie,"She didn't eat the blueberry. She didn't eat the banana. She didn't eat the cream, and she didn't eat the chocolate. She didn't eat any of 'em! Why?! And don't tell me this all just started recently! It's been going on for years! Cheerilee said so herself. If there's one thing I know, you can't escape the truth!"
Applejack,Pinkie Pie?! Pinkie Pie!
Applejack,Whooooaaaa! [grunting] Oh. Party-planning cave. Right. You okay? Or are you just screamin' for fun?
Pinkie Pie,"Screaming is fun. But I'm not okay! I've been making Rainbow Dash pies for years, but she doesn't even like them. She's been lying to me!"
Applejack,But everypony loves your pies. they're the greatest thing since sliced apples.
Pinkie Pie,Thank you!
Applejack,And I could swear I've seen her eat one of your pies before.
Pinkie Pie,Have you reeeaaally?
Applejack,"Um, I... thought I had. That's why I said it?"
Pinkie Pie,Are you sure?
Applejack,Maybe I haven't...?
Pinkie Pie,Exactly! Because it's all been a sham! Rainbow Dash has been laughing at my pies behind my back and scheming of a way to get rid of them for years!
Rainbow Dash,Bring forth the worst-tasting food in all of Equestria!
Rainbow Dash,"And now I will destroy Pinkie Pie's horrid abominations, freeing the land of these disgusting pies forever!"
Pinkie Pie,Nooooooo!
Rainbow Dash,"Good riddance, strawberry cream and peaches 'o plenty! Begone, apple crumble and lemon surprise!"
Applejack,I really don't think that's what's happening.
Pinkie Pie,I don't think so either. I know so.
Applejack,"Well, I've got just the thing to get your mind off all this madness. We've had a great apple harvest, so I was hopin' you could whip up a few of your delicious pies."
Pinkie Pie,"Yes. I will make pies. Lots of pies. I'm going to make Rainbow Dash so many pies, it'll force her to admit the truth. Or I'll catch her in the act of getting rid of them. Operation: ""Pie of Lies"" is a go. Thanks, Applejack. I knew I could count on you to come up with a plan."
Applejack,"I don't think that's what I did. Also, uh... how do you get out of here?"
Pinkie Pie,Surprise!
Rainbow Dash,[yelps] W-W-What's happening?!
Pinkie Pie,"Happy unofficial ""Wake Your Friends Up"" Day!"
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh. I've never heard of ""Wake Your Friends Up"" Day."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, it's unofficial. But I made you your favorite pie in celebration! Ta-da! Gifts are the second most important part of ""Wake Your Friends Up"" Day."
Rainbow Dash,What's the first most important part?
Pinkie Pie,Accepting the gifts and enjoying them immediately.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh... Well, I'm sorry I forgot about ""Wake Your Friends Up"" Day. Let me make it up to you. Here!"
Pinkie Pie,[sneezes] The pie! Where'd it go?!
Rainbow Dash,What do you mean where did it go? Heh-heh. Mmm-mmm.
Pinkie Pie,Congratulations on your seventy-fourth Wonderbolt training session! Here's a pie. Now eat it!
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, this is getting a little out of hoof. I haven't even trained yet."
Pinkie Pie,"Well, I wanted to pre-celebrate because I already know how great you're gonna do. Eat the pie!"
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie, look out!"
Rainbow Dash,Pinkie! Are you okay?!
Pinkie Pie,[grunting] Get me down!
EMT Pony,"Sorry, ma'am, but we have to make sure you didn't sustain any internal injuries."
Pinkie Pie,But the pie! What happened to the pie?!
Rainbow Dash,Oh! The pie was delicious! You just get better!
Pinkie Pie,Noooooooo!
Pinkie Pie,"[unconvincing] Ah! Somepony help me! Rainbow Dash, thank goodness you're here! I was trying to fix the top pie on my pie pyramid, but the whole thing became unstable. And there's only one way to save me! You have to eat the pies!"
Rainbow Dash,"Don't worry, I got ya!"
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, right. Or you could save me that way."
Rainbow Dash,"You gotta be more careful, okay?"
Pinkie Pie,[growls] Rrgh!
Pinkie Pie,"Rainbow Dash! I wanted to thank you for saving me from the pie pyramid, so have a pie! Have three! Have fifteen! I know how much you love them! Now eat up!"
Rainbow Dash,Uh... Thanks!
Rainbow Dash,I can't wait to eat [loudly] all these pies!
Pinkie Pie,What!? Where did they<U+0097>?! How did you<U+0097>?!
Rainbow Dash,"Delicious! You did it again, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie,"Rainbow Dash, there you are! I made a pie for everypony, and you're the only one who hasn't eaten hers yet. So here. Your pie. For you to eat. Now."
Rainbow Dash,Are you okay? You seem to be staring more than usual.
Rainbow Dash,You sure you don't have to blink?
Pinkie Pie,Me? Nope. I'm not much of a blinker. [licking] Don't mind me. Go ahead and take a bite.
Rainbow Dash,"Well... Do I want to take a big bite or a small bite...? I just don't know... Or maybe medium? No, no, no. Definitely not medium."
Pinkie Pie,[panting] [strained] Just try some.
Rainbow Dash,Ahhhh... Do you have any milk?
Rainbow Dash,"Ah, never mind. Your pies are just too good to resist."
Pinkie Pie,What?! No! No! That's it! I can't take it!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, everything okay, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pie,No! Everything is not okay! You hate my pies!
Rainbow Dash,What are you talking about?
Pinkie Pie,"You know exactly what I'm talking about! I saw what you did! Well, I didn't see what you did. But I know that you've been fake-eating my pies! You threw away the pie I made for your seventy-third Wonderbolt training session, and I know you secretly somehow got rid of all the other pies I gave you! Admit it!"
Rainbow Dash,That's crazy! What do you think I did? Somehow make them all disappear into thin air?
Rainbow Dash,[nervous chuckle] Okay. So maybe I made one of them disappear into thin air.
Pinkie Pie,How could you?!
Rainbow Dash,"What?! I, uh... I-I just wanted to share these amazing pies with the folks of Cloudsdale! So I, uh... I was trying to send them up via... balloon mail."
Pinkie Pie,But you just said they were delicious.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, obviously that's because... I have amnesia!"
Rainbow Dash,I've been brainwashed!
Rainbow Dash,I-It's Opposite Day?
Pinkie Pie,"Your memory is working fine, you hate washing, and I know today's not Opposite Day because I baked you a pie for it every year. A pie that you'd probably just throw away. Or give to charity. Or destroy with your laser eyes while laughing at me!"
Rainbow Dash,Laser eyes?
Pinkie Pie,Oh! Oh! So you admit it!
Rainbow Dash,What? No! I can explain!
Pinkie Pie,I don't want to hear it!
Rainbow Dash,She won't listen to me. She won't let me apologize. [sighs] I feel terrible.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, you have been lying to her. To all of us, actually."
Applejack,Yeah. Is there anything else you're lyin' about that we should know?
Rainbow Dash,"No! Well, not that I can think of off the top of my head. Is it my fault that I don't like pies? And not just Pinkie's pies. All pies! I know how much she loves making pies, and if I told her I didn't like them, it would have crushed her."
Applejack,"Uh, you kinda crushed her anyway."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, but I...! [stutters, sighs] You're right. I guess I should've just eaten the pies in the first place. [gasps] Wait! That's it! I know how I can make it up to her!"
Pinkie Pie,"Pee-yew! Gummy, is that you?"
Pinkie Pie,Huh. What is that? Oh. It's you.
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie, wait! I know now that I should've been honest with you from the start, because lying to your friends is wrong. And because getting rid of all those pies was a giant hassle. I mean, do you have any idea how many pies you've made for me over the years?"
Pinkie Pie,"Yes, I know exactly how many. I have a very detailed pie-ling system."
Rainbow Dash,"Of course you do. The point is I thought the hassle was worth it just to spare your feelings, but I was wrong. So to make up for it, I made this pie for you. Well, I guess I made it for me. To eat in front of you. Point is I'm eating this pie for friendship!"
Pinkie Pie,Wait. That smelly circular monstrosity is a pie?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! I know I can't go back and eat all the pies you made for me in the past, so instead I'm going to eat this one giant one for you now. So here I go."
Rainbow Dash,Ahhhh...
Pinkie Pie,Wait! I can't watch you do this!
Pinkie Pie,"I mean, is that crust or some kind of concrete?"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, honestly, I have no idea."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, I can't believe you're willing to eat this terrible pie for me. It's ridiculous, and this whole thing is overly complicated, and... [sighs] I think I finally understand why you lied."
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! What's that?!
Rainbow Dash,[chewing noises] Huh. Guess it was nothing. Heh-heh.
Pinkie Pie,[squeals] I'm so glad you enjoyed my pies!
Rainbow Dash,"[chewing noises] Oh, never mind. Heh. Great pies!"
Rainbow Dash,No way! Check that out!
Shoeshine,Oh! It's not even my birthday!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, sorry. Guess it was nothing. [slurp] Mmm! But that custard was everything!"
Pinkie Pie,Seeing you eat my pies makes me the happiest pony in all of Equestria!
Rainbow Dash,Heh. I know it does.
Pinkie Pie,You did a lot of ridiculous and overly complex things to get rid of my pies because it made you happy to see me happy. Just like I went to a lot of effort to make you the pies because it made me happy to see you happy.
Rainbow Dash,Yes!
Pinkie Pie,"And if you're willing to go through all of that, it really shows how much you're willing to do for your friends."
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, shucks. It was nothing."
Pinkie Pie,Now get out of that thing and give me a hug!
Pinkie Pie,"Just remember. In the future, you can always be honest with me."
Applejack,"Uh, I could've told her that."
Rainbow Dash,[straining] Heh. Cool. H-How about this? Your hugs are too tight.
Pinkie Pie,"[laughing] No, they're not."
Starlight Glimmer,Oooh! Excuse me. When does the noon train from the Crystal Empire arrive?
Others,"""All Aboard"": Uh... noon?"
Starlight Glimmer,Heh. Right. Sorry. I'm just a little excited because my friend Sunburst is coming.
Starlight Glimmer,"He's my oldest friend. I mean, we've known each other practically forever. We have tons in common."
Starlight Glimmer,"We both love magic and games and jokes <U+0096> everything, really. Now that I think about it, there isn't a pony in all of Equestria I have more in common with."
Sunburst,Starlight?
Starlight Glimmer,[gasps] Sunburst! You made it!
Sunburst,Of course! I've been looking forward to this visit for a long time.
Starlight Glimmer,[grunts] Whoa. How long are you staying?
Sunburst,"Uh, just a... little reading for the train."
Starlight Glimmer,"[chuckles] Same old Sunburst. [grunts] It's going to be so great spending time together. Just like old times. You and me doing the stuff we like <U+0096> games, magic..."
Sunburst,Antiquing.
Starlight Glimmer,What?
Sunburst,Antiquing. You know I like antiquing.
Starlight Glimmer,You do?
Sunburst,"Um, of course! Historical knickknacks, ancient relics... Oh! You are so lucky! Ponyville is antique central!"
Starlight Glimmer,It is?
Sunburst,"How have we never talked about this? We are going antiquing, and you are gonna love it!"
Starlight Glimmer,Okay. Let's drop your stuff off at the castle first.
Sunburst,This is so great! Who knew I'd be the one showing you the cool sights of Ponyville?
Starlight Glimmer,I'm a little surprised myself.
Sunburst,"Wow! What a difference between the hoof-molded bricks and the extruded ones, right?"
Starlight Glimmer,Uh-huh... Ha-ha...
Sunburst,"Oooh! Check out all these chandeliers! Sometimes, the crystals have magical properties."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh. Oh, that's cool. How do you<U+0097>?"
Twilight Sparkle,Sunburst! I'm so glad you're here!
Sunburst,In the antique store?
Twilight Sparkle,"In Ponyville! Starlight's really been looking forward to your visit. Though I'm glad you're in the antique store, too. I'm usually the only one."
Sunburst,"That's crazy! Who doesn't like antiquing, right?"
Starlight Glimmer,[nervous chuckle] Right.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oooh, look! An ancient map of Equestria made by the Mighty Helm."
Sunburst,"Without the help of unicorn magic or Pegasus flight, the Earth ponies of the Mighty Helm were able to map the entire coast of Equestria."
Starlight Glimmer,Coooool...
Sunburst,You don't have to pretend to like all this stuff.
Starlight Glimmer,"What? No! I do like it. I mean, if you like it, I like it. Besides, we've almost looked at everything, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, wow! You have got to see this Saddle Arabian vanity!"
Starlight Glimmer,This shop looked a lot smaller from the outside.
Sunburst,Did you see this Palominian letter opener?
Twilight Sparkle,Wow! That goes well with this ancient phoenix feather quill! We could write to each other!
Starlight Glimmer,"[joins laughter, sighs] Um, I-I really like this old-timey barrel."
Sunburst,"Actually, the stuff I bought is inside the barrel. But I can't wait to see what it is!"
Starlight Glimmer,Wait. You don't know what you bought?
Sunburst,"Mm-mmm. It's a blind buy. Sometimes shops get too busy to go through everything, so they load up a box or barrel and sell it without knowing what's inside."
Twilight Sparkle,Buying one is sort of like a treasure hunt.
Sunburst,Once I found a first edition History of Equestria in the original Olde Ponish.
Twilight Sparkle,Hliet foresettan pliht!
Sunburst,"It's an Olde Ponish saying. ""Reward prefers risk!"" Uh, it loses something in the translation."
Twilight Sparkle,Why don't we look through this stuff later?
Sunburst,"Yeah. What do you want to do, Starlight?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I don't know if you're gonna remember this, but..."
Sunburst,[gasps] Is this...?!
Starlight Glimmer,Dragon Pit!
Twilight Sparkle,I remember that game. You two used to play it?
Sunburst,Pretty much any time we weren't working on magic. I can't believe you found a copy!
Starlight Glimmer,"Sunburst would get so excited whenever his dragon got trapped, he knocked the whole board over."
Twilight Sparkle,That's adorable.
Sunburst,"Uh, well, it's an exciting game. But I have a little more control over my horn now."
Starlight Glimmer,Uh-oh! Somepony's dragon's gonna get trapped!
Twilight Sparkle,Doesn't seem so exciting to m<U+0097>
Sunburst,Huh. I guess it is adorable.
Starlight Glimmer,I hope you're enjoying your visit so far.
Sunburst,"Are you kidding? I mean, first antiquing and then spending time with Twilight?"
Starlight Glimmer,Oh. Yeah. She's pretty great.
Sunburst,"Right? I mean, I know she's a princess, but I never thought she'd be so fun to just hang out with."
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, she is the Princess of Friendship."
Sunburst,[chuckle] Right. I guess that makes sense.
Starlight Glimmer,So tomorrow I thought<U+0097>
Sunburst,I suppose I'm just surprised at how well we get along. I don't have much in common with most ponies.
Starlight Glimmer,You two are pretty similar. I don't know many ponies who are fluent in Olde Ponish.
Sunburst,Exactly! I probably have more in common with Twilight than any pony in Equestria!
Starlight Glimmer,Right...
Sunburst,"[sighs] Anyway, I better get some sleep. [yawns] Ponyville might be small, but there's a lot to do. Maybe we should ask Twilight what she recommends we see!"
Starlight Glimmer,Um... sure.
Sunburst,"Great! Good night, Starlight."
Starlight Glimmer,Um...
Starlight Glimmer,...Good night.
Starlight Glimmer,"[singsong] Knock, knock!"
Sunburst,"[yelps] Oh. Hi, Starlight. [yawns] Is it morning already?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Yup! Maybe a bit early, but like you said, there's a lot to see in Ponyville."
Sunburst,Uh... Right. Okay.
Starlight Glimmer,"Plus, I couldn't really sleep. I just kept thinking about all the stuff we have in common and how much fun we'll have today."
Sunburst,"Great. Uh, is Twilight up yet?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, I'm pretty sure she's busy with princess stuff today."
Starlight Glimmer,But I've got a full day of stuff planned. Just you and me.
Sunburst,"Uh, great. Um, would you mind turning around or preferably... leaving the room so I could get changed?"
Starlight Glimmer,One genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple tree! Because we used to drink so much apple juice as foals?
Sunburst,"Uh, I don't remember that."
Trixie,[yelps] Ow.
Starlight Glimmer,Trixie? What are you doing here?
Trixie,"Huh. I often seek the privacy of the orchard to practice new feats of amazement. And also, I fell asleep."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh. Well, Sunburst and I were just catching up, so<U+0097>"
Trixie,[gasps] I don't suppose the two of you want to see a never-before-witnessed magical marvel?
Sunburst,Sure!
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] Why not?
Trixie,"Behold, visiting friend from Starlight's past, and be amazed by the Great and Powerful <U+0096> and current best friend of Starlight <U+0096> Trixie!"
Trixie,I give you... the Unicorn Escape! [grunting] Just... a sec... One more... [grunts] twist... and... [grunts] [straining] The Great and Powerful Trixie requires a little assistance.
Sunburst,"I know this trick. There's a special link, but I could never hold the chain up long enough to find it."
Trixie,"Well, if I could do magic like that, I'd have a whole slew of new tricks at my disposal."
Sunburst,I always liked close-up magic because I knew I could do it if I just practiced enough.
Trixie,"Starlight, why didn't you tell me how much Sunburst and I had in common?"
Starlight Glimmer,[sarcastic] Gee. I don't know.
Starlight Glimmer,"I know Trixie's ""magic"" is, you know, fun. But the Mirror Pool is actual magic."
Sunburst,Whoa. This place is pure pony lore.
Starlight Glimmer,"Yup. I mean, it's supposed to be all dangerous, and I guess I shouldn't have broken the seal to get in, but you wanted to see the sights of Ponyville, right?"
Sunburst,"So, Pinkie Pie just dove in and made copies of herself?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Mm-hmm. If we made copies of ourselves, we could get a year's worth of hanging out over in one day."
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, not that we would."
Sunburst,Do you hear that?
Starlight Glimmer,Oh. I hope it's not a leftover Pinkie Pie.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Not exactly.
Starlight Glimmer,Maud! How did you get in here?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] This cavern's actually connected to mine.
Sunburst,"Uh, what are you doing?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Tapping.
Starlight Glimmer,"Maud isn't super chatty. I mean, you and I could sit around and talk all day, but she looks pretty busy."
Sunburst,Are you taking some kind of core sample?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Not exactly. I'm uncovering this section of strata for closer study. You might want to step back.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'm studying this area's metamorphic<U+0097>
Sunburst,"<U+0097>foliation. Is this gneiss, phyllite, or slate? Wow. The pressure above must be pretty uniform to get the planar fabric to be this consistent."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You know about geology?
Sunburst,"Eh, I dabble. For example, by the speleothems in this cave, I kind of figured there was another way out."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Because of the calcite deposits.
Twilight Sparkle,Starlight? Where's Sunburst?
Starlight Glimmer,"[mumbles ""I don't know""] Doing stage magic with Trixie? Studying new rocks with Maud? You're here, so I guess you two aren't off translating some ancient Olde Ponish text."
Twilight Sparkle,What are you talking about? Why would Sunburst be doing any of that? I thought he came to Ponyville to see you.
Starlight Glimmer,"I thought so, too, but it hasn't worked out that way. When we were foals, we had more in common than any two ponies in Equestria. But now, it seems like he's got more in common with my friends than he does with me."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh. Everypony changes, but that doesn't mean there aren't still things you both like. You both love magic, right?"
Starlight Glimmer,Magic?
Twilight Sparkle,"Sure. You're really good at it, and Sunburst practically knows every spell that ever was."
Starlight Glimmer,"[gasps] You're right! Thanks, Twilight! You're the best!"
Twilight Sparkle,Heh. I try.
Sunburst,"Starlight, what happened? Maud and I found some fascinating sedimentary stratum, but when I turned to show you, you were gone."
Starlight Glimmer,"Maud does have a way of making rocks really interesting, but I wanted to work on something a little more ""us""."
Sunburst,What's this?
Starlight Glimmer,Just a little something I made up.
Sunburst,Whoa! You made up this spell? Just now?
Starlight Glimmer,Yup!
Sunburst,Wow.
Starlight Glimmer,"I know, right? But wait, there's more!"
Young Starlight Glimmer,"Cool, right?!"
Young Sunburst,Um... sure.
Young Starlight Glimmer,Now we can play Dragon Pit! Just like we used to!
Young Sunburst,"Actually, I thought we could go with Maud and<U+0097>"
Young Starlight Glimmer,"I mean, nothing was better than just you and me playing this game when we were foals, right?"
Young Sunburst,Starlight.
Young Starlight Glimmer,Do you what to be red or blue?
Young Sunburst,Starlight! I don't want to play the game at all!
Twilight Sparkle,What's going on in here?
Starlight Glimmer,"Nothing. I was trying to have fun doing the one thing I thought we still had in common, but I guess we don't even have that anymore."
Sunburst,"I don't understand. Starlight and I have known each other since we were foals, but that doesn't mean we have to be foals to hang out."
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, Starlight does have a tendency to overdo."
Sunburst,"I mean, it is surprising how well I get along with all of her friends, but she and I still have tons in common."
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe you just need to remind her what those things are.
Sunburst,"That's it! That's exactly what I'll do! Uh, right after I think of them."
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-oh.
Trixie,Obviously you and I hit it off. I am quite impressive. And we share a love for prestidigitation.
Sunburst,"Right. And Starlight and I share a lot of things, too. I just need to think of them. What else do you guys have in common?"
Trixie,"Well, we've both made not-so-great choices in the past."
Trixie,"And we're self-conscious about everypony judging us, even though we've both changed and are trying hard to be better."
Sunburst,"Yeah, we don't really have that."
Trixie,Hmph! I can think of something you have in common. You're both poor practice audiences.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Starlight and I don't really have a lot in common. Other than feeling different from most ponies. And comedy.
Sunburst,Comedy?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'm very funny.
Sunburst,Was that a joke?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] No.
Sunburst,"Oh. Well, that's more than I can think of that she and I have in common."
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] We don't really spend that much time talking about that, though. Mostly we're just comfortable around each other."
Sunburst,"[sighs] We used to be. We did everything together. But now I'm wondering if we've spent so much time apart that we don't connect over anything anymore. And if we can't connect over anything, then maybe we're not even friends!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Well, at least it's not serious. That was a joke."
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] I appreciate you trying to help, Twilight. But it seems pretty clear that Sunburst and I have grown apart."
Twilight Sparkle,"I understand. But I feel like that only happens if you both let it. You still want to be friends, right?"
Starlight Glimmer,I created a spell so we could relive playing a game in our childhood home... and bodies.
Twilight Sparkle,Right...
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm just not sure Sunburst wants to stay friends, too."
Twilight Sparkle,I think you might be surprised.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Prepare yourself...
Trixie,...for the new and improved Dragon Pit!
Sunburst,"We had to take out a few spaces to get it to fit, but you hardly miss them. Maud made the dice."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Pumice is the lightest igneous rock. It seemed the best choice.
Trixie,And I added the special effects. There's nothing like a little well-placed magic smoke.
Twilight Sparkle,Looks like somepony's dragon is going to get trapped.
Starlight Glimmer,I thought you didn't want to play this game.
Sunburst,"Well, I didn't want to pretend to be a foal, but I know you wanted to play. I thought it'd be fun to play a version big enough for full-grown ponies. What do you think? Fun, right?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, it's missing something."
Starlight Glimmer,[giggles] Now it's fun.
Starlight Glimmer,I don't know why I got so worried about us not having anything in common.
Sunburst,Yeah. I kind of think it doesn't matter as long as we enjoy each other's company.
Trixie,And that game was certainly enjoyable.
Starlight Glimmer,What made it even better was getting to play it with all my friends.
Sunburst,See you soon?
Starlight Glimmer,You bet. I want to hear if you find anything interesting in that barrel.
Sunburst,"Trust me, Starlight. You'll be the first to know."
Star Swirl the Bearded,"[narrating] The best elements within us can spread light and virtue, and I know ponies who represent them all <U+0096> strength, bravery, healing, beauty, hope, and sorcery. Myself and these Pillars of Equestria were gathered together by another to maintain and share the light of these powerful ideals. But we soon came to believe the pony who brought us together only wanted that power for himself. Cast out and alone, this power-mad pony turned to darkness to satisfy his thirst. Transformed into a Pony of Shadows, he returned for revenge <U+0096> to extinguish the Pillars' light and rob the world of hope. To stop him, the Pillars and I must make a grave sacrifice. But we shall leave behind a seed in hopes that one day it will grow into a force to stand against the darkness for all time. We must now face the fiend with the only plan we have..."
Sunburst,"[reading] ""...I only hope it will be enough."" That's the last entry. And maybe Star Swirl's final words before he vanished."
Princess Celestia,"I've always wondered what happened to Star Swirl. This is quite a discovery, Sunburst."
Twilight Sparkle,So it's genuine? You can verify that this journal really belonged to Star Swirl the Bearded?!
Princess Luna,"Indeed. From the looks of it, the last thing he wrote before facing the Pony of Shadows."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh... So, the Pony of Shadows was really real?"
Princess Celestia,It appears so.
Princess Luna,"We never met the other Pillars, and we were too young to understand the danger they faced."
Applejack,"Hold on a second now. All those legendary ponies were real, too? And they went off with Star Swirl to face the Pony of Shadows, and then none of them were ever heard from again?"
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, yeah. Weren't you listening?"
Fluttershy,But what happened to them all?
Rarity,"They must have defeated the villain, since Equestria is still full of light and hope."
Starlight Glimmer,But how? And where did they go?
Princess Celestia,"My Olde Ponish is a bit rusty, but I wonder if the answers can be found somewhere within the pages of this book."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I just happen to be an expert in Olde Ponish. I mean, I've practically memorized every ancient text about Star Swirl there is!"
Spike,Seriously. All of them.
Princess Luna,"We have fond memories of our old teacher. If you could discover what happened to him, we would be most grateful."
Sunburst,Solving a thousands-year-old mystery could take forever! Think of the research! The re-reading! The re-re-reading!
Princess Celestia,You might find you need help.
Applejack,"Luckily, she's got a whole bushel o' helpers right here."
Rainbow Dash,"Totally! Uh... how long will all this research take, exactly?"
Twilight Sparkle,Let's get this back to my library. I'm sure we'll figure out what happened in no time.
Spike,"[yawns] Figure it out yet, Twilight?"
Sunburst,[yelps] What did you figure out?
Fluttershy,What is it?
Applejack,"Twilight, we've been studyin' and referencin' and cross-referencin' for three days straight now."
Rainbow Dash,Ugh. I haven't spent this much time reading since the last Daring Do book came out.
Rarity,"Perhaps it is time to take a break. This mystery is over a thousand years old, after all. Another day or two won't make a difference."
Twilight Sparkle,Two days?! I don't want to waste two seconds! I'm close to an answer. I can feel it.
Starlight Glimmer,"[reading] ""Hearg sylfum se Ponhenge"". What's that?"
Twilight Sparkle,The Temple of Ponhenge?! You can read that?!
Starlight Glimmer,"The hornwriting's pretty sloppy, but it's nowhere near as bad as mine. [reading] ""Toward dol grimlic of Fola Firgenbeorg""?"
Sunburst,"""At the base of Foal Mountain""..."
Starlight Glimmer,"[reading] ""User endemest scield""."
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] ""Our last stand""."
Twilight Sparkle,This is it. Ponhenge. I can't believe it.
Sunburst,I've never seen magical runes like these before! Have you?
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-uh.
Rainbow Dash,I don't think anypony's seen any of this for a long time. [straining] Whoa!
Applejack,It'd take a whole team of ponies to clear away all this brush.
Fluttershy,"Even then, I'm not sure we'd find out what happened here over a thousand years ago."
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] You're right. I suppose it was a long shot.
Spike,"Cheer up, Twilight. Finding a whole set of ancient ruins is pretty impressive. Maybe you could write a paper on it."
Twilight Sparkle,I guess I hoped we'd get here and the mystery would just magically be explained.
Spike,Uh... Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle,Star Swirl!? I... I've wanted to meet you my whole life! I can't believe you're here!
Sunburst,I don't think he is here. I don't think any of them are.
Pony of Shadows,[laughing evilly] Drawing me here will only make me stronger. You will never defeat me!
Star Swirl the Bearded,We did not come here to defeat you.
Pony of Shadows,What are you doing?!
Star Swirl the Bearded,We came... to contain you.
Pinkie Pie,"[to Twilight] Well, you did ask for a magical explanation."
Rainbow Dash,Uh... what just happened?
Starlight Glimmer,It looked like Star Swirl cast a spell that banished the Pony of Shadows.
Sunburst,Of course! Powerful magic like that would leave an impression on this place. Bringing the book back here let us see what happened.
Applejack,Which was what?
Twilight Sparkle,Star Swirl and the rest of the Pillars sacrificed themselves to save Equestria.
Starlight Glimmer,It's amazing to think one of the greatest mysteries of Equestria was solved with a musty old book from an antique shop.
Sunburst,But I wouldn't say the mystery's solved. Star Swirl's spell was one of the most powerful feats of magic in all of history. It'll take years of study before we fully understand it.
Twilight Sparkle,I think I understand Star Swirl's spell!
Twilight Sparkle,"I know I've finished one of Star Swirl's spells before, but this one was on a whole different level! Was it an explosion of magical feedback? An evocation? A kind of incantation? It's Star Swirl, so the possibilities are endless! And once Starlight set me on the right track with his crazy hornwriting <U+0096> [laughs, snorts] I mean, he was a genius, so I guess we can forgive a little messiness <U+0096> I went through the journal again, and it's amazing!"
Rarity,"Twilight, darling. We understand you're excited, but that's all we understand."
Rainbow Dash,What exactly is so amazing?
Twilight Sparkle,Only how Star Swirl and the other Pillars sent the Pony of Shadows to limbo!
Applejack,They did what now?
Twilight Sparkle,They used their magic to open a portal between worlds <U+0096> to limbo <U+0096> and pulled the Pony of Shadows inside.
Rarity,"Darling, your diorama!"
Twilight Sparkle,I made more!
Twilight Sparkle,Star Swirl thought the only way to trap the Pony of Shadows in limbo was for the Pillars to take him there.
Applejack,"So they got stuck, too!"
Fluttershy,The Pony of Shadows must have been really awful for them to do that.
Pinkie Pie,"I suppose being trapped for all time with a super-duper bad guy in limbo might be okay if you were doing the limbo, but that's still pushing it."
Twilight Sparkle,"The thing is, I think I can get them out."
Sunburst,"Twilight, are you serious? You can save the most legendary ponies of all time?"
Starlight Glimmer,I-I don't know. Opening portals between worlds didn't work out well for me. Are you sure it's safe?
Twilight Sparkle,"First of all, you opened portals through time. And second of all, Star Swirl wrote the spell you used to do it. If he'd been here, he could have stopped it. Equestria would be safer with him in it. We have to save him."
Applejack,"But you'd be savin' all the Pillars, right? A-And they disappeared ages ago."
Twilight Sparkle,"That's the thing about limbo. It isn't one place or another. It's in between, so time stands still. If we can pull them out, it'll be like they never left. I actually built another model to demonstrate<U+0097>"
Spike,What can we do to help?
Twilight Sparkle,"If I'm right, we need to find items that are connected to the Pillars in some way."
Rainbow Dash,"You mean, like, stuff that belonged to them?"
Fluttershy,How would we know what to look for? Or where?
Twilight Sparkle,"Luckily, Star Swirl took a lot of notes. [reading] ""My compatriots are as varied as the realm itself and hail from every corner of our land, bringing with them artifacts and talismans of great power."""
Starlight Glimmer,"Um, Twilight? What are you doing?"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm not doing anything!
Applejack,Rockhoof's shovel!
Rainbow Dash,Flash Magnus' shield!
Rarity,Mistmane's flower!
Fluttershy,Meadowbrook's mask!
Pinkie Pie,And the blindfold Somnambula wore when she faced that nasty sphinx!
Twilight Sparkle,I guess we don't need to figure out who should get what.
Petunia Paleo,Professor! It's a Mighty Helm headpiece! Maybe it belonged to Rockhoof himself!
Professor Fossil,Legends don't wear helmets. This belonged to a real pony.
Applejack,"Oh, I can guarantee Rockhoof was as real as you and me."
Professor Fossil,[chuckling] And I suppose that ravine was dug with his trusty shovel to save the village from an erupting volcano.
Applejack,Probably.
Professor Fossil,I love old legends as much as anypony. But a pony strong enough to save a village from rushing lava with a shovel is... preposterous.
Professor Fossil,I can't believe you just did that. Y-You saved us!
Applejack,"I bet if you told somepony else the story, it might sound... [gasps] ""preposterous""."
Professor Fossil,I suppose some stories might be true...
Professor Fossil,And Rockhoof's appears to be one of them.
Rarity,Ow!
Others,"""Lotus Petal"": You keep those hooves to yourself, dearie! This place has been in my family for generations, and I'm not about to let some whippersnapper take the last good piece of it! Time was, ponies came from far and wide to see these gardens. But that flower's the only worthwhile thing left!"
Rarity,Perhaps it just seemed like your gardens were worthless. But a little pruning can work wonders. Of course you will have to look after more than just one flower now.
Others,"""Lotus Petal"": You've given me back my family's legacy. The flower you wanted seems like a fair trade for that."
Rainbow Dash,I can't believe Flash Magnus' shield ended up in the Dragon Lands.
Spike,Good thing you brought the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons to help you navigate our customs. Like our favorite sport <U+0096> gorge surfing!
Maar,Wahoo! [whooping] Ollie!
Rainbow Dash,Okay. That was awesome.
Others,"""Billy"": Dragon Lord Ember commanded us to make peace with ponies, but it doesn't mean you can surf in our spot."
Spike,"Whoa, fellas. As the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I have to say that's not very friendly."
Garble,"Well, what do you know? The puny pony-dragon's sticking up for his pony pal."
Rainbow Dash,Hey! That's an ancient pony artifact!
Garble,"Hooves off my gorge board! I found it in the desert, and finders keepers."
Rainbow Dash,It isn't yours.
Garble,Huh. It sure looks like mine. But I might consider racing you for it.
Rainbow Dash,No problem.
Garble,Um... No. I mean [to Spike] you.
Dragon,Awesome!
Others,"""Billy"": On your marks... Get set... Surf!"
Spike,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaaa! Aaah! [grunting] [painting] I won? I won! Woo-hoo! Give up the shield, Garble!"
Garble,[grunts] Lord Ember only commanded us to be nice to ponies. She never said anything about pony-loving dragons.
Spike,"Uh, s-since Dragon Lord Ember commanded you to make peace with ponies, you can't very well attack one of their friends, can you?"
Garble,I guess we'll find out! [grunts] Aaah!
Garble,Ugh. Why is he always hiding behind ponies?
Spike,I wasn't hiding when I beat you down the ridge.
Garble,You fell.
Rainbow Dash,Wow. You must be slow if all Spike had to do to win was fall down.
Garble,I'm faster than you.
Rainbow Dash,Doubt it.
Garble,"Fine! I'll race you back to the top. If you win, you can have your pony junk. But if I win, you'll leave and I get to give it to him!"
Rainbow Dash,"Fine. I'm pretty sure I could beat you anyway. But with that heavy hunk of metal on your back, it'll be a snap."
Garble,"Huh? Oh, yeah. Thanks for the tip."
Garble,"See ya at the top, loser! Hey! That's mine!"
Spike,"Finders keepers, remember?"
Others,"""Billy"": See, because that's what you said to them when they first showed up<U+0097>"
Fluttershy,"Just remember not to turn away from them, Cattail. Flash bees can get pretty aggressive. I guess that's why none of the other bayou animals can get to the water."
Cattail,Wouldn't it make more sense for you to wear the mask that calms the bees?
Fluttershy,It would... if I didn't have to fly up here to move their hive. There!
Fluttershy,Now the other bayou creatures can get to the water without the bees feeling threatened.
Cattail,"You know, you didn't have to help with this. I would've lent you the mask anyway."
Fluttershy,I know. [giggles] But I couldn't leave without helping.
Others,"""Fahal Alkhayl"": I don't think anypony can find anything in there."
Daring Do,I wouldn't give up hope just yet.
Pinkie Pie,This old blindfold was stuck in the drain.
Daring Do,Weren't you looking for a blindfold?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, yeah!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I can't believe I'm gonna meet Star Swirl the Bearded! You know, outside of my dreams."
Starlight Glimmer,I can't believe you're actually going through with it.
Twilight Sparkle,What do you mean?
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm all for pushing the envelope, obviously, but this is pretty out there for you, Twilight."
Sunburst,"What's ""out there"" about saving the most legendary ponies of all time from a thousands-year-old prison?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Well... nothing when you say it like that. Unless ""the most legendary ponies of all time"" knew what they were doing, and we shouldn't mess with it."
Sunburst,"I'm sure Star Swirl and the Pillars did the best they could back then, but magic has come a long way. Mostly because of the work they did."
Starlight Glimmer,That's true. And you did get your wings from finishing one of Star Swirl's spells.
Twilight Sparkle,Exactly.
Starlight Glimmer,"But then I messed with one and nearly destroyed the universe, so..."
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, Star Swirl the Bearded is the greatest wizard who ever lived. The chance to have him back in Equestria is worth the risk."
Spike,That's good news.
Rainbow Dash,"Otherwise, we'd have brought this shield for nothing."
Applejack,"I hope you don't think you're the only one to find her artifact, because this here shovel says otherwise."
Rarity,"[laughing] Honestly, you two. Not everything is a competition. But Mistmane's flower is by far the most attractive of the artifacts."
Pinkie Pie,You're just saying that because you didn't have to scuba dive in a pit of green slime to get yours!
Fluttershy,Or move a flash beehive.
Twilight Sparkle,"Good work, everyone. Let's do this!"
Star Swirl the Bearded,What... What has happened?
Twilight Sparkle,It worked! We brought you back!
Star Swirl the Bearded,To where?
Twilight Sparkle,"You and the others have been trapped in limbo for over a thousand years, but I figured out how to get you ho<U+0097>"
Star Swirl the Bearded,"What?! No, no, no, no! You must undo what you've done!"
Twilight Sparkle,"What? Why? I mean, I don't think I can."
Star Swirl the Bearded,You cannot bring us back!
Twilight Sparkle,But I did. I brought all the Pillars back.
Star Swirl the Bearded,You cannot bring only the Pillars back!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, no!"
Sunburst,That's the last entry. Star Swirl's final words before he vanished.
Applejack,"All those legendary ponies were real, too? And then none of them were ever heard from again?"
Twilight Sparkle,They used their magic to open a portal to limbo.
Twilight Sparkle,We need to find items that are connected to the Pillars in some way.
Twilight Sparkle,We brought you back!
Star Swirl the Bearded,You cannot bring only the Pillars back!
Pony of Shadows,"[laughing evilly] Your pitiful attempt to imprison me has failed, Star Swirl!"
Star Swirl the Bearded,You must return us to limbo. It's the only way to stop him.
Twilight Sparkle,I only figured out how to bring you back.
Sunburst,Working on it! No table of contents!
Pony of Shadows,"There! Without the power of Ponhenge, your banishing spell is useless!"
Star Swirl the Bearded,You have studied my writings. Surely you have some other plan.
Twilight Sparkle,No. I just wanted to save you. I didn't think<U+0097>
Pony of Shadows,"Don't fret. When I extinguish the light and hope of this miserable world, you won't remember any of this."
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Starlight Glimmer,"Lucky for her, she's not alone!"
Pony of Shadows,[straining] Arrrrggghhhh!
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Know this, fiend! We will not rest until we find a way to return you to limbo!"
Pony of Shadows,"[growls] Never! Your days of glory are through, Star Swirl. Now my dark power will reign, and you six will bow to me!"
Rainbow Dash,Um... where'd he go?
Somnambula,That is a riddle we must unravel. And quickly.
Mage Meadowbrook,How long have we been gone?
Fluttershy,Over a thousand years.
Star Swirl the Bearded,Then my spell worked <U+0096> before it was meddled with <U+0096> and the realm has been at peace for a millennia!
Pinkie Pie,"Weeeeell... we did have to save everypony from Nightmare Moon and Discord and Chrysalis and King Sombra and Lord Tirek, and there was that one time when Starlight traveled through time and almost destroyed life as we know it! But that's all in the past."
Flash Magnus,"If you are truly this accomplished, we will stop the Pony of Shadows twice as fast together."
Star Swirl the Bearded,We shall see. It is an easy thing to say you have saved the world. It is quite another to do it.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, we've saved the world, Beardo. And we can do it again."
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Be that as it may, the problem of locating the Pony of Shadows remains, and this land is vast."
Rarity,"It sounds like you need a map. Luckily, we have just the thing."
Star Swirl the Bearded,Something about this magic seems familiar...
Rarity,Did you know he can do that?
Twilight Sparkle,He's Star Swirl! He can do anything!
Star Swirl the Bearded,"This map, and indeed this very castle, are grown from the seed we planted over a thousand years ago."
Rockhoof,Then it did work!
Sunburst,What worked?
Somnambula,Each of us infused a crystal seed with our magic in hopes that it would grow into a force for good.
Mistmane,"We wanted to leave something to protect the realm in our absence, but we never dreamed our gift would become so powerful."
Applejack,Y'all mean the Elements came from you?
Pinkie Pie,"You know, the sparkly crystal things that grow from the Tree of Harmony and represent each of us? Laughter, honesty, generosity, loyalty, kindness, and magic!"
Somnambula,"They are reflections of our own elements of hope, strength, beauty, bravery, healing, and sorcery."
Mage Meadowbrook,We had no idea our small seed would bloom into the living spirit of the land. I am glad our mantles have passed to such capable ponies.
Star Swirl the Bearded,"More importantly, we no longer need Ponhenge to send our foe back to limbo. We can use the stored magic in this Tree of Harmony."
Twilight Sparkle,But doesn't a banishing spell take a lot of power? We'd have to sacrifice the Elements for that.
Star Swirl the Bearded,Mm-hmm.
Fluttershy,They'd be gone... forever?
Twilight Sparkle,"Star Swirl, I don't think the Tree can survive without the Elements. If it dies, Equestria will suffer."
Star Swirl the Bearded,"If the Pony of Shadows has his way, your land will not exist. So unless you have a better idea..."
Star Swirl the Bearded,Our foe will seek dark places from which to draw power. I will prepare my spell so that we may strike as soon as you find him.
Rainbow Dash,What are we waiting for?
Flash Magnus,I like your spirit!
Spike,What about this one?
Twilight Sparkle,"Seapony etiquette isn't going to help right now, Spike."
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, Twilight? Are you okay?"
Twilight Sparkle,I just unleashed ultimate evil and doomed Equestria because I was obsessed with meeting my idol! Why wouldn't I be okay?!
Starlight Glimmer,[scoffs] You didn't know that was gonna happen.
Twilight Sparkle,But I should have listened to you and left things alone. Now the Elements of Harmony will be lost to fix my mistake!
Starlight Glimmer,Maybe there's another way.
Spike,"If there is, Twilight will find it."
Twilight Sparkle,"Portal gate... Portal keys... Portal spells... Yes! If the Pillars can hold open the gateway to limbo, a powerful pony can do the banishing spell herself! Do you know what this means?"
Spike,[panting] I can stop carrying books?
Twilight Sparkle,"The Pillars don't have to leave Equestria! Even though we'll lose the Elements, we'll have the ponies that created them. And the Pony of Shadows will be banished for good!"
Starlight Glimmer,That's great. Heh. But I was thinking of another way that maybe doesn't involve banishing at all?
Twilight Sparkle,"Star Swirl knew what he was doing when he cast that spell. If I can make it even better, maybe he'll see that I take magic as seriously as he does."
Rockhoof,It seems the dark places Star Swirl indicated on the map have changed.
Applejack,I bet the Pony of Shadows would've loved the Ghastly Caverns before a thousand years of erosion turned it into the Ghastly Gorge.
Fluttershy,The Appeloosian Wastes sure sounded dark and desolate.
Rarity,Who knew they would become such a popular square dancing destination?
Pinkie Pie,And I get how this part of Equestria used to be cast in eternal night where the Pony of Shadows could draw power and wreak havoc while ponies were powerless to stop him. But...
Pinkie Pie,[echoing] ...it's kinda made a comeback! Did I mention it's really bright?!
Star Swirl the Bearded,It seems there are fewer dark corners in the realm these days.
Rainbow Dash,Isn't that a good thing?
Flash Magnus,"True. The Pony of Shadows will have a hard time regaining power. When he rears his head, we'll be ready!"
Fluttershy,Isn't there some way to banish him without losing all of you?
Mage Meadowbrook,"Oh, I wish there were. But to save our home, we are willin' to leave it."
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't think you'll have to! My spell isn't finished yet, but I think we can send the Pony of Shadows to limbo without all of you having to go as well!"
Star Swirl the Bearded,"While I appreciate your enthusiasm, Twilight, this is hardly the time to take risks on half-baked spells."
Applejack,"Beggin' your pardon, Mr. the Bearded! But Twilight doesn't do anythin' halfway!"
Pinkie Pie,Especially not magic!
Rainbow Dash,Seriously! She got her wings by finishing one of your spells!
Rarity,I think you'll find her work is worth reading before you dismiss it out of hoof!
Fluttershy,Mm-hmm!
Mage Meadowbrook,"While it is an unconventional approach, I believe it could work."
Star Swirl the Bearded,Hmm. I suppose there is a chance.
Sunburst,But we still have no idea where to find the villain.
Spike,Maybe we should try there?
Applejack,The Hollow Shades. I think a branch of the Apple family lives there.
Sunburst,They'd have to be pretty distant. The Hollow Shades was abandoned eons ago.
Rarity,"Hmm, that's odd. The only time the map's called all of us to one place was Starlight's village."
Rainbow Dash,So it's like a super-villain tracker! No offense.
Twilight Sparkle,Do you think the map could be trying to tell us where the Pony of Shadows is?
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Hmm... The Tree of Harmony acting to protect the light of the realm... Yes. A good thought, Twilight."
Star Swirl the Bearded,I will make my notes on this spell. Ready yourselves for battle.
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, I know I'm not as experienced as all of you, but is banishment really the only option? I mean, it's been a long time. Maybe the Pony of Shadows is ready to talk?"
Star Swirl the Bearded,I doubt we can save our homeland with a conversation.
Starlight Glimmer,But we could try.
Twilight Sparkle,"Starlight, I'm sure Star Swirl and the others did try."
Star Swirl the Bearded,"The Pony of Shadows was not interested in reconciliation. Once a villain, always a villain. Twilight, Sunburst, would you accompany me? I wish to refine this spell for our use."
Rockhoof,Come. We must prepare for the struggle ahead.
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] I know Star Swirl is a great wizard, but this whole plan seems... wrong. The map's only ever sent us to solve friendship problems."
Spike,"Maybe so, but the Pony of Shadows doesn't really seem like the ""friendship"" type."
Starlight Glimmer,Honestly? We don't know anything about him.
Spike,"Well, nopony does."
Starlight Glimmer,That's not entirely true.
Starlight Glimmer,You all knew the Pony of Shadows before he became what he is now. You must've been friends. So what happened?
Rockhoof,The tale of our rift is a sad one.
Rockhoof,"[narrating] Stygian was a pony like the rest of us, though more scholar than hero. He recognized our emerging world would need champions to defend it."
Flash Magnus,"[narrating] He may have gathered us together, but he himself was just an ordinary unicorn who soon grew jealous of our abilities."
Mistmane,[narrating] He stole objects from each of us. Artifacts to use in a spell.
Mage Meadowbrook,[narrating] And we cast him out for it.
Somnambula,"[narrating] We always thought he'd return and seek forgiveness. But when we saw him again, his heart was bent on revenge. He dashed even my hope of saving him."
Starlight Glimmer,But why did he steal the artifacts from you?
Mage Meadowbrook,No doubt it was an enchantment to take our powers for himself.
Starlight Glimmer,Hmm...
Starlight Glimmer,That looks like a lot of work.
Star Swirl the Bearded,"It is what must be done, and it would be best if we were not disturbed."
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, Starlight, but we can't stop to talk. The stakes are too high, and we have to<U+0097>"
Starlight Glimmer,Banish Stygian to limbo. I get it.
Sunburst,"Uh, who?"
Star Swirl the Bearded,Stygian was the name the Pony of Shadows gave up when he turned to darkness.
Starlight Glimmer,And I'm just trying to figure out why.
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Envy. He wanted more power than he had, and that desire led him down a path from which there is no return!"
Starlight Glimmer,"I know from experience that's not always true. When the map called you six to my village, it was for a friendship problem. Are you sure this is different?"
Twilight Sparkle,I...
Star Swirl the Bearded,Stygian wants to destroy all that is good in this world. There's no way to befriend a pony like that.
Starlight Glimmer,"I guess I'm lucky your idol wasn't around when you decided to be my friend. I might've been banished to limbo, too."
Somnambula,I am glad we have the chance to see what has grown from our efforts so long ago.
Mistmane,It seems a shame to harm it.
Star Swirl the Bearded,"A necessary sacrifice. With the Elements' power, we will bind the Pony of Shadows in limbo. And thanks to Twilight, we will remain to watch over the realm ourselves."
Rockhoof,Um... how do we use them?
Rarity,"Well, you... Oh. I'm not sure. They simply work for us."
Star Swirl the Bearded,The Elements are attuned to you. We must use their magic in pairs.
Rainbow Dash,No problem. We're used to banishing evil before breakfast.
Applejack,And it'll be an honor to save Equestria with y'all.
Starlight Glimmer,I really hope Twilight knows what she's doing...
Sunburst,I don't remember reading anything that said the Hollow Shades was like this.
Mistmane,Ohhh. The Pony of Shadows must have twisted it to his purposes.
Star Swirl the Bearded,Prepare yourselves. He is here. Stygian! Show yourself and face us!
Sunburst,[groans] I definitely would've remembered reading about this.
Pony of Shadows,"[laughing maniacally] Welcome to the Well of Shade! When you turned your backs on me, I discovered this place. The darkness spoke to me of a power beyond any I could imagine, and I listened. The shadow and I became one. Soon, all of the realm will be the same. Then all ponies will feel the despair I did when you cast me out!"
Star Swirl the Bearded,We did what we had to do. You tried to steal our powers for yourself.
Pony of Shadows,No! It was you who were selfish! And now you will pay!
Starlight Glimmer,Are you still sure this isn't a friendship problem?
Star Swirl the Bearded,Ready? Open the portal...
Star Swirl the Bearded,...Now!
Pony of Shadows,No! You will not trap me again!
Star Swirl the Bearded,Twilight! Push him in!
Twilight Sparkle,Huh? There's... a pony in there.
Twilight Sparkle,Are you... Stygian?
Stygian,"I was, once. Until my friends betrayed me."
Twilight Sparkle,But Star Swirl says you betrayed them. You wanted their magic...
Stygian,"No! I wanted their respect. I brought them together. I planned strategy, and I read all I could about the beasts we faced. But I didn't have magic or strength, so nopony ever noticed me. I went to Ponhenge to make my own copies of the artifacts. With them, I thought I could be a Pillar, too, and stand by their side in battle. I never wanted to steal their power. But instead of sharing and letting me help, my friends threw me out. [voice deepening and growling] So I became stronger than any of them! The darkness welcomed me when no pony would, and I will do what I must to protect it!"
Twilight Sparkle,"This is all a misunderstanding! If the Pillars knew how you felt, I'm sure they wouldn't have turned their backs on you. The shadow isn't who you really are. Let me help you be Stygian again."
Stygian,"Even if my friends did still care, what makes you think you have the power to help me?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Because it's what she does. I wasn't so different from you, and Twilight helped me change. If there's one pony in Equestria that can save a friendship, it's her."
Stygian,I... I want to believe you... [growls] But the darkness will not be stopped!
Twilight Sparkle,"Fight the darkness, Stygian! You don't need it anymore! Revenge isn't what you want! Friendship is!"
Starlight Glimmer,Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ugh! The shadow won't let go of him. He wants to stop, but he can't do it alone."
Star Swirl the Bearded,Then we must help him!
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! Oh, it felt sooooo good to do that again!"
Pinkie Pie,Friendship power rush! Whoo!
Rarity,The Elements! They didn't disappear!
Fluttershy,Maybe because we used them for healing magic instead of banishing?
Applejack,Look!
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Long ago, you needed our help, Stygian. But instead of listening, we turned our backs on you. Pride clouded my judgment. I owe you an apology. Thank you for helping us see the errors of our ways, Twilight. It seems I never accounted for the Magic of Friendship."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you, Swirlstar! Uh, Star Swirl!"
Starlight Glimmer,[clears throat] Soooo... apparently a conversation can save Equestria?
Star Swirl the Bearded,[chuckles] Something tells me I will be making a lot of apologies today.
Star Swirl the Bearded,I simply cannot believe how tall you've gotten!
Princess Celestia,"Well, it has been over a thousand years. Will you stay here and teach magic once again? My sister and I have such fond memories of your lessons."
Princess Luna,As long as you don't ask for those essays we owed you before you disappeared.
Star Swirl the Bearded,"[chuckles] I'm not certain Canterlot is where I belong. The realm has grown, and I believe I'll have a look around before I settle in any one place."
Mage Meadowbrook,And I long to see what has become of my home.
Mistmane,I believe we all do.
Princess Celestia,Then I hope you will return to Canterlot on occasion and share the wisdom of your great experience with the next generation of ponies.
Star Swirl the Bearded,"We would be honored. But if it is wisdom you seek, look no further than your own pupil. She showed me that the power of friendship is a magical force indeed. And that in turning away from others, you hurt yourself as well."
Twilight Sparkle,"It's funny. I thought meeting my idol would give me all the answers I ever wanted. But instead, I forgot what I already knew. Good thing I had a student of my own to remind me."
Twilight Sparkle,This happened while we were gone?
Applejack,Wow! Those are all the places we went when we left to save Equestria!
Rarity,Ugh! There's that horrid town where we were almost sold!
Rainbow Dash,"The pirates! They were pretty awesome! Uh, once they decided not to throw us overboard."
Pinkie Pie,"And Mount Aris! Ooh, Starlight! Did you know we made seashell necklaces for aaaaaa... [inhales] ...aaaaall the seaponies?"
Starlight Glimmer,I... You... Really? What about that unicorn? The one who attacked Canterlot?
Twilight Sparkle,"Tempest! I invited her to come to Ponyville, but she wanted to spread the word of the Storm King's defeat and share what she learned about friendship."
Applejack,Y'all think that's why the map grew? Friendship quests beyond Equestria?
Fluttershy,"I hope not. I've had quite enough life-threatening adventures, thank you very much."
Pinkie Pie,How many friendship quests do you think we need to go on before we have to expand the throne room?
Twilight Sparkle,We can't do it all alone.
Pinkie Pie,"Sure we can! We just need to knock this wall down, get some paint..."
Twilight Sparkle,"No. I mean, the world is filled with so many different creatures who know nothing about friendship. We need help if we're gonna teach them all about friendship. Lots of help."
Rarity,Perhaps. But where does one go to learn about friendship?
Twilight Sparkle,Here! They can all go here! Because we're gonna open a school!
Princess Celestia,"I think a school of friendship is a wonderful idea, Twilight! I'll help in any way I can."
Twilight Sparkle,I just have a few questions. What time should school start each day?
Princess Celestia,It really d<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,What's the ideal length for class? Do you test regularly?
Princess Celestia,"Oh, well, that's<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,What about class projects?
Princess Celestia,That's a very<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,Assigned seating? Open seating? Or is that... too unstructured?
Princess Celestia,"[giggles] Oh, Twilight. You were my star pupil. If anyone knows how to run a school, it's you."
Twilight Sparkle,There's a big difference between attending a school and running one. It's not like there's a rule book to follow.
Princess Celestia,"Actually, there is. The EEA guidebook is very specific about how to run a school."
Twilight Sparkle,The EEA? I've never heard of that. Should I have heard of that?!
Princess Celestia,Of course not. You've never run a school before. The Equestria Education Association is a board of learned ponies that oversee every school in Equestria.
Spike,Even your school? But you're you!
Princess Celestia,"Not even a princess can do whatever she likes when it comes to shaping young pony minds. The EEA ensures that whether it's unicorns studying magic, Pegasi learning weather, or Earth ponies researching agriculture, all schools are held to the same high standard. They'll need to approve your plan before you can move forward."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, Spike, looks like we have a presentation to make."
Spike,"[scoffs] After everything we've been through, how hard can that be?"
Spike,"I'm gonna go with ""really hard""."
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, hello. My name is<U+0097>"
Neighsay,"Princess Twilight Sparkle. I am Chancellor Neighsay. Equestria owes you a great debt. But princess or no, we expect you to do things by... the... book!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I think you'll find my curriculum meets all your requirements, Chancellor."
Neighsay,"And can we trust you to follow through with this plan? Will you leave the school unattended to gallop off on your... ""adventures""?"
Twilight Sparkle,My journey beyond Equestria showed me firsthoof that the threats out there are greater than we imagined!
Twilight Sparkle,"If we want to keep our land safe and create a friendlier tomorrow, we need to teach the Magic of Friendship far and wide."
Neighsay,A school for ponies to learn how to protect themselves.
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, more like respecting differences and communicating."
Neighsay,"The EEA concurs. Every pony should be prepared to defend our way of life. So, if your work is in order, provisional EEA approval is granted. We will need to observe your school up and running before it can be fully accredited."
Twilight Sparkle,"Then please, join us for Friends and Family Day. It'll be the perfect time to see our progress!"
Rainbow Dash,It's too much. Too much!
Rarity,"Ugh, you think so? I had hoped dressing the part would help me feel the part."
Rainbow Dash,Not your dress! This! Us! Teaching?! They're gonna think I'm an egghead!
Pinkie Pie,"Well, the students are gonna love my confetti cannon class. It's gonna be... a blast!"
Fluttershy,"Um, hello there. I'm your teacher. I hope you enjoy class. But if you don't enjoy it, that's okay, too."
Applejack,I don't know about all this.
Twilight Sparkle,It's going to be fine. Everything about this school just feels right.
Starlight Glimmer,"See? If Twilight isn't stressed, you've got nothing to worry about."
Applejack,And you're sure you want us to be teachers? In classrooms?
Twilight Sparkle,"The EEA is very clear on how schools should be run. We have a huge responsibility, and I need you all to do this by the book. That means no cannons in class, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pie,Awww. Not even a [high-pitched] teeny cannon?
Twilight Sparkle,"I know it's not some big adventure against the forces of evil, but this could be the most important thing we've ever done. I can't run a school of friendship without my best friends. Can I count on you?"
Rarity,"Of course you can, darling."
Rainbow Dash,Call me Professor Egghead. I'm in!
Pinkie Pie,[screams] First day at school! So many new ponies!
Twilight Sparkle,About that. One thing I forgot to mention. It's not just ponies.
Pinkie Pie,That was unexpected.
Rarity,Ooh! Students certainly traveled from far and wide to attend our school!
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms. After all, friendship is something that needs to be shared with every... creature."
Twilight Sparkle,Welcome to the School of Friendship! I'm your headmare Twilight Sparkle. Please follow Guidance Counselor Starlight to sign in and get your class assignments. Then we can show you your living quarters.
Sandbar,"Whoa, sorry! I'm Sandbar. Are you a student here, too?"
Rainbow Dash,Grandpa Gruff? What are you doing here?
Grampa Gruff,Flew all the way from Griffonstone to introduce Gallus.
Gallus,"Rainbow Dash, right? Gilda told me about you. You're a teacher? Huh. Thought you'd be... cooler."
Prince Rutherford,Ponies!
Pinkie Pie,Prince Rutherford!
Prince Rutherford,This Yona Yak. She come to pony school. Hah. Make it better.
Yona,Yak can't wait to meet ponies and tell all about Yakyakistan!
Applejack,Why don't I show you around before you destroy the place?
Smolder,But dragons are better than this! Why am I here?
Ember,"Because as Dragon Lord, I'm ordering you to be here! Hey, Spike! Come meet Smolder."
Spike,"Great to see you, Ember! Uh, which one is Smolder?"
Thorax,Ocellus! What did we talk about?
Thorax,"I told you, stay in your own form. It's the polite thing to do. Sorry, she's shy."
Silverstream,What is that?! No way! I didn't know ponies could turn into... um... What are you?
Thorax,A changeling.
Silverstream,Ponies can turn into changelings?!
Fluttershy,"No, but changelings can turn into ponies."
Silverstream,Huh. That's confusing!
Seaspray,"I am General Seaspray of Her Majesty Queen Novo's navy. I would like to introduce the queen's niece, Silverstream."
Silverstream,"This place is amazing! I've spent most of my life in a coral reef underwater. I was a seapony, but now I'm a Hippogriff. Long story. Anyway, wow! Is that a yak?!"
Twilight Sparkle,Thank you so much for supporting the grand opening of our school. I hope you'll all join us for Friends and Family Day to see the amazing progress your students are making.
Twilight Sparkle,Looks like school's in session!
Choir,"The School of Friendship, first day of class Will we fail or will we pass? Students come from far and wide Brand-new friends here by our side"
Twilight Sparkle,"Take a breath, look around, it's amazing I can't believe that it's real Students galore, new ideas to explore Can't contain the excitement I feel"
Others,"Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now Think ""success"", keep it firmly in sight Make sure to do things by the book Make sure to do it all right"
Choir,"The School of Friendship, must get to class Will we fail or will we pass? Students learning from the best Taking notes to pass the test"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait, hold on! Not like that! Just a second! I'm not sure if that method's approved Let me take a look <U+0096> yup, right here in the book"
Rainbow Dash,Come on! We just got in the groove!
Twilight Sparkle,"Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now We are shaping young minds to ignite Do it like it says in the book Now make sure you're doing it right"
Pinkie Pie,There's not an equation on how to have fun
Fluttershy,"The students look bored now <U+0096> oh, what have I done?"
Applejack,"Can't teach bein' honest, not sure what to do"
Rarity,I'm quite certain I'm lost
Main cast sans Twilight Sparkle,None of us has a clue!
Students,"School of Friendship, another class Wish it were more of a blast Thought this school would be more fun Can't wait for our classes to be done"
Pinkie Pie,No way to have fun
Fluttershy,"Oh, what have I done?"
Students,"Listen to this one request Make things fun, we're really stressed"
Twilight Sparkle,Make sure to do things by the book now
All sans Twilight Sparkle,Can we tell her this thing is a mess?
Silverstream,Is this what boring is? Am I bored?
Smolder,"Ugh, please. These ponies are the heroes of Equestria?"
Sandbar,"Listen, these ponies saved all of us from the Storm King."
Gallus,How? By boring him into surrender?
Ocellus,Our teachers are a little different than I expected.
Yona,Ugh! Pony school waste of time! Yak school teach how to braid yak hair! Braiding yak hair is best! Whoa!
Smolder,Oof! Is there anything in Yakyakistan that isn't the best?
Yona,Yes! Wait. No! Yaks best.
Smolder,"No claws, no wings, no fire. What is it exactly you're proud of?"
Sandbar,"Whoa, cool it. No need to harsh Yona's love for her heritage, okay?"
Gallus,"Awww, are we not being sweet and friendly enough for you, pony?"
Silverstream,"That was sarcasm, right? Because you weren't being sweet or nice!"
Smolder,Maybe dragons and griffons are just too tough for friendship.
Yona,"Yaks tough, just not nasty."
Gallus,"Who you calling nasty, klutz?"
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, break it up! Break... it... up!"
Starlight Glimmer,What is going on here?!
Gallus,Just a friendly discussion about the magic of friendship amongst friends.
Applejack,"Everypony<U+0097> I mean, everyone, go to your next class! I just can't believe it. Fights breakin' out when they're supposed to be learnin' friendship?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Things definitely aren't going as ""by the book"" as Twilight planned."
Rainbow Dash,That's because we're terrible teachers! Face it. This school isn't gonna work.
Applejack,[fading in] ...fights breakin' out in the hallway...
Pinkie Pie,...putting myself to sleep!
Rainbow Dash,"I don't look like that, do I?"
Twilight Sparkle,I get it. Things are getting off to a rougher start than expected. But that's okay!
Spike,"Who are you, and what have you done with Twilight Sparkle?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Every school in Equestria follows these rules. As long as we do too, we'll be fine."
Starlight Glimmer,Maybe we should... try something new?
Twilight Sparkle,The EEA will be here this afternoon for Friends and Family Day. They need to see a school that follows their guidelines.
Fluttershy,Even if those guidelines aren't working?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, then we have to try harder and make sure they do."
Twilight Sparkle,"Another morning, another chance to inspire our students!"
Sandbar,Hey! Professor Dash's class is this way.
Ocellus,"Where are you going? You're not [gasps] skipping, are you?"
Smolder,That's exactly what we're doing.
Silverstream,But Friends and Family Day<U+0097>
Gallus,Is after class. Relax. This is just a quick... mental health break.
Silverstream,That sounds legit! We're in!
Sandbar,"I guess I'll tag along, too. Make sure you don't get into... trouble."
Fluttershy,"This way, Angel!"
Silverstream,Professor Fluttershy! We're busted!
Fluttershy,"Oh, my! What are you all doing? Aren't classes that way?"
Ocellus,"Ah<U+0097> [clears throat] A generosity field trip, daaaaarling. [giggles] I'm taking the students to the lake to look at our divine reflections."
Fluttershy,"Oh, that sounds nice. Have fun!"
Smolder,I take back everything I said about you! That was cool!
Ocellus,"Thanks! Wait, what did you say about me?"
Starlight Glimmer,You're sure sticking to the book is gonna work?
Twilight Sparkle,My friends can handle anything. They'll have these problems turned around before we know it.
Neighsay,Problems?
Twilight Sparkle,Chancellor Neighsay! You're here!
Neighsay,Yes. And you seem unprepared. If there are problems...
Twilight Sparkle,Problems? Ha! Of course not! We can't wait to show you around!
Gallus,And that's why griffons breathe fire when we get mad.
Silverstream,They do not! Wait! Do they? No! Really?!
Yona,Griffons just full of hot air!
Smolder,And yaks are actually good at jokes. How about that?
Ocellus,What are dragons good at?
Smolder,Competition! Who's up for a race?
Twilight Sparkle,Rainbow Dash! Why aren't you in class teaching?
Rainbow Dash,"Because my students are gone! Uh, g-gone somewhere else! Doing a loyalty lesson! And-and I was just going to grab, uh... this pencil! Because they need it. Wherever they are. Which I know, 'cause... I'm the teacher!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I see. [laughs nervously] Well, Chancellor, we have other classes. We can just<U+0097>"
Neighsay,Let's follow the professor. I'm quite curious about this lesson in loyalty.
Twilight Sparkle,"[voiceover] Of course, we want to instill a sense of loyalty towards others. We encourage acts of generosity and kindness."
Gallus,Figured we shouldn't be the only ones enjoying the view.
Yona,Waaaah! Yak not best at flying!
Twilight Sparkle,[voiceover] And appreciation for the value of laughter...
Yona,Flying is best!
Silverstream,"Congratulations, Yona! You are officially the weirdest thing I've seen so far!"
Smolder,"What do you say, Ocellus? Can you be weirder than a flying yak?"
Twilight Sparkle,...and to always be honest in any situation.
Neighsay,"Honesty is imperative. Princess, are we going in circles?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, look at the time! We'd better head to the lake for Friends and Family Day. I'm sure all the students and faculty will be there."
Ember,What is that?!
Neighsay,Aah! The school is under attack!
Pony,"Oh, my goodness!"
Silverstream,"Uh, maybe skipping class wasn't the best idea?"
Neighsay,How dare you! This act of aggression against ponies<U+0097>!
Twilight Sparkle,"I-I'm so sorry, Chancellor. We clearly had some students get a little carried away."
Neighsay,Those are students? But you said you were opening this school to protect Equestria! To defend ponies from... dangerous creatures who don't have our best interests at heart!
Twilight Sparkle,My school teaches for all of us to work together through friendship.
Neighsay,And how do you know these creatures won't take what they have learned here and use it against us?
Twilight Sparkle,Friendship isn't just for ponies!
Neighsay,It should be.
Prince Rutherford,Unicorn think yaks no need friendship? Maybe yaks no need pony school!
Neighsay,"Well, perhaps you should return to your kind."
Ember,"""Your kind""?! Smolder, let's go!"
Seaspray,Queen Novo will want to hear of this!
Grampa Gruff,"Well, this place seemed lame anyways."
Thorax,[despondently] It's fine. We know not every pony sees us the way you do. We're used to it.
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms! When she hears you closed the school because<U+0097>!
Neighsay,Because you failed to meet the EEA's standards?
Twilight Sparkle,What?!
Neighsay,"Irresponsible teachers, students skipping class, endangering ponies! Your school is a disaster. Perhaps if you had had higher standards for who was admitted, this could have been avoided. Regardless..."
Neighsay,"By order of the EEA, I am shutting this school... [stomps] down!"
Twilight Sparkle,This happened while we were gone?
Applejack,Friendship quests beyond Equestria?
Twilight Sparkle,We're gonna open a school!
Neighsay,We expect you to do things by... the... book!
Twilight Sparkle,"We have a huge responsibility, and I need you all to do this by the book."
Smolder,These ponies are the heroes of Equestria?
Gallus,This is just a quick... mental health break.
Neighsay,The school is under attack!
Neighsay,Those are students?
Neighsay,I am shutting this school... [stomps] down!
Spike,Twilight? You feeling okay?
Spike,"[sighs] Look on the bright side. Sure, the EEA closed your friendship school. But now you've got time to do other stuff! It's like being on vacation!"
Spike,Whoa!
Spike,"Okay, then. I'm gonna need backup. Operation Cheer-Up is a go!"
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Twilight! You can't sit around in the boring dark all day!"
Applejack,Exactly! What you need is a double dose of Granny Smith's apple mash.
Fluttershy,"Whenever I'm sad, a hug from Angel Bunny always makes me feel better."
Rarity,I find that nothing brightens my mood like a new ensemble!
Pinkie Pie,"[whispering, to Spike] You didn't tell me this was a pity party! I would've brought ice cream!"
Twilight Sparkle,"I appreciate you trying to make me feel better, but not everything can be fixed with dresses and cupcakes."
Pinkie Pie,What?!
Twilight Sparkle,I just need some time to be alone and think.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh...
Starlight Glimmer,I wondered how long you'd take to get tired of pillow-fort pouting.
Twilight Sparkle,Everypony's already tried to cheer me up. It won't work.
Starlight Glimmer,[short laugh] I'm not gonna cheer you up. I'm gonna tell you what you did wrong.
Twilight Sparkle,What?!
Starlight Glimmer,You gave up too easily.
Starlight Glimmer,"Hey, you made me a guidance counselor. That means tough love."
Twilight Sparkle,Neighsay was right. I failed. The school was a disaster.
Starlight Glimmer,"So was I when you met me. But you showed me that when you know in your heart something is right, you stand up for it. You did that for me. Why not for this?"
Twilight Sparkle,I can't go against the EEA! They're in charge of all the schools in Equestria!
Starlight Glimmer,And you're in charge of all the friendship in Equestria. Why should you let somepony else stop you from doing your job?
Twilight Sparkle,But the EEA rulebook<U+0097>
Starlight Glimmer,Doesn't matter! You can write your own rules! Because you are doing something new. Something important!
Twilight Sparkle,You're right! Why we're doing this is way more important than how we're doing this! And we are doing this!
Starlight Glimmer,"Now, that's the Twilight I know. How can I help?"
Twilight Sparkle,You already have.
Twilight Sparkle,Guess what? The School of Friendship is back in business!
Rainbow Dash,What?!
Rarity,But why?!
Fluttershy,"Oh, no."
Applejack,Bad idea.
Pinkie Pie,Do we still get to guess?
Rainbow Dash,"No offense, Twilight, but teaching at that school was the most boring, horrible, awful thing ever."
Applejack,"Uh, pretty sure she's gonna take offense to that."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, Rainbow Dash is right. I owe you all an apology. I was so focused on doing things the EEA way, I didn't listen to any of you. I'm sorry. I promise, this time, we'll run the school the way friends should <U+0096> together."
Rarity,So... we'd be allowed to teach however we want to?
Fluttershy,No more scary pop quizzes?
Pinkie Pie,Confetti cannons for everycreature?
Twilight Sparkle,Whatever you need to teach the Elements of Harmony.
Pinkie Pie,Yippeeeee!
Applejack,"Well, in that case, we're behind you one hundred percent, Twilight."
Spike,[clears throat] Just two small problems. The school is still unaccredited...
Spike,...and we don't have any students.
Twilight Sparkle,I'll take care of the first part if you five can round up our class.
Rainbow Dash,Totally! Uh... how?
Applejack,"Roundin' up the pony students ain't gonna be an issue, but..."
Fluttershy,The creatures from the other kingdoms seemed pretty upset with us.
Rarity,Pfft! Nonsense! I'm certain we can win them over with our charm and style!
Pinkie Pie,[singsongy] Cupcake-gram for Prince Rutherfoooord!
Prince Rutherford,Why pink pony here? Yaks mad at ponies!
Pinkie Pie,Because... you don't have to be mad anymore! We're reopening Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship! And it's gonna be super-uper-duper better than before! We're<U+0097>
Rarity,"<U+0097>ever so sorry about the misunderstanding. All creatures are, of course, welcome."
Fluttershy,We would be really happy if you sent your student back to class.
Applejack,It won't be the same without 'em. We're open and ready to start teachin'<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"<U+0097>right now! So, what are you waiting for? Get your student and let's go!"
Grampa Gruff,Not happenin'!
Grampa Gruff,"Listen, missy! It's not happenin' because<U+0097>"
Others,"Grampa Gruff, Ember, Prince Rutherford, Seaspray, [simultaneously] Our student is gone!"
Others,"Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, [simultaneously] What?!"
Prince Rutherford,Where Yona?! This all pony's fault!
Ember,"You're pretty quick to blame them! What are you hiding, yak?!"
Thorax,C-Can... Can we just focus on finding our lost students?
Grampa Gruff,Nice try! You grubs are probably hidin' the whole lot of 'em!
Princess Celestia,"Please, everycreature! If you can just explain what happened..."
Seaspray,"The students left us notes before they disappeared. When the school closed, they didn't want to say goodbye to each other. They claim they ran away to stay together."
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe it! They did learn friendship!
Twilight Sparkle,Sorry.
Seaspray,"The students couldn't have done this by themselves. Some creature is hiding them! If the niece of our queen is not found soon, I promise there will be retribution!"
Ember,"Yeah? Well, my dragons will burn every kingdom until we find which of you is hiding Smolder!"
Grampa Gruff,Tell it to the griffon army!
Prince Rutherford,Yaks fight griffons and dragons!
Thorax,The Changeling Empire can't afford an international incident. If any creature blames the changelings for this<U+0097>
Ember,"What are you up to, shapeshifter?!"
Thorax,B-But we're friends!
Princess Celestia,"Find the students quickly, Twilight, or I fear our world will be at war!"
Twilight Sparkle,Okay. Let's review what we know.
Spike,"Smolder, Ocellus, Silverstream, Yona, and Gallus disappeared together."
Spike,That's all we know.
Applejack,They're probably just off hidin' somewhere.
Starlight Glimmer,Unless they used some kind of spell to disappear.
Rainbow Dash,Ooh! Or went undercover!
Pinkie Pie,Maybe they were attacked by a ferocious shrimp! Nopony ever expects that!
Fluttershy,[gasps] Shrimps can attack?
Pinkie Pie,Nope! That's why nopony expects it.
Sandbar,Whoa!
Pinkie Pie,"Hi, Sandbar! Are you having a party?"
Sandbar,"[incredibly nervously] No! I'm just, um... really hungry? Yeah?"
Rarity,"We need to think like our students. If someone told us we would never see each other again, what would we do?"
Pinkie Pie,Go someplace we could all hang out and eat lots and lots of cupcakes!
Pinkie Pie,What?
Fluttershy,Sandbar was friends with all of the missing students... and he just got plenty of cupcakes.
Applejack,Huh. He was at the farm this mornin' pickin' up a wagonload of apples...
Rarity,And I saw him in a shop buying pillows and blankets!
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] He must be taking all that stuff to the other students! We've gotta follow him!
Gallus,[laughing] Huh. This place is way cooler than I thought it'd be.
Smolder,"[chewing] Even I'm impressed. What's it called again, Ocellus?"
Ocellus,"The Castle of the Two Sisters. I remembered it from class. Princess Twilight's ""History of Pre-Equestrian Friendships""."
Gallus,Huh. Who knew? School was actually good for something.
Yona,Yona not really like school. But Yona like new friends!
Smolder,[grunts] [strained] Smolder... like breathing!
Silverstream,"Hey, you guys! Sandbar's back!"
Yona,Cupcakes are best cakes!
Sandbar,Aah!
Sandbar,"[sighs] Thanks for the assist, Gallus."
Ocellus,Pillows! How nice! The castle is gonna be so much more comfy.
Smolder,And fun! Pillow fight!
Silverstream,You guys! I just found stairs!
Gallus,Aaaand we care because...?
Silverstream,"Stairs are awesome! We don't have anything like 'em underwater, 'cause you know, [magic zap] no way to climb 'em!"
Rest of students,Ohhhh.
Silverstream,This place has everything! If only my family back home could see it...
Ocellus,I wish the other changelings could meet you all. You're not nearly as strange as the stories say.
Smolder,"Gee, thanks. But yeah, hanging out with other creatures is actually... not bad."
Sandbar,"Uh, most other creatures. What is that thing?"
Ocellus,"[sighs] Am I the only one who didn't sleep through Professor Fluttershy's ""Critters of Comfort and Conflict"" class? It's a puckwudgie. Maybe I can make friends with it!"
Ocellus,Oops.
Smolder,"Think, Ocellus! Did Professor Fluttershy say anything about how to beat puckwudgies in her lecture?!"
Ocellus,"Uh... I'm sorry, I can't remember!"
Gallus,"I'm gonna go ahead and guess it's not pillows, apples<U+0097>"
Gallus,...or cupcakes.
Silverstream,Wouldn't class have been about how to make friends with them?
Sandbar,"Uh, guys? They're getting really close..."
Yona,Yona not scared! Yona have friends!
Gallus,Is that Professor Egghead?!
Spike,"Aw, yeah!"
Fluttershy,Oh! Don't hurt them! Just ask them to leave nicely.
Yona,Not bad! [quickly] For pony.
Ocellus,Wow! They're amazing!
Gallus,I had no idea our teachers were actually cool.
Sandbar,[chuckles] I've been trying to tell you!
Silverstream,"Did you see that?! Rainbow Dash was like voooooom and then werrrrr, and the puckwudgies went flying! And then the birds came and<U+0097>!"
Smolder,"Yeah, we all just lived it. But you're right. That was pretty amazing. Even by dragon standards."
Twilight Sparkle,Is everycreature alright?
Spike,[panting] You're lucky we got here in time!
Starlight Glimmer,"You know, this probably isn't the safest place for a campout."
Ocellus,Does that mean you're going to send us back to our homes?
Twilight Sparkle,Not exactly. We have another option in mind.
Gallus,We're listening.
Twilight Sparkle,It's pretty clear you've already started learning friendship without your teachers. But we'd like to show you even more... if you'd come back to school?
Smolder,Not much of a choice.
Applejack,"To be honest, we felt exactly the same way when Twilight told us she was reopening the school."
Rarity,"But this time, we guarantee it shall be different."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, yeah! With class run my way, it'll be two hundred and twenty percent cooler."
Fluttershy,And without the EEA<U+0097>
Fluttershy,<U+0097>it'll be much friendlier.
Pinkie Pie,"Plus, all your nations won't go to war if you come back with us! Bonus!"
Sandbar,Wait. What's happening?
Princess Celestia,Twilight! I was so relieved to get your letter!
Seaspray,"As was Queen Novo. Oh, we're just glad you're alright, Silverstream!"
Grampa Gruff,"[to Gallus] Don't expect a welcome party from me, sonny! It's time you got home!"
Gallus,I'm not leaving.
Grampa Gruff,Whaaaat?!
Ocellus,"None of us are. Sorry, Thorax."
Prince Rutherford,Yak not understand. This pony joke?
Smolder,No. We're going back to school.
Ember,How? You can't even get inside!
Twilight Sparkle,School is back in session!
Neighsay,Who dared remove my seal?
Twilight Sparkle,"I did, Chancellor Neighsay! And I respectfully ask you to step aside, or classes will start late."
Neighsay,"Classes won't start at all! The EEA has spoken, and none shall pass!"
Yona,Yak pass if yak say! Hmph!
Neighsay,"This is for the greater good. The school was disorganized, the teachers unqualified! And those dangerous and unpredictable ""students"" put ponies' lives in danger!"
Ember,[growls] I'll show you unpredictable!
Princess Celestia,"Hold on, please! I'm sure Princess Twilight Sparkle has a good explanation for all of this."
Twilight Sparkle,I do! It's true that my School of Friendship is EEA-unaccredited...
Spike,Look! She said it without doing the eye thing!
Neighsay,Then it is not a school!
Twilight Sparkle,It's not an EEA school. It's a friendship school with its own rules. I should know. I wrote the book!
Twilight Sparkle,"These students reminded me that every friendship is special, so the way we teach it has to be just as unique. My school is going to do things differently."
Neighsay,"Allowing all of these creatures to attend your school, changing the rules for them <U+0096> it simply won't work!"
Princess Celestia,"I seem to recall something about Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi doing something similar, don't you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I promise you, Chancellor. My school will help protect Equestria."
Neighsay,Or destroy it!
Grampa Gruff,Hmph. How is this school going to be any different from last time?
Twilight Sparkle,This brand new school of friendship Is home to everyone
Ocellus,We're learning how to trust
Gallus,We're here to all have fun
Rarity,With friendship ties that bind us
Applejack,Tighter than the strongest bonds
Fluttershy,We're hoof-in-hoof
All,In hand in hoof in wing or even claw
Twilight Sparkle,There's a griffon in the garden
Rainbow Dash,Hippogriffs hang in the hall
Spike,And the door will be open To all creatures great and small
Pinkie Pie,And a yak or two or three
Yaks,Sing in perfect harmony
Starlight Glimmer,That might have been a changeling
Fluttershy,But it kind of looks like me
All,This school of friendship is for all of us A place where we belong Where we all learn to share and trust The only rule here is to find your way And friendship always wins at the end of the day
Twilight Sparkle,Some things you just can't teach with books Some things you only know So trust your heart and let us lead And your friendship's sure to grow
Students,And once we master kindness We will spread it 'cross this land
All,And give the gift that's ours to share So others understand
Others,This school of friendship is for all of us A place where we belong Where we all learn to share and trust The only rule here is to find your way And friendship always wins at the end of the day!
Ember,"Ugh, fine! If you promise to stop singing, Smolder can stay!"
Smolder,Wahoo!
Prince Rutherford,"Uh, if dragon stay, yak stay."
Thorax,"I know you will make the changelings proud, Ocellus."
Seaspray,"You belong here. Now, can you show me those stair things you mentioned?"
Grampa Gruff,[to Gallus] What? You belong at home! You think I care if you've made friends?
Grampa Gruff,"Alright, alright! Stop doing that!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Guess I make a pretty good guidance counselor, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,Yes! Writing the rulebook was the most fun ever! I can't wait to start working on the new lesson plans!
Twilight Sparkle,...with some help from my friends.
Meadow Song,"Puh-leeeez put your hooves together for your next performer, Maud Pie!"
Maud Pie,[taps on microphone] [deadpan] What do you call an Alicorn with no wings and no horn?
Maud Pie,Earth pony.
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] But seriously, being an Earth pony isn't so bad. We've got magic powers, too. Like walking around and picking stuff up with our teeth."
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] That's sarcasm, by the way."
Pinkie Pie,"[laughs] It's funny, 'cause it's true!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] My favorite thing to listen to is clastic rock <U+0096> the accumulation of sediments over millennia forming to create sandstone, shale, and breccia. It sounds something like this."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] And that's my time.
Pinkie Pie,"[laughs] Isn't my sister Maud the most hilarious, entertaining, amazing comedian ever?"
Pinkie Pie,"Your jokes, your hilarious delivery, your... your everything!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] How was my... timing?
Pinkie Pie,"[laughing] You got me! C'mon, let's celebrate sister-style. We can get matching stickers that says ""Eyes on the Pies"", then show them off at the Ponyville Sticker Convention that I could plan for tomorrow if you want."
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Actually, I'm busy tonight."
Pinkie Pie,"Aww, that's what you said yesterday. And the day before that. And the day before the day before that. [sighs] It's just, we haven't hung out in a really long time because you always have other plans. Even when you promised to build whipped-cream pyramids with me."
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] I know. I am sorry, Pinkie. The reason is I have a<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,"Apology accepted, as long as we get some serious sister time before your birthday. And there's, uh, definitely no reason I wanna hang out before your birthday. Just, you know, not planning anything special."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Okay.
Pinkie Pie,What about tomorrow morning?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Okay.
Pinkie Pie,Yay! Just you and me. Best sister friends forever!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Best sister friends forever.
Pinkie Pie,"[continues squealing] Tomorrow is today! Who's ready for some fun times at Sugarcube Corner? The answer is ""you""! I would also accept ""Maud"". Maud? Maud!"
Pinkie Pie,"[gasps] Oh, I get it! We're playing hide-and-go-seek!"
Pinkie Pie,Aha! Found you!
Pinkie Pie,"Where's Maud? I've already tried Discord's dimension, Granny Smith's wax museum, and Yakyakistan! She has to be here!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Nope, it's just me. Reading."
Pinkie Pie,Story checks out. Or does it?! It does. But are you sure there's nopony hiding... in your closet?!
Starlight Glimmer,"Pinkie, I don't have a closet. Is everything okay?"
Pinkie Pie,No. I was supposed to go birthday cake shopping with Maud today.
Starlight Glimmer,And ruin her surprise party?
Pinkie Pie,"I wasn't gonna tell her why, silly. But now I can't even find Maud. I'm usually way better at hide-and-seek than this."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, she probably just found a new rock formation and forgot you two were gonna hang out. Tell ya what. You take care of the cake, and I'll look for Maud."
Pinkie Pie,"Really? Thanks, Starlight!"
Pinkie Pie,Just checking.
Pinkie Pie,[whispering] I've gotta get very important ingredients for a very important pony's cake. And it's gotta be tippy-top super-duper secret.
Mudbriar,"Technically, it's not your turn yet."
Pinkie Pie,Oh. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to cut in front of anypony.
Pinkie Pie,"Um, whatcha doin'?"
Mudbriar,I am currently speaking to a pony at a baking supply shop two minutes before it closes for lunch.
Pinkie Pie,"Rrrrrright. Okay. Just that I'm trying to plan a party here, and the clock is ticking, while you, uh... What are you doing anyway?"
Mudbriar,I am currently speaking to a<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"I mean, can I help you move this along? What are you looking for? Rolling pins, cupcake tins, cookie cutters with tails and fins?"
Mudbriar,[to S06E12 Unnamed Unicorn Mare #3] Goodbye.
Pinkie Pie,That's what you've been standing here all this time to say?
Mudbriar,"I was deciding between ""goodbye"" and ""see you later""."
Pinkie Pie,"Uh... but, they're the same thing."
Mudbriar,"Technically, they're very different. ""See you later"" implies an event in the near future wherein we see each other. ""Goodbye"" expresses good wishes where parting or at the end of a conversation."
Pinkie Pie,"Yyyyyeah, same thing."
Mudbriar,I will not apologize for speaking with precision.
Pinkie Pie,"In that case, apology not accepted. Goodbye, later, see ya<U+0097>same thing!"
Pinkie Pie,"Ugh! Can you believe that guy?! Huh? ""Out to Lunch""?! Oh, come on!"
Pinkie Pie,"[groans] No Maud, no cake, no anything! And how annoying was that pony? Who takes so long to say goodbye? Or was it ""see ya later""? Ugh! Now he's got me doing it!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Hello, Pinkie Pie."
Pinkie Pie,Maud! Found you! My turn to hide! Hee-hee!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I'm sorry I wasn't around this morning.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, pssh. What are you apologizing to me for? I'm not upset, you silly-willy."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] The reason is I met somepony<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"Wanna hang out right now? I mean, I can see you're not doing anything with anypony else. Unless they're invisible or reeeeeaaaally small."
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Pinkie, the reason I've been so busy is that I have a boyfriend now."
Pinkie Pie,A wha...?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] A boyfriend.
Pinkie Pie,A whaaa...?!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] A boyfriend.
Pinkie Pie,A whaaaaa...?!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] A boyfriend.
Pinkie Pie,"That's so exciting! My sister, in love!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Technically, we're in ""like""."
Pinkie Pie,"Tell me everything! Who is he? What's his favorite color? Does he like ice cream? If he were a bird, what kind of bird would he be? Wait. Is he actually a bird? Oh! I don't know, because you haven't told me anything yet!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You'll like him. We have a lot in common.
Pinkie Pie,"Well, I love you, so I know I'm gonna love your boyfriend! Oh, I can't wait to meet him!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You don't have to.
Pinkie Pie,"[gasps] He's a rock! And you love rocks, so it's perfect! [gasps] Is Boulder jealous?"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] No. Behind the rock. Mudbriar, are you back there?"
Mudbriar,"Technically, not anymore."
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] A wha-whaaaaaaaaa?!
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] Pinkie Pie, meet Mudbriar."
Mudbriar,"Technically, we've already met."
Pinkie Pie,You?!
Mudbriar,M'yes.
Pinkie Pie,You?
Mudbriar,M'yes.
Pinkie Pie,You...
Mudbriar,M'yes.
Pinkie Pie,"I mean, [laughs] you! You, you, you!"
Mudbriar,M'yes. M'yes. M'yes.
Pinkie Pie,"I'm sorry. Let's start over. Hi, I'm Maud's sister, Pinkie Pie."
Mudbriar,I know.
Pinkie Pie,Sooooo... how did... you two meet?
Maud Pie,[deadpan] At a rock show.
Pinkie Pie,"Oh! You're into rocks, too?"
Mudbriar,No. I like sticks.
Pinkie Pie,Then why were you at a rock show?
Mudbriar,"It was a petrified wood show, which technically makes it a stick show."
Maud Pie,"[deadpanly happy] Except that in the per-mineralization process of petrification, all organic material is replaced with silicates <U+0096> i.e., rocks."
Mudbriar,"While retaining the original structural elements of wood <U+0096> q.e.d., it was a stick show."
Pinkie Pie,"I'm... really into sticks, too! They're great for hitting pi<f1>atas! Haaaaa..."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Pinkie...
Pinkie Pie,Oh! You wanna go first?
Mudbriar,That is stick abuse.
Pinkie Pie,"It is? I'm sorry. Oh, this is awful. I'm not being a very good sister. Let's start over. I'm Pinkie Pie! Nice to meet you!"
Mudbriar,"Technically, we've already met."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You should introduce Pinkie to your pet.
Pinkie Pie,Oh! Your pet likes fetch!
Mudbriar,This is my pet. So no.
Maud Pie,[deadpanly happy] Aw. Look at Twiggy and Boulder playing together.
Mudbriar,They're adorable.
Pinkie Pie,"[whispering, to Maud] It's just a stick."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Don't be rude.
Pinkie Pie,"[sighs] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. One more time. [through gritted teeth] I'm Pinkie Pie! Nice to meet you!"
Mudbriar,"Technically, we've already met."
Pinkie Pie,[straining] Daaah! I don't get this guy!
Starlight Glimmer,Wow. Maud has a boyfriend?
Pinkie Pie,[groans] How could she like someone so weird? He has an inanimate object for a pet!
Starlight Glimmer,So does Maud.
Pinkie Pie,"Boulder has ten times the personality of some random stick! Mudbriar, too, for that matter. He's not like Maud at all! Maud is hilarious, friendly, caring, and easy to talk to!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Yep, that's Maud."
Pinkie Pie,"But this guy is awkward, quiet, and kind of... strange."
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, that also sounds like Maud."
Pinkie Pie,"[laughs] You're so funny, Starlight! Maud is nothing like Mudbriar. If she were, then we wouldn't be best sister friends forever."
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, Maud obviously likes something about him."
Starlight Glimmer,Maybe you just need to spend more time with him. Find out what you have in common.
Pinkie Pie,That's easy <U+0096> nothing!
Starlight Glimmer,You both care about Maud. I know. He could help you with her party.
Pinkie Pie,I guess...
Starlight Glimmer,And I'll keep Maud busy while you and Mudbriar plan the best surprise birthday ever.
Pinkie Pie,That I can do!
Pinkie Pie,"Listen. Maud's birthday is tomorrow, and there's no time to waste. You're not afraid of slides, are you?"
Mudbriar,No. Whyyyyyyyyyyy??!
Mudbriar,Oof!
Pinkie Pie,No reason. Wheeeeeee!
Pinkie Pie,Welcome to my party planning cave!
Mudbriar,"Technically, due to the speleothems growing from the ceiling, this is more of a cavern than a cave. Maud taught me that."
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, okay."
Pinkie Pie,"Here's what I'm thinking for her surprise party <U+0096> edible rock candy plates, gem-shaped ice cubes, a pebble pi<f1>ata. Uh... we'll skip that one."
Mudbriar,Might I make some suggestions?
Pinkie Pie,Oh. Suggest away! That's why you're here! You and me! Planning... together! Friends!
Mudbriar,"I have a vision board of everything Maud loves, and none of those things are on it."
Pinkie Pie,"Hmph. Let me see this ""vision board""."
Mudbriar,"It's not a physical thing. I'm envisioning it. [quietly] Om, I enter through the large door of my mind palace and enter to the back, where I have all of my books and possessions, and what do I encounter? The Maud Room. None of those things are there. [out loud] Just as I thought. Maud doesn't like surprises."
Pinkie Pie,Where does it say that? She never told me that!
Mudbriar,Mmm. It sounds like she was protecting your feelings. She's very caring that way.
Pinkie Pie,Stop acting like you know my sister better than me!
Mudbriar,"Technically, I never said that."
Pinkie Pie,"[angrily] Well, technically, I don't care! And since I've been best sister friends forever with Maud my entire life, I think I'm the expert here! Oh, but fine. If you don't believe me, let's ask her! [whispering] But we have to be super-sneaky."
Mudbriar,Can you be more specific?
Pinkie Pie,No!
Starlight Glimmer,Huh. You must be Mudbriar.
Starlight Glimmer,I'm Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you. I've heard great things!
Starlight Glimmer,I'm so glad the two of you are spending time together. So... how's it going?
Pinkie Pie,"Mudbriar and I have just spent the best time bonding! And we're really starting to make some headway becoming besties, except for one teensy-weensy disagreement that maybe you could settle, Maud. See, Mudbriar here seems to think that [starting to laugh] you don't like surprise parties! Isn't it funny how [suddenly angry] wrong he is?!"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I like surprise parties...
Pinkie Pie,Hmmmm.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] ...because I know they make you happy when you throw them for me.
Pinkie Pie,"See? Wait, what?!"
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] I'd rather just do something small with you, Starlight, Boulder, and Mudbriar for my birthday."
Pinkie Pie,No party? No party?! Did he put you up to this?!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Mm-mm.
Pinkie Pie,"[whispering] Maybe you should consider, I don't know, taking things a little less serious with Mudbriar because he's kinda sort of... [loudly] impossible to like?!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Hey, Mudbriar, have you ever flown a kite? Let me tell you all about it. See, the first thing you should do is<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,I just can't believe you would choose sitting around with him over a party with your own sister!
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] I didn't choose either of you. Technically, I said I wanted to be with both of you."
Pinkie Pie,"[gasps] ""Technically""?! Ugh, you even like the way he talks?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Everything about him makes me happy.
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] [tearing up] Then I guess you don't need a best sister friend forever anymore.
Maud Pie,[deadpanly concerned] Pinkie...
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, wait, let's all slow down and talk about this."
Mudbriar,See you later!
Pinkie Pie,[crying] I don't understand! How could Maud like Mudbriar? Is it Opposite Day? Nothing makes sense!
Fluttershy's apparition,"Fluttershy' I'm not shy, and I hate animals!"
Rarity's apparition,"Rarity' Fashion?! Not for me, darling!"
Applejack's apparition,Applejack' Peh! An apple a day is downright disgusting!
Rainbow Dash's apparition,Rainbow Dash' Slow and steady wins the race!
Twilight Sparkle's apparition,Twilight Sparkle' I never learned to read!
Limestone Pie,"Get out of bed, sis. If you're gonna be here, you gotta work."
Pinkie Pie,Ohhh.
Pinkie Pie,You're probably wondering why I came back to the family farm in the middle of the night.
Marble Pie,Mm-hmm.
Pinkie Pie,"Well, it all started when<U+0097>"
Limestone Pie,"Less talking, more farming!"
Pinkie Pie,[sad groan] It's just... Maud has a boyfriend.
Limestone Pie,I'm not jealous! Who said anything about jealous?!
Limestone Pie,"Buck up, Pinkie Pie. You look as miserable as I feel all the time."
Pinkie Pie,"It's just that I love Maud, and I want to love Mudbriar, but I can't see anything to like about him!"
Limestone Pie,"Ugh, fine! We're taking a work break. Come on!"
Limestone Pie,I'm looking at a sparkling bright blue and white rock. See it?
Pinkie Pie,You mean that lumpy grey one?
Limestone Pie,"No, the beautiful blue and white one. Right there."
Pinkie Pie,"I would not describe that as beautiful, blue, or white, but... [laughs nervously] Okay."
Limestone Pie,[to Marble] Show her.
Limestone Pie,"It's a geode! The outside looks like a regular rock, but the inside is filled with beautiful gems."
Pinkie Pie,"So you're saying I should crack open Mudbriar like a rock! It all makes sense! No, wait. It doesn't."
Limestone Pie,"It's a metaphor, Pinkie! You see Mudbriar as a rock, but Maud sees him as a gem. Even if you never see past his dullness, you can see how happy he makes Maud. And to a sister, that's all that matters."
Marble Pie,Mm-hmm!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, Limestone, Marble, thank you! I don't know what I'd do without you two! Pie pile!"
Limestone Pie,"Okay, okay! You're crushing me to gravel, Pinkie!"
Pinkie Pie,I really owe Mudbriar an apology. [gasps] And I owe Maud a party! I just hope I'm not too late!
Pinkie Pie,"I brought you an olive branch to say sorry. I was really unfair to you, and I'm ready to listen to your ideas for Maud's birthday, if you still want to plan it together."
Mudbriar,"Technically, this isn't even an olive branch. It's a quercus, most likely castaneifolia."
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, come on! [through gritted teeth] Sorry! Keeping it together...!"
Mudbriar,And I love a good quercus. Friends?
Pinkie Pie,"Friends! Now, do you have any ideas for the party?"
Mudbriar,There is one.
Crowd,Surprise!
Background pony 1,"Can you believe this punch? Oh, it's so good!"
Background pony 2,Another great party!
Background pony 3,I know!
Background pony 4,Yeah!
Maud Pie,[deadpanly happy] This is my favorite party ever.
Pinkie Pie,It was all your amazing boyfriend's idea. He said the best present would be me throwing you a surprise party you didn't have to go to.
Mudbriar,"Technically, it wasn't a surprise because she could see the pre-party preparations from up here."
Pinkie Pie,[through gritted teeth] Technically... [normally] You're right!
Fluttershy,"Don't worry, Angel, I won't forget you."
Fluttershy,[sighs] There's nothing so peaceful as a cuddly friends picnic.
Rarity,Fluttershy!
Fluttershy,"Oh, goodness, Rarity! What's the matter?"
Rarity,"Oh, the better question would be, ""What isn't the matter?"""
Fluttershy,"Oh, dear. Do you wanna have some lettuce and talk about it?"
Rarity,"Uh... Oh! I would love to, darling, but I just don't have the time. The Canterlot Royal Fashion Show is practically upon us, and the cornerstone piece of my collection just isn't working!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, that sounds serious."
Rarity,"Oh-ho-ho, it's serious. The entire collection is designed around it!"
Fluttershy,Do you need help knitting? I've started making tea cozies. It's an elephant.
Rarity,"Yes, well, I don't need help making clothes. Sassy Saddles is pitching in. Plus, I'll be pulling all three of my Manehattan assistants."
Fluttershy,All three? Does that mean you'll have to close Rarity For You?
Rarity,"That's just it, darling. This is Manehattan's busiest shopping season, and I can't just close the shop. So I was hoping... you might consider running it?"
Fluttershy,Of course. I'm happy to help. Though I'm surprised you picked me.
Rarity,"Well, I may have asked a few others."
Rainbow Dash,"Sorry, but we've got a Wonderbolts show coming up."
Pinkie Pie,"Sorry, but it's pie season and the pie orders are piling up."
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, I've got a curriculum to make up."
Applejack,Nope.
Big McIntosh,Nnnope.
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] My calendar's packed, but I hear Fluttershy's free. And you haven't asked Boulder."
Rarity,Uh... Oh?
Rarity,"[chuckles] It doesn't matter who else I asked, because I couldn't be happier that you agreed to help!"
Fluttershy,I think I forgot how big this shop was. How do you find anything?
Rarity,"Oh, darling, it's easy to track. The store is divided into sections <U+0096> chic, classic, modern, sophisticated, avant-garde, traditional, and obtuse. And, of course, each section is divided by season, color, and price. It's a classic SCP system. Then it's just a little ringing ponies up..."
Rarity,"...a little fluff and fold... Voil<e0>! But, of course, that's the easy part."
Fluttershy,[gasps] It is?
Rarity,"Mm-hmm. As you well know, the real focus at Rarity For You is on the customer!"
Rarity,Care to give it a try?
Fluttershy,"Um, okay. [quietly] Hello. Um, welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?"
Pursey Pink,I need something classic but modern. Something with drama but also understated.
Fluttershy,"Um, aren't all those things opposites?"
Pursey Pink,Yes. So?
Fluttershy,But how can I<U+0097>?
Pursey Pink,I'm sorry. Are you asking me how to do your job?
Fluttershy,"No! But I just, um<U+0097>"
Rarity,"If I may, I'm thinking noir-esque minimalist but with a twist. Perhaps a tapered hem."
Rarity,"Hmm. The inseams say, ""Yes!"""
Fluttershy,Wow. You make it look so easy.
Rarity,"Oh, darling, come now. You've conquered your shyness a thousand times over. You can't let a few fashion ponies undo all that progress."
Fluttershy,I guess not.
Rarity,You simply must access your inner strength and allow it to shine through!
Fluttershy,How?
Rarity,"Uh, daily affirmations? Meditation? Ooh! Power posing works wonders whenever I feel intimidated. Try these. Confident warrior! Gold medalist! Showpony!"
Rarity,[clears throat] Or... not.
Blue Bobbin,We need to leave now if we're going to catch the train to Canterlot.
Rarity,"Oh, goodness, look at the time! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, go, go! I'm right behind you!"
Fluttershy,You're not gonna be here? In your work room?
Rarity,"But, darling, I simply can't. The fashion show is in Canterlot tomorrow, and I'll be up all night, even with the help of all of my assistants!"
Rarity,"Well, not all my assistants."
Fluttershy,Smoky! Softpad! Smoky Jr.!
Rarity,"Ever since you convinced me to let them live in the shop, these beastie sweeties have been nothing but helpful."
Fluttershy,And I'm sure they'll help me let my inner strength shine through!
Rarity,"Oh, I wish I could stay and offer more help. [gasps] Why not try a new outfit? Think of it as the costume for your role as... Shop Pony! Ha ha! You know what they say <U+0096> ""clothes make the pony""."
Fluttershy,"Um, who says that?"
Rarity,"You know, ""them"". All right. I'm sure you and your furry friends will do just fine. Ta-ta!"
Fluttershy,[sighs] I hope she's right.
Fluttershy,Whew. Here goes nothing.
Fluttershy,Welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?
Bracer Britches,What's the thread count of this shirt? I can't be seen in anything less than a thousand.
Fluttershy,"Um, thread... count? Um... Well, I'm not sure. Let's see... Um, one, two, three, four..."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I'm afraid I don't know much about fashion to satisfy these customers. What am I gonna do?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, I've never tried to act before, but... I suppose it's worth a shot."
Fluttershy,"[clears throat, snooty voice] Severe but not unapproachable. Acceptable business attire. [normal voice] Oh, does that sound like a shop pony to you?"
Fluttershy,[snooty voice] So sorry for the wait. The shop has some... staffing issues today.
Bracer Britches,"Yes, well, I still haven't had an answer on this thread count."
Fluttershy,"Here at Rarity For You, our merchandise defies typical attempts to quantify its quality, but rest assured, it will make you the envy of all who see it."
Bracer Britches,"Oh, in that case, I'll take three!"
Fluttershy,Ta-ta!
Fluttershy,"[normal voice, sighs, faints, pants, sighs] Smoky Jr., I can't believe it worked! [snooty voice] I suppose clothes really do make the pony after all."
Luckette,"I don't know about you, but I have a full day of shopping planned. And if even one shop pony isn't up to my standards, well, I shall make my displeasure quite plain."
Bracer Britches,Rarity?
Rarity,"Oh, darling, I'm afraid I can't stop. Potential emergency at the boutique."
Bracer Britches,"Oh, well, whatever it is, I'm quite certain the pony you left in charge can handle it. Oh, she's simply divine!"
Rarity,"Oh, well, I always knew Fluttershy had it in her. [laughs] And there's still time to catch the train to Canterlot!"
Fluttershy,[snooty voice] It's an unique play on the old standard. We call it a Rarity cut with a triple-cut stitched hem and a guacamole chevka pattern fabric.
Silver Berry,"Don't you mean ""chevron""?"
Fluttershy,"If I had meant ""chevron"", then that's what I would've said."
Silver Berry,[chuckles] Of course. It's so unique! So en vogue! It must be mine!
Fluttershy,"[normal voice] Aw, thanks, everyone. But I feel I should push the snootiness further."
Fluttershy,"If you really wanna help, I suppose serving tea would be nice. Oh, if you don't mind."
Old Money,"I like my accessories bold and shiny, and I'm just not seeing anything nearly bold and shiny enough."
Fluttershy,[snooty voice] I'm afraid bold and shiny won't work with your whole... modelle. Perhaps... pointy.
Old Money,Pointy? Yes! I must have pointy!
Fluttershy,"Not everypony can pull off a found object, but you... nearly get there."
Valley Trend,"[millennial accent] I need, like, a red carpet glitz-and-glamour gown that's also casual, but, like, still artsy and a total head-turner."
Fluttershy,Yes. Casual chic pr<ea>t-<e0>-porter is very branch<e9> this season.
Valley Trend,"Uhhh... Like, I don't understand any of that, so, like... I don't care about it?"
Fluttershy,"Um, one moment, please."
Fluttershy,"[normal voice] Oh, I think I need a new character."
Fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Okay, I've got, like, this high-key savage look for you? It's a totally live ensemble with a little, like, thingies that sparkle and make the whole squad go, ""Whoa! That pony is 'woke'!"""
Valley Trend,"That is, like, exactly what I need!"
Others,"""Snow Hope"": This store is a desperate wasteland of nothingness. Do you have anything in black?"
Fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Can you, like, chill for one sec? BRB."
Fluttershy,"[goth voice] It's not like the futility of shopping can be made better with black leather and metal studs, but they help."
Others,"""Snow Hope"": Uh.... that jacket completes me."
Joan Pommelway,"[spits] [British accent] This tea's, like, lukewarm. It's barely drinkable."
Fluttershy,[snooty voice] This tea must always be at a precise temperature! See that it doesn't happen again!
Fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Whoa, that color is, like, almost too lit for you? [goth voice] The blackness of this vest is a reflection of your soul. [snooty voice] This hemline is nothing short of an inspiration of craftsponyship. Are you sure you deserve it?"
Fluttershy,[snooty voice] I don't know what's worse <U+0096> that you spilled the tea or that it's still cold! Either get it right or go back to the forest!
Fluttershy,"Oh, it is so hard to find good help these days."
Spike,"Okay! Okay! Slow down, everyone! I'm doing my best!"
Spike,"So, Rarity is busy at an important fashion show, and Fluttershy is running her shop in Manehattan, but to do it, she's playing different shop pony characters that are all mean?"
Twilight Sparkle,"How in the world did you figure that out, Spike?"
Spike,I'm not Dragon Charades champion for nothin'!
Twilight Sparkle,"I can't imagine Fluttershy would ever be mean to her animal friends. This sounds serious. Spike, tell everyone it's time to head back to Saddle Row!"
Fluttershy,"[snooty voice] I wouldn't think it was possible to make something so dowdy even more matronly, but here you are. [goth voice] It's like a scream in the void, empty and ultimately meaningless. [hipster voice] I would srsly help you right now, but, like, I don't wanna, you know?"
Twilight Sparkle,You weren't kidding. This is worse than we thought! She's being horrible to everypony!
Applejack,"Uh, are you sure that's even Fluttershy?"
Pinkie Pie,"Maybe it's just three really, really fast ponies that really, really look like her!"
Rainbow Dash,"Well, let's find out! Hey, Fluttershy? Are you running the shop or performing in a one-pony show?"
Fluttershy,"[snooty voice] If you don't mind, I can only improve the taste of one customer at a time. You'll have to wait your turn. Ugh, honestly! These small town ponies come to the big city and think they can behave any way they please!"
Rainbow Dash,What?! You are a small-town pony! And your cottage isn't even in the town!
Applejack,"Look, Fluttershy, we came here because we were worried and we care about you."
Fluttershy,"[goth voice, to Neigh Sayer] Let's get out of this aura of positivity before it consumes us."
Pinkie Pie,"As fun as this Fluttershy switcheroo game is, Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad are really concerned."
Spike,Yeah! They came all the way to Ponyville to get us.
Fluttershy,"[hipster voice] They should have, like, stayed there? The shop is, like, a no-rodent zone now."
Pinkie Pie,"She called them ""rodents""?!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, I understand why you think you have to act this way for these customers, but there's gotta be a better way."
Fluttershy,"[snooty voice] [sarcastically] Goodness! You are so right. Please, step this way so that we may discuss your concerns."
Twilight Sparkle,I knew you'd come to your senses!
Fluttershy,[snooty voice] Indeed.
Rarity,"Ugh, the centerpiece of my collection, and it's still not right! Oh, darling, I'm afraid we've literally run out of time. It's up to you! Go out there and sell it! Now, attitude!"
Rarity,"I don't understand. When I left Fluttershy, she had everything well in hoof."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, things might have seemed all right when you left, but they're definitely not all right now."
Applejack,She's actin' worse than the worst Manehattanite I ever saw!
Rainbow Dash,She kicked us out of the shop!
Pinkie Pie,"She called Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad... ""rodents""!"
Rarity,"Wh-wh-wha... Rodents?! Well, why didn't you say that from the start?! She obviously needs help! Come on!"
Fluttershy,[goth voice] Your melancholy is way too shallow for a look with this much unfeeling depth.
Others,"""Snow Hope"": Huh."
Fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Ugh! Your style isn't even on the same page? Turn away. Don't even look at it, okay?"
Valley Trend,[gasps] I can't even!
Fluttershy,"[snooty voice] I think not, dear! This is all far too fashion forward for the likes of you!"
Bracer Britches,"Ugh! Well, I never!"
Applejack,[sighs] Told ya it was bad.
Rarity,Bad? This is worse than I could've possibly imagined!
Fluttershy,"[snooty voice] Rarity! I'm so glad you're here! [kissing noises] Finally, a pony who understands that the couture in this shop is far too brilliant to even consider selling!"
Rarity,Whaaat?!
Fluttershy,"[hipster voice] You, like, totally get how lame customers are? Ugh! [goth voice] Watching them leave filled me with a sweet sadness. [snooty voice] And you'll be pleased to hear that I've taken care of your rodent situation."
Pinkie Pie,Will somebody tell her to stop saying that?!
Rarity,"That's it! Fluttershy, I'm afraid you've left me no choice! You are terminated!"
Fluttershy,[snooty voice] Well! Good luck replacing me! Humph!
Fluttershy,[goth voice] I always thought she was too controlling.
Rarity,"You<U+0097> you<U+0097> you are terminated, too!"
Fluttershy,[goth voice] Whatever.
Fluttershy,"[hipster voice] I know, right? I mean, uh, ugh?"
Rarity,"Actually, you're, like, totally terminated as well!"
Fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Like, okay."
Fluttershy,[normal voice] I guess I owe everypony an apology.
Rarity,[sighs] You think?
Fluttershy,I got so caught up trying to please all of your customers that<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,What customers?
Fluttershy,I might have taken my salespony characters a little too far.
Fluttershy,"[to raccoons] I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You know I was only pretending, right?"
Twilight Sparkle,"But, Fluttershy, why did you think you needed to be somepony else to run the shop?"
Fluttershy,I guess acting like the ponies of Saddle Row gave me the confidence to interact with them.
Rarity,"Darling, I'd never trust some horrible Saddle Row pony to run my shop. That's why I wanted a friend to do it."
Fluttershy,"Well, I'd definitely rather be myself anyway, even if I don't exactly have what it takes to be a shop pony."
Twilight Sparkle,I wouldn't sell yourself short. Those salespony characters all came from you!
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! I think you totally have what it takes.
Pinkie Pie,Maybe a little too much.
Rarity,"Indeed. You have all the inner strength you need, but I think we prefer it coming from our sweet, regular Fluttershy."
Rarity,And that's just given me the inspiration I'm looking for!
Rarity,And last one... There! The missing piece for my new collection <U+0096> the Warrior of Inner Strength!
Pony,"Oh, gorgeous!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, it's lovely, Rarity! I'm just sorry you had to leave the Canterlot Royal Fashion Show early."
Rarity,"Oh, darling, making the perfect dress is scads more satisfying than showing it off."
Blueberry Curls,"Ooh, striking dress, Rarity. I certainly hope you aren't trying to undercut the Royal Fashion Show by ducking out and debuting it here."
Rarity,"What? No, I<U+0097>"
Fluttershy,[snooty voice] Have you considered the possibility that the Royal Fashion Show is trying to undercut Rarity's by continuing on in Canterlot and not moving the whole affair here?! Hmm?! Have you?! Hmmm?!
Blueberry Curls,"I, uh... No."
Fluttershy,[snooty voice] Hmph! Just as I thought! Hmmm!
Fluttershy,[to Rarity] Oh! [giggles] Inner strength.
Soarin,"I'm sooo glad I made it to Las Pegasus before the fastest, most thrilling ride of all time closes for good!"
Rainbow Dash,"Wait. The fastest, most thrilling ride of all time?"
Misty Fly,[gasps] She hasn't heard of the Wild Blue Yonder?
Rainbow Dash,"[scoffs] Of course I have! It's that one where, uh... All right, you got me. What is it?"
Soarin,Only the coolest rollercoaster ever!
Misty Fly,[scoffs] You can't really call yourself a Wonderbolt if you haven't been on it.
Rainbow Dash,It looks incredible!
Soarin,"Oh, it is. First, you strap yourself into the cloud rocket car, and then you're catapulted straight through a..."
Rainbow Dash,...series of daring dips and terrifying turns...
Rainbow Dash,...flipping upside-down so many times you don't know which way is up!
Rainbow Dash,'Til finally you climb to the highest peak on the rails! Then drop towards the ground at lightning speed...
Rainbow Dash,...before coming up to a screeching halt! It's the coolest ride ever to exist in the history of Equestria!
Applejack,"So, when did you ride it?"
Rainbow Dash,Oh. [laughs] I haven't.
Rainbow Dash,The ride closes this week! Forever! But I can't go to Las Pegasus because I have to teach at Twilight's school. I'm gonna miss out on the coolest rollercoaster of all time! Unless...
Applejack,Why do I feel like you're about to ask me a mighty big favor?
Applejack,Absolutely!
Applejack,On one condition. You tag along with a few other ponies goin' to Las Pegasus.
Rainbow Dash,[laughs] Surely you don't mean Granny Smith!
Applejack,"No, no, of course not. I mean Granny Smith and the rest of the Gold Horseshoe Gals."
Granny Smith,"Hurry your haunches, hinnies!"
Applejack,"Grand Auntie Applesauce, cousin Apple Rose, and cousin Goldie Delicious."
Applejack,"Why, I'm sure they'd be plumb tickled to have you join their annual grandmares' trip to Las Pegasus. It'll be perfect. I'll teach your classes, and you can look after them for me."
Rainbow Dash,[scoffs] Look after them?
Applejack,"So they don't get too carried away. Usually Big Mac goes along as a chaperone, but I'm sure he'd love a break."
Rainbow Dash,"There is no way I'm going to Las Pegasus with a bunch of old, slow grannies!"
Applejack,So you don't mind missin' your only chance to ride the Wild Blue Yonder?
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, fine! I'll go!"
Applejack,Ha! That's the spirit! Now skedaddle so I can help them get ready.
Granny Smith,Applejack! Have you seen my cranky flank cream? I can't find it in this whole tootin' farmhouse.
Applejack,"It's, uh, gonna take a while."
Rainbow Dash,[groaning] Why is this taking so long? The Wild Blue Yonder's gonna close before we even get to Las Pegasus.
Applejack,Here. I made a list to help you keep the grandmares out of trouble. Don't wanna have to bring 'em back home before you get to go on your rollercoaster.
Rainbow Dash,That could happen?!
Applejack,"Only if you don't follow the rules. These grannies need a lot of care. If one of 'em overdoes it, it's bye-bye Las Pegasus for the lot of ya."
Rainbow Dash,"[reading] ""Make sure they get their naps"". ""Eat only soft foods"". ""Careful when dancing""? ""Don't get too excited""? Seriously?!"
Applejack,And don't let 'em out of your sight. Ever.
Rainbow Dash,Wait. Then how am I supposed to go on the rollercoaster?
Applejack,You'll find time. And you might even learn a thing or two about havin' a good time from these old gals.
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. That'll happen.
Applejack,"All right, y'all! Time to get this show on the road! [chuckles] Or in the sky, in this case."
Rainbow Dash,"[groans] Come on, come on, come on!"
Rainbow Dash,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
Rainbow Dash,Argh! Everypony okay in there?
Granny Smith,Dandy as a pansy in a plant pot!
Apple Rose,"You know, this hot air balloon ride reminds me of the time I climbed a tree. Have I ever told you that story?"
Auntie Applesauce,Only about a million times.
Apple Rose,Huh? What did you say?
Rainbow Dash,[echoing] They said they've heard the tree story!
Apple Rose,"Oh, you wanna hear the tree story? Okay."
Goldie Delicious,Here we go again.
Rainbow Dash,"The Wild Blue Yonder is in our hotel?! Uh, I bet you grannies are feeling super tired from your journey."
Granny Smith,"Nope! How about a trot down the avenue to see the sights, girls?"
Goldie Delicious,"Oh, forget the sights! I came here to play some serious horseshoe toss!"
Apple Rose,"Oh, can we see the rainbow fountains at the water show? They're so magical!"
Auntie Applesauce,My pores are crying for a mud mask at the Prism Palace Spa!
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! There it is! The best rollercoaster ever!
Goldie Delicious,"Aaah! Warm up those withers, ladies! There's a horseshoe-hurlin' trophy with our names on it!"
Applejack vision,[ghostly voice] Don't let them get too excited! Or you'll have to go hooooooome!
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. That sounds a little too exciting. Why don't we get you checked in first?
Auntie Applesauce,"Oh, my. You are a strong pony. Aren't you, sugarhocks?"
Others,"""Luggage Cart"": Welcome to our Gold Horseshoe Suite. Only the best of the best for our favorite guests. Which, of course, means you lovely mares."
Auntie Applesauce,"Why, thank you a bushel and a peck, you scrumptious morsel of frosted carrot cake."
Others,"""Luggage Cart"": Oh. [chuckles] Thank you, ma'am."
Auntie Applesauce,I think he was sweet on me. Maybe I should ask him to accompany me to the magic show tonight.
Granny Smith,"Ha-ha! You sure your name's not Applesaucey? Better find the brakes on that buggy, sugar. We just got here."
Auntie Applesauce,"You're right. Better see what else is out there first. The day is young, and I am not!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, Granny Smith's right. Let's not overdo it. How about a nice nap so you can really enjoy Las Pegasus?"
Goldie Delicious,"[yawns] Good idea. We could use some shut-eye, hmm?"
Apple Rose,"But I'm not tired. Uh, oh, right! Uh, yaaaawn."
Granny Smith,"You go along now and explore while we rest, sugar booger. Yawn."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, if you say so! [to Lemon Squeezy] What? They'll be in here sleeping the whole time I'm gone!"
Rainbow Dash,Quit judging me!
Rainbow Dash,"[clears throat] One ticket for the coolest rollercoaster of all time, please. [gasps] But... But... this line never ends!"
Others,"""Cranberry Muffin"": I know, right? Good thing we can just stand here all day without any responsibilities waiting for us!"
Others,"""Cranberry Muffin"": Oh, hey, thanks!"
Rainbow Dash,Enjoy the ride.
Rainbow Dash,Heh. They didn't even know I left.
Rainbow Dash,Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Aah! [gasps] They're gone!
Rainbow Dash,"[panicked whimpering] Granny Smith! Apple Rose! Are you here?! Applesauce? Goldie? Oh, I'm the worst chaperone ever!"
Applejack vision,[ghostly voice] Don't let them out of your siiiiiiiiight!
Rainbow Dash,"I know, I know! Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a group of old mares around here?"
Others,"""Tight End"": Lady, you just described half the ponies in this place."
Rainbow Dash,[groans] This place is huge! They could be anywhere!
Crowd,[chanting] Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie!
Carnival Barker,"Can they do it? Can good old Goldie Delicious and the Gold Horseshoe Gals break the all-time resort record, folks?"
Goldie Delicious,Now that's how you hurl a horseshoe!
Rainbow Dash,Ha! No way! Goldie's totally got game!
Carnival Barker,"Make some noise for the best-played game of horseshoes this resort has ever seen! Can you believe your eyes, folks?"
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! Go, Goldie!"
Carnival Barker,Stand back! She's getting excited!
Rainbow Dash,Huh? Uh-oh!
Goldie Delicious,"Oh, oop!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, mind if I try?"
Rainbow Dash,Whoops. Guess I'm no good at this game. Sorry.
Carnival Barker,"And the Gold Horseshoe Gals are out! Looks like the show's over, everypony."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, I'm so glad I found you! Everypony feeling okay? Not too excited?"
Goldie Delicious,Pretty much the opposite right now.
Rainbow Dash,"[sighs] Good. From now on, I'm not letting you grannies out of my sight."
Auntie Applesauce,"In that case, let's paint the town candy apple red!"
Goldie Delicious,Ooh! We could play more games!
Granny Smith,That's what we ought to do!
Rainbow Dash,Really?
Granny Smith,Hit the buffet! All that horseshoe tossin' sure works up an appy-tite.
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] Uh-huh...
Granny Smith,I love me some nachos. I'mma set my dentures loose on these vittles until the crumbs cry uncle!
Applejack vision,[ghostly voice] They can only eat soft foods! You're a nacho away from no rolly-coaster!
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Granny. You know you can't have those. They're super crunchy."
Rainbow Dash,"How about some nice soft carrot soup, instead?"
Granny Smith,I thought you was supposed to be the fun one.
Rainbow Dash,Wait. I am fun!
Carnival Barker,"[over P.A.] Attention all, thrill-seekers! There's only one day left to ride the ride of all rides, the Wild Blue Yonder, before it's gone for good! Get in line! Now!"
Auntie Applesauce,I'd rather hit the club and show off my dance moves. I'm quite a legend when it comes to rumba.
Rainbow Dash,Sounds kind of intense. Aren't you all exhausted from your big day?
Goldie Delicious,"Heck no! We save up our energy all year for Las Pegasus weekend, isn't that right, girls?"
Others,"Auntie Applesauce, Apple Rose, Mmm-hmm!"
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh. Dancing it is, then. I'll be there."
Applejack vision,[ghostly voice] Careful when daaaaaanciiiiing!
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh! Stop doing that! Uh, that's probably enough dancing for now! Right, Apple Rose?"
Apple Rose,"Oh, that was just my warm-up."
Auntie Applesauce,"Look! It's our favorite magicians, Big Bucks and Jack Pot! And aren't they lookin' handsome as ever?"
Jack Pot,"[laughs, ahem] You little fillies have got some smooth moves!"
Big Bucks,"Say, how would you Gold Horseshoe Gals like to bring some of that good energy into our magic show tonight?"
Jack Pot,"Here's five complimentary VIP tickets to our most amazing trick in the Ponet Fantastique Theater, just over there."
Auntie Applesauce,"Sugarcube, we never miss your show."
Jack Pot,Fabulous. We'll save a spot for you on stage.
Big Bucks,And in our hearts.
Rainbow Dash,So gross.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, come on! You said you were going back to the room after dancing! So each pony could have some alone time?"
Goldie Delicious,"Oh, now don't be a stick in the mud! Trust me, you'll loooove this show! It's the best thing in Las Pegasus!"
Others,"""Cranberry Muffin"": Oh, hey! Thanks for giving me your place in line. They said I'm one of the last ponies ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder! Ha!"
Big Bucks,"And now, for the trick that made us famous!"
Jack Pot,The most dangerous magical feat known to ponykind.
Jack Pot,We'd like to invite some very special mares to the stage.
Auntie Applesauce,"That's our cue, girls!"
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, where are you going? Come back!"
Big Bucks,Meet our lovely assistants!
Jack Pot,They will make a splashtastic escape using only the instructions we give them... with our minds.
Big Bucks,"Don't try this at home, folks!"
Applejack vision,[normal voice] Do I really have to say anything?
Rainbow Dash,"Release those grannies, right now!"
Granny Smith,What'd ya go and do that for?! That was our big star moment!
Rainbow Dash,Y-You were in danger! I saw the water! You were trapped!
Goldie Delicious,"Oh, pish-tosh! This is a magic show! We've seen it a thousand times! Everypony always escapes."
Big Bucks,"Uh, that's right, folks! Because of our, um, skill as magicians!"
Jack Pot,"And now, a disappearing act!"
Auntie Applesauce,"Well, I hope you're happy! We've been waiting to be picked as the lovely assistants in that trick for years!"
Goldie Delicious,You keep ruinin' our fun! I had a hot hoof goin' in that game you decided to lose for us!
Granny Smith,And I wanted to eat those nachos at the buffet!
Apple Rose,And I could have torn up the dance floor if you didn't keep stopping me!
Granny Smith,"They're bein' too polite to say it, so I will! Rainbow Dash, we thought you'd be a hoot, but I ain't never met a wetter hen!"
Rainbow Dash,What?!
Goldie Delicious,She's right! You've had your mane in a twist ever since we arrived!
Apple Rose,"Is something the matter, dear?"
Rainbow Dash,"I'm so sorry, everypony. The truth is, all I wanted to do for this whole trip is ride the Wild Blue Yonder. I mean, it's why I came to Las Pegasus in the first place! Applejack told me not to let you out of my sight, or you might overdo it and we'd have to go home early."
Auntie Applesauce,Applejack put you up to this?
Rainbow Dash,"Well, now it's too late. I ruined your trip, and it's the last day ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder! The line is so long, I'll never get to go on it."
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, what's so funny?"
Granny Smith,[chuckling] Is that all you wanted?
Goldie Delicious,"Well, fish-flavored kitten kibble. Why didn't you say so sooner? Come on, girls!"
Granny Smith,We're Gold Horseshoe members. The most exclusive club in Las Pegasus. And she's with us.
Goldie Delicious,We've been comin' here every moon since we can remember. Even some we don't remember.
Auntie Applesauce,It definitely has its perks.
Rainbow Dash,Like fancy suites and rollercoaster rides?
Apple Rose,That's right. And I hope you like riding in the front.
Rainbow Dash,"Um, yes! [squeals] This is amazing! Isn't this amazing?"
Granny Smith,"Sugar, you probably want to hold on 'bout now."
Rainbow Dash,I'm sorry I misjudged you for being older ponies. You mares are actually pretty cool.
Granny Smith,Rainbow Dash?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, Granny?"
Rainbow Dash,Ha-ha! Really?
Grannies,Mm-hmm.
Auntie Applesauce,Same time next year?
Rainbow Dash,I wouldn't miss it for anything!
Scootaloo,Princess Twilight!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,We're glowing!
Twilight Sparkle,[giggling] That's what happens when you're summoned by the Map.
Sweetie Belle,Somepony needs our help?
Apple Bloom,We're being called by the Map?
Scootaloo,Did I mention we're glowing?!
Scootaloo,So where exactly in Equestria are we needed?
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, where you're going isn't even in Equestria."
Sweetie Belle,Wow! That's almost... off the table!
Apple Bloom,But what's way out there?
Twilight Sparkle,"Mount Aris, the home of the Hippogriffs! And that's where you're headed!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Whoa...!
Sweetie Belle,"You really don't need to come with us, Twilight. We can take care of this mission just fine on our own."
Apple Bloom,Mm-hmm.
Scootaloo,Yeah!
Scootaloo,Oof!
Sweetie Belle,Ugh!
Twilight Sparkle,"I know that. But I'm not so sure the ponies who care about you want you going off so far on your own. Besides, there's some school business I need to take care of on Mount Aris. This permission slip is for Silverstream. It's very important that her mother and father sign it, or else no field trips."
Scootaloo,"[whispering, to Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle] Sounds like somepony just wants a vacation."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, yes, I have been wanting to visit Mount Aris ever since the Hippogriffs moved back. But it's purely research. Silverstream's brother is gonna meet us there and take us to their houses."
Apple Bloom,Wow! They have more than one house?
Twilight Sparkle,I guess so. The social structure of the Hippogriffs and seaponies is a bit of a mystery.
Others,"""All Aboard"": All aboard! Last stop <U+0096> the new Mount Aris Station!"
Sweetie Belle,"I don't know if I'd like being a Hippogriff. Part bird, part pony..."
Scootaloo,"I'm happy with just my pony parts, thanks."
Apple Bloom,"I think Hippogriffs are pretty neat. I learned all about them from Applejack. The Hippogriffs all once lived happily on Mount Aris. But when the Storm King invaded, they used a magic pearl to turn into seaponies and escape to the underwater safety of Seaquestria. Then, in the Battle of Canterlot, when Applejack defeated the Storm King<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait, what? She told you she defeated him? By herself?"
Apple Bloom,"Uh, maybe she didn't say that exactly. But it makes for a better story."
Others,"""All Aboard"": Final stop <U+0096> Mount Aris Station!"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Whoa!
Sweetie Belle,All right. So what kind of cutie mark-related friendship problem do you think we're supposed to solve.
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know. But Hippogriffs don't have cutie marks. So it might not have anything to do with that at all.
Apple Bloom,"Huh. Still, the Map called us, so it must be a kind of problem that only we can solve."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Go, Crusaders!"
Sweetie Belle,But how do we know exactly who we're supposed to help?
Scootaloo,"Ahem. Attention, please! Anygriff here have a problem?"
Scootaloo,Eh. That's all I got.
Apple Bloom,"Maybe if the Map could be a little more specific about our mission, like maybe... an address?"
Twilight Sparkle,The Map doesn't really work like that. But I'm sure you and whoever needs help will find each other.
Terramar,Excuse me! Miss Sparkle? Over here! Sorry I'm late. I'm Silverstream's brother Terramar.
Apple Bloom,A Hippogriff can have a seapony for a brother? How does that work exactly?
Sweetie Belle,Shhh! It's rude to ask a question like that!
Scootaloo,Whoa!
Apple Bloom,Can I ask now?
Terramar,"[chuckles] It is kind of strange. See, after the Storm King was defeated, the seaponies didn't have to hide anymore. So some of them changed back to Hippogriffs and went home to Mount Aris."
Twilight Sparkle,But others got used to living under the water and stayed in Seaquestria.
Terramar,"And me? Well, I kind of go back and forth with this. It's a tiny piece of the magic pearl. It was split up among our kingdoms."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'm pretty eager to see the Hippogriff village. You know, to... get this form signed. And... research! So..."
Apple Bloom,"Hey, Terramar? Does anygriff you know up there have a problem they need help with?"
Terramar,[chuckles] On Mount Aris? No. Everygriff is pretty happy up there. [sighs] It's a great place to live.
Twilight Sparkle,"Whoa! This looks amazing! Last time I was here, it was a ghost town!"
Terramar,Yeah. Queen Novo thought it was important to return our village to its former glory.
Sky Beak,"And now, I officially open the ""Glad to Be a Hippogriff"" Festival!"
Twilight Sparkle and Cutie Mark Crusaders,Ahh! Whoa!
Scootaloo,Wow! We picked a good day to show up!
Terramar,Not really. We do this every weekend. Hippogriffs really like being Hippogriffs.
Sky Beak,[chuckles] There's my boy!
Terramar,"Hi, Dad!"
Sky Beak,"Haven't seen you in days, son. Wish you'd come around more often."
Terramar,"Oh! Dad, these are some of Silverstream's friends from Equestria. They came up to<U+0097>"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Aah!
Sky Beak,"Attention, everygriff! Princess Twilight Sparkle is here! She's Silverstream's teacher!"
Sky Beak,"Here to take in the marvel that is Mount Aris, your Highness?"
Twilight Sparkle,Absolutely! And to have you sign a form for Silverstream.
Sky Beak,"Glad to! But first, let's show the princess some real Mount Aris hospitality! To the refreshment tent for a stein of salmon juice!"
Twilight Sparkle,Eh. Research. See you later! And good luck! I know you'll find your mission!
Sweetie Belle,"Well, your dad's certainly... outgoing, isn't he?"
Terramar,He's a great guy. All my relatives are nice. That's kind of the problem<U+0097>
Sweetie Belle,"Wait, stop."
Sweetie Belle,What's that wonderful sound?
Terramar,Those are the Harmonizing Heights. Legend says that<U+0097>
Sweetie Belle,Woo-hoo! Yeah! Awesome! I love this!
Terramar,"Uh, is she okay?"
Sweetie Belle,This is absolutely the best place ever! You are so lucky!
Scootaloo,And you get to swim in the ocean! You have two great places to live!
Apple Bloom,How do you make up your mind which one to stay in?
Terramar,I can't. That's the problem.
Apple Bloom,"Did you say... ""problem""?"
Sweetie Belle,You have a problem?!
Scootaloo,Yes!
Sweetie Belle,Woo-hoo! We discovered our mission!
Scootaloo,All right!
Apple Bloom,We did it!
Scootaloo,Sorry. You were talking about your problem?
Terramar,"Right. Like I said, Mount Aris is one great place to live. That's why Silverstream and my dad and some of my cousins came back here. But Seaquestria is another great place to live. That's where my mom is."
Sweetie Belle,Ohhhh. I-I didn't know that.
Terramar,"So no matter where I am, I feel like I'm letting someone down."
Apple Bloom,No wonder you're having such a hard time deciding.
Terramar,And I have to choose soon. Every other griff my age already knows where they belong. I'm still not sure.
Scootaloo,"When in doubt, chart it out!"
Scootaloo,"Now, we put down everything great about each place and everything not so great. Compare them, and... your decision is made for you!"
Sweetie Belle,"Well, it's obvious, isn't it? Mount Aris is the best of all possible worlds. Pro <U+0096> it's beautiful. Con <U+0096> too far from Equestria. I think that pretty much sums it up."
Terramar,But you haven't been to Seaquestria yet. How can you even compare them?
Apple Bloom,"Terramar's right, Sweetie Belle. It'd be fair if we visited both places before we decide."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, everypony! This festival is fantastic! Look what I won at the ring toss booth! Ahem. But of course, I'm really here on business. Sky Beak's already signed the form. Now I just need your mom's signature. Is she around?"
Apple Bloom,Um... she's a seapony. In Seaquestria.
Twilight Sparkle,"That's what Silverstream meant by ""houses""!"
Terramar,"Mm-hmm. If you'd like to meet my mom, we're just heading down there now."
Apple Bloom,And how exactly are we gonna visit underwater?
Scootaloo,Whoa! [giggling] Woo-hoo! Yeah! [giggling] Whoa! This must be just like flying! Woo-hoo!
Apple Bloom,"Where's your mom's house, Terramar?"
Terramar,Come on. It's this way.
Scootaloo,This is awesome!
Terramar,Mom!
Ocean Flow,"Terramar! Welcome home, baby! No excuses. This time, you're staying for dinner."
Terramar,"[chuckles] Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, this is my mom Ocean Flow. And this is<U+0097>"
Ocean Flow,"[gasps] Princess Twilight Sparkle! What an honor! You know, Silverstream just raves about you."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, she is one of our most hardworking students. In fact, I brought this form for you to sign so that<U+0097>"
Ocean Flow,Both my children are so smart. Would you like to see their baby pictures?
Terramar,Mom!
Twilight Sparkle,"That sounds adorable! I'd love to! And you know, to find out about aquatic pony early development and, uh..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,[giggling] Research.
Ocean Flow,"Oh, well, maybe your friends would like a snack while we're gone? Some kelp chips? Fish oil tea?"
Terramar,"No, thanks, Mom. I'm gonna go show them around."
Scootaloo,Look out! [giggling] Can't catch me!
Sweetie Belle,"Huh. Not much sunlight down here, is there?"
Scootaloo,Boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom!
Scootaloo,[bubbly] Everything sounds funny down here!
Sweetie Belle,"Okay. I've seen everything I need to. So, uh, why don't we find Twilight Sparkle, finish the chart, and, uh, head back up the mountain? I have some serious field twirling to do."
Sky Beak,"[screeches] Princess Twilight, you're back! And just in time for the screeching competition."
Twilight Sparkle,Why not? Could be another trophy in my future! Be back soon!
Scootaloo,All right! Let's add some positives to the Seaquestria side!
Apple Bloom,Uh-huh!
Scootaloo,"Swimming is like flying, multi-color fish, and did I mention the flying thing?!"
Sweetie Belle,"You forgot the cons. Dark, wet, sea monsters..."
Scootaloo,"I don't remember any sea monsters. Apple Bloom, looks like it's up to you."
Apple Bloom,Me? Well... Both places have a lot of good things about them. I can understand why it's hard for you to decide.
Apple Bloom,"Your heart is in two places, you can only live in one You're torn between the hilltops and the tide"
Sweetie Belle,Thank goodness that the Cutie Mark Crusaders have begun To give you hope and help you to decide
Others,"These hills, they call to you, they say ""Harmonizing Heights"" This is your home, simple and serene The sun-dappled leaves or a mountain terrace You can see twenty-three different shades of green"
Others,"To dare to compare anywhere to there Is unfair and just plain wrong Colt or mare or you wear feathers, fins, or hair This is where you belong"
Scootaloo,"Well, on the other hoof, I can think of a place that's way more exciting and cool, not to mention more you! Come on, you know exactly where I mean!"
Others,"Seaquestria's the most, you're supposed to be there Underneath the sea where you can feel at home Swimmin' with your friends, you can spend all day here Playin' in the bay here, splashin' in the foam"
Others,"Sailin' through the wavy blue You'll view a slew of tortoises Forget the rest, the sea's the best For all intents and ""porpoises"""
Sweetie Belle,Build your nest here on Harmonizing Heights
Scootaloo,Live it up here in Seaquestria
Sweetie Belle,Nothing compares to Harmonizing Heights The eagles are regal
Scootaloo,But the schools are cooler
Sweetie Belle,Their claws are so awesome
Scootaloo,With their sweet maneuvers
Sweetie Belle,Star wishes every night
Scootaloo,Starfish by eel light
Sweetie Belle,Better
Scootaloo,Wetter
Sweetie Belle,Shinier
Scootaloo,Brinier Seaquestria!
Sweetie Belle,Harmonizing Heights!
Scootaloo,Seaquestria!
Sweetie Belle,Harmonizing Heights!
Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo,That's it! This is the end! Don't ever talk to me again!
Apple Bloom,"Terramar, where're you goin'?"
Terramar,"Ugh! If you all can't even agree amongst yourselves, how am I supposed to make up my mind?! It's hopeless!"
Scootaloo,Hmph!
Apple Bloom,Sweetie Belle said to tell you it's your fault that Terramar ran off.
Scootaloo,"Well, you tell Sweetie Belle that if it weren't for her, our mission would've been over by now! And a success!"
Apple Bloom,[sighs] Scootaloo says this whole thing is your fault.
Sweetie Belle,"Well, tell her that I'm not the one who dashed all of Terramar's hopes and made him give up on the world! Both worlds!"
Apple Bloom,"[sighs] Sweetie Belle says it's your fault that Terramar ran<U+0097> Oh. Wait. I already told you that, didn't I?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, what's going on? Where's Terramar?"
Apple Bloom,"Uh, well... he... he kinda left. He wanted to be by himself."
Scootaloo,Which was not my fault!
Sweetie Belle,"Mine, either!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, of course not. Why would you think that?"
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle,Because it was our fault.
Scootaloo,All we had to do was help him choose which world to live in.
Sweetie Belle,And we let him down.
Twilight Sparkle,Whoever said that he had to choose?
Apple Bloom,"Well, he did."
Twilight Sparkle,Hmmm... Maybe Terramar's making it harder than it has to be.
Ocean Flow,Yoo-hoo! Princess! We're having a seashell-crafting circle. Care to join us?
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, we're right in the middle of<U+0097>"
Sky Beak,There you are! The flag-folding ceremony's about to begin!
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you, really. I've had a great time in both places today, but... [whispering, to Cutie Mark Crusaders] Wow. This must be how Terramar feels all the time."
Ocean Flow,"Oh! Hello, Sky Beak."
Sky Beak,Ocean Flow! You're looking well.
Sweetie Belle,Hmmm... This gives me an idea.
Scootaloo,Huh. I thought for sure he came this way.
Sweetie Belle,[gasps] He did.
Terramar,"And I'm staying here, too! That way, I don't have to be on land or in the water!"
Scootaloo,"We're sorry. We were supposed to help you, and..."
Sweetie Belle,...we just ended up confusing you more. It's all our fault.
Terramar,"Oh, great! You're sorry, and I'm still confused! I'm staying in my tree."
Apple Bloom,We might have somethin' worth comin' down for.
Sweetie Belle,We thought we'd get every creature together for a picnic on the beach.
Scootaloo,And we mean every creature!
Sky Beak,Son! There you are! Your friends told us how you've been feeling.
Ocean Flow,"And we're sorry if we ever made you think you had to choose between worlds. That wasn't our intention, honey."
Sky Beak,"Your Hippogriff heritage is something to be proud of, certainly."
Ocean Flow,"But you're more than just where you're from or who you live with. We love you because you're you, no matter where you choose to be."
Sky Beak,You don't have to decide. You can keep doing what you've been doing <U+0096> going back and forth.
Ocean Flow,And enjoying both places.
Scootaloo,Something we forgot to add that both places have <U+0096> family and friends who love you.
Terramar,"Thanks for everything. Hey, uh, are you glowing?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Yes! We did it!
Twilight Sparkle,Congratulations! Your first map mission is a success!
Sweetie Belle,Guess that means we're officially done here. I hope you come visit your sister in Equestria.
Apple Bloom,"Yeah, come see us! You'll love it!"
Scootaloo,Who knows? You might even want to live there!
Scootaloo,"Yeah, that was a joke."
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia, I have an idea for your ones-versary."
Princess Celestia,"My... ""ones-versary""?"
Twilight Sparkle,"The one-thousand, one-hundred, eleventh year anniversary of when you first raised the sun."
Spike,"Good thing Pinkie Pie reminded us, or we would have forgot to celebrate."
Princess Celestia,You're not the only ones. What did you have in mind?
Twilight Sparkle,"To commemorate your first sunrise, I've written a play. We'd like to perform it at my School of Friendship, if you don't mind."
Princess Celestia,[giggling happily] Mind? Oh! Of course not! Oh! I think a play is a fantastic idea!
Spike,Did she just... prance?
Princess Celestia,"Oh, uh, forgive me for getting so excited. It's just, when I was a filly, my friends often put on plays. [sighs] It was so wonderful. Everypony coming together to create a magical experience to share with others. I've always believed theater brings out the best in us and forges a special bond of friendship."
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] I didn't know you used to act!
Princess Celestia,"Oh, not me. I was always too busy with my magic lessons to be part of any plays myself. But still, it's something I always wished I could experience."
Twilight Sparkle,"And you still can! Princess Celestia, we would be honored if you would be the star of our play!"
Spike,We would?!
Princess Celestia,You want me to star in your play?!
Spike,"Yeah... When did that happen, exactly?"
Twilight Sparkle,"If you'll excuse us for a second... [whispering] Don't you see, Spike? It's perfect! Princess Celestia has always wanted to be in a play, and this one's about her!"
Spike,"[whispering] I guess, but how are we supposed to give her directions? She's the ruler of Equestria!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[whispering] She's also our friend. Celestia's always kind to everypony. So if we have a chance to finally do something for her, we should."
Spike,Hmmm...
Twilight Sparkle,"[whispering] Come on. How many times has Celestia helped us? Guided us? Been a warm, calming voice over our shoulder?"
Princess Celestia,Twilight.
Twilight Sparkle and Spike,Aah!
Twilight Sparkle,"<U+00A0>Yes, Princess Celestia?"
Princess Celestia,"Your invitation is very kind, but are you certain it's wise? I have no acting experience at all."
Twilight Sparkle,Experience? Pssh! You'll be playing yourself. And we'll all help you. Please? It'd mean so much to the students if you were in our show.
Princess Celestia,"Well, if you're sure..."
Spike,"Yeah, what she said."
Princess Celestia,Then I would be delighted to join your theater troupe!
Pinkie Pie,Woo-hoo! Confetti is ready! Woo-hoo!
Applejack,"Puh! Wormy apple cores, Pinkie! How many times have I told you to keep your special effects away from my sets?!"
Applejack,Ugh.
Starlight Glimmer,"I can't believe you've memorized your lines already, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,"Once you get past terrifying, paralyzing stage fright, the rest is easy. Now I just hope Princess Celestia says we can do our play."
Rarity,"Oh, as soon as she sees these fabulous costumes, all she'll be able to say is ""Brava!"""
Rainbow Dash,Heads up! Here comes our answer!
Twilight Sparkle,"[panting] Wonderful news, everypony!"
Applejack,Yeehaw! We get to put on our show?
Twilight Sparkle,Even better. Princess Celestia is gonna be our star!
Spike,"Yeah, that's how I felt, too."
Rainbow Dash,Celestia? Starring in our play? This is huge!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, she was a little nervous at first, but I told her not to worry. With us helping, it will all go smooth as<U+0097>"
Rarity,"Silk! I must find the silk! If Celestia's going to be in our play, we have to take everything up to the next level! None of these old ideas will do!"
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah! Forget my regular party cannon! For princess-sized effects, we're gonna need Big Bertha!"
Applejack,Grrrr...! Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie,What?
Rainbow Dash,Our play is gonna be amazing! I gotta tell everypony I know! And even the ones I don't!
Applejack,Why in tarnation are y'all gettin' so starstruck? We've met Princess Celestia before. Plenty of times.
Starlight Glimmer,"Those were formal things <U+0096> galas, world-saving. This is different! Imagine doing sweaty warm-ups with a princess, blowing your nose in front of a princess, sitting around just... talking with a princess."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm a princess. You talk to me.
Starlight Glimmer,"That's different. You're not a ""princess"" princess."
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, thanks. Celestia wants to experience the special friendship that theater ponies have. To give her that, you just need to be yourselves."
Fluttershy,You... You really think so?
Applejack,"Heh. Aw, quit frettin'. It's only a couple o' pals gettin' together to put on a ones-versary play. What could go wrong?"
Spike,"[amplified] Places, everypony! We're here to rehearse ""A New Day in Equestria""!"
Spike,"[amplified] Directed, written, and produced by Twilight Sparkle."
Twilight Sparkle,"Page one, act one, scene one. Action!"
Fluttershy,"Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard, it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it."
Fluttershy,"And every day, the unicorns helping Star Swirl would use so much magic, they lost their powers forever. Things looked bleak. Soon, Equestria would lose all its magic users! Then, the land would be covered in darkness for eternity!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[to Spike] Even I can't believe how good my play is! The sets, the props, the outfits <U+0096> they're all great!"
Spike,And... here comes the best part.
Fluttershy,"But then, a student named Celestia discovered she had the power to raise the sun herself without draining her magic!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, that's your cue, Celestia."
Princess Celestia,"Oh! Uh, right! Of course! Heh. [clears throat] [quietly] It is time for a new day in Equestria."
Spike,"Um, what?"
Princess Celestia,"Oh, uh, I said [quietly] it is time for a new day in Equestria."
Twilight Sparkle,And your delivery was... great! But maybe you should try it a tiny bit louder for the ponies in the back row.
Princess Celestia,"Oh, yes, yes. My Royal Canterlot Voice. Thank you for the reminder, Twilight. [booming] It is time for a new day in Equestria!"
Princess Celestia,Oh! Goodness! This theater does have strong acoustics. M-My apologies. I'm still learning to hone my craft.
Twilight Sparkle,"No, no! You're doing... fine! Why don't we try it one more time? Just like you're talking to me."
Princess Celestia,[flat and stilted] It is time for a new day in Equestria-aaa.
Twilight Sparkle,A bit more energy.
Princess Celestia,"[rushed and hyperactive] It's time for a new day in Equestria! [normal] Uh, how was that?"
Applejack,"Uh, honestly?"
Twilight Sparkle,Great! Wow! It's hard to believe you've never done this before! Let's move onto the dance number!
Spike,"Again! Step, buck, leap, touch! Again! Step, buck, leap, touch! Got it? Movin' on! Five, six, seven, eight!"
Princess Celestia,"[with wildly varying tone] Come on, Star Swirl. Throw off that must-Y hat and let's have a... a dance!"
Princess Celestia,"Oh, dear. I think we have a problem!"
Applejack,[whispering] Yeah. Our lead actress is a disaster!
Twilight Sparkle,"[hyperventilating] What are we gonna do?! If I tell Celestia she's terrible, it'll hurt her feelings, and I'll be a bad friend. But if I keep her in the show, she'll be the laughingstock of Equestria, and I'll be a worse friend."
Applejack,"Ya need to tell Celestia the truth, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,Any other suggestions?
Spike,Why don't we just cancel the show?
Twilight Sparkle,Real suggestions?
Spike,"No, think about it. Right now, most of Equestria doesn't even know we're doing a ones-versary play. If we shut it down..."
Rarity,...Nopony will ever miss it!
Starlight Glimmer,So they'll never find out Princess Celestia's a bad actress!
Fluttershy,And she won't be embarrassed!
Pinkie Pie,Ah! It's the perfect plan!
Rainbow Dash,All right! I just finished telling everypony to come to our play!
Twilight Sparkle,You... did?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! You should've seen how excited they got when they found out Celestia was in it! They said they'd tell their friends, and then their friends would tell their friends! Everypony in Equestria's gonna see this thing! Uh... did I miss something?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Just the bright light of hope being snuffed. But that's okay. If we can't cancel the show, I know what I have to do."
Applejack,Be honest with Celestia and give the lead role to somepony else?
Twilight Sparkle,Not a chance!
Applejack,"Twilight, you know truth is a huge part of friendship."
Twilight Sparkle,"And so is making another pony's dreams come true. Look, I promised Celestia that this time, she could be a part of the play instead of just watching it. And I plan to keep that promise."
Fluttershy,But how?
Princess Celestia,You want to give me acting lessons?
Twilight Sparkle,No-no-no-no-no-no-no. More like a special workshop with other actors. To... take your performance from good to flawless.
Princess Celestia,"Thank you so much, Twilight! This is what I always knew theater must be about <U+0096> that special stage pony bond of shared trust and honesty."
Spike,Yeah. Heh. That's what it is. Ahem.
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia, meet Method Mare performers On Stage and Raspberry Beret!"
On Stage,"Avec pleasure, your Majesty!"
Princess Celestia,"The pleasure is all mine! If there's anything I can do to become a better Equestrian thespian, I will! What do you have planned?"
On Stage,I thought we'd make it up as we go along. [chuckles] Otherwise known as improvisation!
Raspberry Beret,"Yes, and we can start as soon as we get out of this box."
Princess Celestia,What box?
Twilight Sparkle,How's it going over here?
Rainbow Dash,That sun will never rise again.
Pinkie Pie,That's why I have something even better!
Rarity,[gasps] It's the perfect substitute!
Rarity,It was the perfect substitute.
Twilight Sparkle,Please give me something to be happy about.
On Stage,Let's try visualization! And... you're skiing!
Raspberry Beret,"Whoosh! Whoosh! Oh, it's so snowy today! Brrr! I'm getting chilly!"
Princess Celestia,Should I get you a blanket?
On Stage,All aboard! The Ponyville Express is leaving the station! Whoo-whoo! Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga...
Princess Celestia,It is? But I don't see anything.
Raspberry Beret,Let's be weeping willows in the wind! We are strong in adversity yet supple as we bow to fate.
On Stage,Well? What do you feel?
Princess Celestia,Mmmm... nothing. Oh! The classroom floor under my hooves! Does that count?
Twilight Sparkle,Do I wanna know?
Pinkie Pie,Wait for it...
Applejack,Pinkie Pie!
Pinkie Pie,Whaaaat? It's realistic! The sun is just like a burning marshmallow!
Twilight Sparkle,What are they doing now?
Spike,[sighs] The simplest acting exercise they could think of <U+0096> a game of charades.
Raspberry Beret,"A puppy! A duck-billed platypus! Antidisestablishmentarianism! Oh, I give up! What?!"
Princess Celestia,"My love for Equestria and all the ponies in it! Twilight, you felt what I was emoting, didn't you?"
Twilight Sparkle,[stuttering] Yeah!
Spike,"[to On Stage] Now, that's the best acting we've seen all day."
Twilight Sparkle,Okay! I tried and tried and tried! But we have to face facts. We can't make Celestia an actress. So there's only one thing to do!
Applejack,Tell her the truth finally?
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Twilight Sparkle,I've rewritten the script to give Celestia a more artistic part with no lines.
Pinkie Pie,"And to make sure the show's a hit, I've whipped up the biggest, bestest, flashiest fake sun ever!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, Pinkie? That looks unsafe."
Pinkie Pie,Why would untested magic fireworks that I bought in a back alley from Trixie at midnight be unsafe?
Princess Celestia,"Twilight, if you honestly thought I was a bad actress, why didn't you tell me?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to insult your acting! It's just, I-I got so stressed! But... that's no excuse for what I said. You have every right to be upset with me."
Princess Celestia,I'm not upset because you insulted my acting.
Twilight Sparkle,You're not?
Princess Celestia,"I'm upset because, in all the time we've known each other, I thought I taught you about the importance of friendship, trust, and honesty!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Celestia, wait!"
Pinkie Pie,No!
Pinkie Pie,You can't fly away now! Look!
Fluttershy,Ponies are taking their seats for the show.
Rainbow Dash,[laughs] Standing room only! Did I do a good job of advertising for this thing or what? Sorry.
Starlight Glimmer,We can't put on a show with no lead actress!
Applejack,You go find Celestia. We'll figure out a way to stall this thing 'til you get back.
Spike,Good luck. Nopony's gonna volunteer to try to tame that.
Rarity,No pony indeed.
Spike,"So... [chuckles nervously] Ahem. Uh, who likes juggling?"
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Celestia! Please wait! Can we talk?
Princess Celestia,"I'm afraid I haven't much to say, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,"All right then. Just listen. You've guided me since I was a filly. You've given me knowledge and advice and friendship. Just once, I wanted to be able to give something back to you. I know what I did was wrong. I should've told you the truth. But I promised you could be in our play. I had to make it work. Nothing would make me feel worse than knowing I disappointed you."
Princess Celestia,You really mean that?
Twilight Sparkle,Of course! I look up to you more than any pony I've ever met! I hate to let you down. Like I did.
Princess Celestia,"[sighs] You had good intentions, Twilight. But you know that the truth is always better than a well-meant lie. Didn't Applejack remind you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] About a hundred times. And now, because I didn't listen to her, I've ruined your whole ones-versary."
Princess Celestia,"Well... I don't know about that. Isn't there an old saying? ""The show must go on""? There may be a way for us to save the play yet."
Twilight Sparkle,"But how? I mean, if I'm being completely honest... you're not an actress."
Princess Celestia,No. But I am a princess.
Spike,Ugh! Good news <U+0096> free food. [chewing] Bad news <U+0096> this play is officially a disaster.
Princess Celestia,"Fortunately, I know a thing or two about how to deal with those."
Starlight Glimmer,You came back!
Princess Celestia,"Yes. But let's celebrate later. Right now, we have a show to do!"
Rarity,But... but... but how?! The audience is about to riot! We have no backdrop! And our lead actress is<U+0097>!
Rarity,Uhhhh...
Princess Celestia,"No longer in that role. Rarity, Applejack, Pinkie, Twilight, go calm the audience. Let them know the play will start in just a minute."
Princess Celestia,"Rainbow Dash, bring us some clouds and place them behind the stage. There, that's our new backdrop. Starlight, do you have a copy of the script?"
Princess Celestia,"Spike, you narrate the play. Fluttershy will be our new lead."
Princess Celestia,Visualize with me. You're a princess. Regal. Commanding. Confident. Feel the rising sun's warmth. Equestria needs you.
Spike,"Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard that it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it."
Others,"""Rainbow Stars"": You call those great sorcerers?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, no! Hecklers! What should we do?"
Princess Celestia,[whispering] Spike! Improvise!
Spike,"Y-Yes. And, uh... raising the sun each day was super draining. But you can see that for yourselves, right? I mean, do these guys look beat-up or what? Star Swirl's so stressed, he's got kinks in his horn!"
Spike,But that's okay. 'Cause it turns out Celestia had a special power to raise the sun all by herself!
Fluttershy,It's time for a new day in Equestria!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ah! In all the commotion, we forgot we don't have a sun! What do we do?!"
Princess Celestia,We play charades.
On Stage,My goodness! I had no idea this production would have such elaborate special effects!
Princess Celestia,"Judging by how many flowers the audience threw, it seems our play was a success."
Fluttershy,I just feel bad you never got a chance to actually be in it.
Princess Celestia,"You shouldn't. I never felt I had to be on stage to be a part of the show. All I ever wanted was to share an honest bond of creativity, artistry, and happiness with my friends. And that's exactly what I got to do."
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you for saving our play, Princess Celestia."
Princess Celestia,"You're welcome, Twilight. But from now on, none of you will have to call me ""Princess"" anymore."
Twilight Sparkle and Spike,Huh?
Spike,"Wait, what? We don't?"
Princess Celestia,"No. I had so much fun tonight, I've decided to give up my crown, step down from the throne, and devote all of my time to the theater!"
Twilight Sparkle,Y-You... what?!
Princess Celestia,Gotcha! Maybe I'm not such a bad actress after all.
Mail Pony,"[clears throat] Morning, Sunburst."
Sunburst,"What? Oh! Hi! [chuckles nervously] You know, no matter how many times I read it, Houyhnhnm's Guide to Magical Arcana never gets boring."
Mail Pony,If you say so. I've got another letter for you. From Sire's Hollow.
Sunburst,Mm-hmm. Sure thing.
Sunburst,What's this? Could I be experiencing the cerebration transmogrification effect described in chapter seventeen<U+0097>?
Sunburst,Oh. My cutie mark is glowing. My cutie mark is glowing! I know what this means! Why am I yelling?!
Sunburst,"Princess Twilight, what an honor this is! I-I mean, it is, right? I'm called for a friendship mission?"
Twilight Sparkle,You sure are. And it must be a special one. Nopony outside of Ponyville has ever been called before.
Spike,"If you need some pointers, let me know. I've been on my fair share of missions."
Twilight Sparkle,"You've been on one, Spike."
Spike,And that's my fair share.
Sunburst,Starlight! You mean we've both been called? This is great!
Starlight Glimmer,[depressed] Yeah... Great...
Sunburst,Aren't you excited? You and me on a mission together!
Sunburst,I'm... sorry. Are you not excited to go on a mission with me?
Starlight Glimmer,"No. Uh, no! I mean, yes. Heh. Totally excited about us going together. Just... not so excited about where."
Sunburst,Sire's Hollow?
Starlight Glimmer,Yep. Home.
Sunburst,[deflated] Oh. Great.
Spike,"You know, I can go if you two don't want to. I am kind of an expert."
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] It's not that I don't want to go home. It's just that whenever I do, my dad treats me like a filly. Like nothing's changed since I was a foal."
Sunburst,Huh.
Starlight Glimmer,I know. I'm a horrible daughter.
Sunburst,"N-No, no! My mom actually does kind of the same thing."
Starlight Glimmer,Really?
Sunburst,"I don't even have to go home. She sends me letters constantly asking about my plans for the future. [imitating Stellar Flare] ""You're a grown-up pony, Sunburst! You need a plan!"" [sighs] I haven't been home in a while either."
Starlight Glimmer,Hmph. We'll just have to explain to our parents that we're on an important friendship mission so they can't bother us.
Sunburst,Do you really think that will work?
Starlight Glimmer,Nope!
Sunburst,"[sniffs, sighs] The great thing about home is it always stays just how you le<U+0097>"
Sunburst,Augh!
Starlight Glimmer,Where did that come from?
Automated voice,Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
Others,"""Ever Essence"": Essence?"
Sunburst,Essence of what?
Others,"""Ever Essence"": You tell me."
Starlight Glimmer,What is it?
Sunburst,Uh... chocolate maybe?
Others,"""Ever Essence"": Not chocolate maybe. Chocolate definitely! And all of the benefits with none of the drawbacks."
Sunburst,Didn't this used to be a fruit stand?
Others,"""Ever Essence"": I don't know what it used to be. The Sire's Hollow Development Committee determined what it is."
Sunburst,The Sire's Hollow Development what? Where do ponies buy fruit?
Others,"""Ever Essence"": You can get a fruit smoothie two doors down."
Sunburst,All the shops are different. Everything's changed!
Starlight Glimmer,Not everything. That's the same as it ever was.
Others,"""Raspberry Latte"": Sorry. Our bookstore's been declared a site of historical significance by the Sire's Hollow Preservation Society."
Others,"""Minty Mocha"": You'll have to experience the books from here. That's why windows are see-through."
Sunburst,What?!
Starlight Glimmer,Preservation Society? What is happening around here?
Firelight,"I'll explain it to you, sugarplum! [chuckles] You are just as cutesy-wutesy as ever!"
Starlight Glimmer,[muffled] Dad! [normally] Quit it! What is going on?
Starlight Glimmer,"Dad, you promised no ""pumpky-wumpkin""'s in public!"
Firelight,"[whispering] Sorry, chipmunk cheeks."
Starlight Glimmer,Don't. You're preserving the whole town? That's crazy!
Stellar Flare,"That's exactly what I told him! I said, ""Firelight, you're crazy!"""
Sunburst,Mom?
Stellar Flare,"Our village needs the same thing you do, Sunburst <U+0096> a clear plan for the future."
Stellar Flare,That's why I started the Sire's Hollow Development Committee. And I've got plans for this little town. Big plans!
Firelight,"Listen here, Stellar Flare! I'm not gonna let you turn our historical heritage into Las Pegasus!"
Stellar Flare,And I'm not gonna let you turn it into a museum!
Starlight Glimmer,W-Wait. Are you two fighting over this?
Sunburst,Like having a friendship problem?
Stellar Flare,"Oh, there's no problem."
Firelight,Because there is no friendship!
Sunburst,"Well, the good news is we know why we're here."
Sunburst,[sighs] Maybe we should've sent Spike after all.
Starlight Glimmer,"Sunburst and I were called here to do a job, and it looks like you two are it."
Stellar Flare,You mean your success depends on us?
Sunburst,Uh...
Firelight,And you have to hang out with us the whole time you're here?!
Starlight Glimmer,Um...
Stellar Flare,"Well, I'll hear what you have to say. But every plan I've made for this town is perfectly reasonable."
Firelight,Good luck convincing me my preservation efforts don't make sense.
Automated voice,Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
Starlight Glimmer,So we can't hold the books?
Others,"""Raspberry Latte"": [laughing] No!"
Sunburst,Can you hold the books?
Others,"""Minty Mocha"": No."
Starlight Glimmer,So nopony can read the books?
Automated voice,Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
Others,"""Ever Essence"": You can call them... mm... ""smells"". But I call them essence!"
Starlight Glimmer,[sniffs] Fruity.
Sunburst,Too bad there's nowhere to get actual fruit.
Stellar Flare,"In the future, all ponies will drink their fruit!"
Others,"""Cracked Wheat"": One hundred percent ancient pony grains! Just like the town founders ate! Hope you like crust!"
Automated voice,Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
Automated voice,Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
Automated voice,Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
Automated voice,Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
Automated voice,Welcome to Sire's<U+0097>!
Stellar Flare,"Okay, it's annoying. I get it."
Firelight,Maybe my preservation efforts were a little over the top.
Others,"""Cracked Wheat"": [groans] Oh, no."
Stellar Flare,And I might have been trying to turn the town into a shopping mall.
Firelight,"Well, whatever direction the town takes from now on, how about we work together on it?"
Stellar Flare,"Deal! Sunburst, you should move closer to Ponyville. After this success, I'm sure the Princess of Friendship will want to send you on more missions."
Sunburst,"That's not really how it works. Oh, look at the time! We should get going now that we solved the friendship problem, right, Starlight?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah... The thing is, I don't think we did solve it. When we solve a friendship problem, our cutie marks are supposed to glow."
Firelight,"Aw, don't be disappointed, puddin'. Your papa will work this out for ya."
Starlight Glimmer,Heh. My papa wasn't called by the map in Twilight's castle. I was.
Stellar Flare,How are you gonna explain this to the princess? What's your plan if she fires you from friendship quests?
Sunburst,Mom! She doesn't<U+0097>! It-It's not<U+0097>!
Stellar Flare,"Use your words, Sunburst."
Starlight Glimmer,I guess you two weren't the problem we were sent to solve after all.
Stellar Flare,So now you don't even know why you're here? Ah! We have to figure this out before we run out of time!
Sunburst,"[sighs] Mom, there isn't a time limit."
Firelight,"So you're here for an extra long visit? [laughs] You can stay in your old room, punkie wunk! It's just like you left it!"
Starlight Glimmer,[whispering] We need to find this friendship problem now!
Firelight,"Now, I know you have your little job to do, but Stellar and I know the town a lot better than you two."
Stellar Flare,That's right! Neither of you have been home in ages. You're gonna need our help to succeed!
Starlight Glimmer,I guess that makes sense...
Stellar Flare,I already have some ideas!
Firelight,"Me, too!"
Sunburst,I think I liked it better when they were fighting.
Firelight,"Okay! Now that I've explained how Sire's Hollow was founded, we can start to explore all the possible friendship problems that might have developed over time."
Starlight Glimmer,"[inhales] I appreciate the history lesson, Dad, but I need to find the problem now. In the present."
Firelight,"Aw, now, hon-bun. How are you gonna do that without all the backstory, huh? Oh! Of course I know how hard it is for you to sit still and focus, soooo... would it help you pay attention to hold on to your bwankie?"
Stellar Flare,"Now, you've had a little setback. But don't worry. I know exactly what you need to do."
Sunburst,Make a plan?
Stellar Flare,Already got one! Step one <U+0096> interview the suspects. Step two <U+0096> use your talents to solve the issue. Step three <U+0096> get the Princess of Friendship to send you on more missions!
Sunburst,Mom! It does not work like that!
Stellar Flare,Uh-huh.
Others,"""Ever Essence"": [poorly acted] Oh! Thank goodness you are here! These two ponies refuse to use my essences."
Others,"""Raspberry Latte"": Maybe because we don't like to cover our natural scent!"
Others,"""Ever Essence"": Ugh."
Others,"""Raspberry Latte"": Ugh."
Others,"""Minty Mocha"": [sighs] [poorly acted] And she refuses to buy our books."
Others,"""Ever Essence"", ""Raspberry Latte"", and ""Minty Mocha"": [poorly acted] Surely this is a friendship problem."
Stellar Flare,This is what happens when we don't rehearse! Ugh!
Firelight,"Starlight? Sweetie? I found a really old town bylaw that nopony agrees on. Apparently, we're not supposed to prance or canter after dinnertime. Could that be the problem? Silly-filly?"
Starlight Glimmer,Whew! What are you doing?
Sunburst,[sighs] Hiding from my mother. She started making up friendship problems for me to solve.
Starlight Glimmer,"[scoffs] My dad won't even let me talk to anypony in case they're ""strangers"". I'm a grown mare!"
Sunburst,"[sighs] We're never going to find the friendship problem with them around, let alone solve it."
Starlight Glimmer,"[whispering] Okay! So we wanted to talk to all of you, you know, in private."
Sunburst,[whispering] Just to see if there were issues any of you had with your friends.
Others,"""Ever Essence"": [whispering] Got it. Just one question. Why are we whispering?"
Others,"""Cracked Wheat"": They're avoiding their parents."
Sunburst,No. Not avoiding. Just... taking a break.
Starlight Glimmer,Yeah. We needed to focus. B-But we're definitely not avoiding them.
Others,"""Raspberry Latte"": So you're whispering with all of us in the darkest corner of the shop where nopony can possibly see because you're not avoiding them?"
Starlight Glimmer,Mm-hmm.
Sunburst,"Uh, but they definitely can't hear us in here, right?"
Others,"""Cracked Wheat"": No way! This is the antiquities section. Nopony ever comes back here."
Firelight,There you are! But what are you doing in here? [gasps] Is the friendship problem in my favorite section of the bookstore?
Firelight,"...And then, I thought the best way to look for a friendship problem in the present..."
Starlight Glimmer,Dad!
Firelight,...was to look back in our town history even farther!
Stellar Flare,"Sunburst! Oh, finally! Now, I know you don't want me to make up a problem, but what if I start one?"
Sunburst,That's not how this<U+0097>!
Stellar Flare,"I mean, nopony ever became a success by following all the rules, right?"
Stellar Flare,[to Firelight] How are things on your end?
Firelight,Couldn't be better! New leads and such!
Starlight Glimmer,Guys...?
Stellar Flare,"We really are providing excellent assistance, aren't we?"
Sunburst,Guys!
Firelight,I dare say our children should be grateful for our help.
Starlight Glimmer,Guys!
Starlight Glimmer and Sunburst,We don't want your help!
Stellar Flare,I'm sorry. You don't want our help?
Firelight,[chuckles] That's... That's ridiculous! What reason could you possibly have for that?
Starlight Glimmer,Because you're driving us crazy!
Stellar Flare,"Oh, really? And just how am I driving you crazy?"
Sunburst,"By always coming up with plans! I don't need a plan! I mean, maybe I do, but it'll be mine, not yours!"
Starlight Glimmer,"And you're not any better! I'm not a filly! I'm a grown pony with a job to do, and I'll do it on my own!"
Firelight,Well. I'll let you get to it then.
Starlight Glimmer,Great. Now we have to smooth things over with our parents on top of finding and solving a friendship problem.
Sunburst,It's almost like our relationship with our parents is the friendship problem.
Starlight Glimmer,"You don't think that's it, do you?"
Others,"""Cracked Wheat"": [clears throat] That's what all of us think."
Starlight Glimmer,"[groans, collapses] Why couldn't we have been sent to stop a war or something?!"
Starlight Glimmer,Dad?
Firelight,"Hello, Ms. Glimmer. How is your friendship problem search going? I only ask as an interested observer, since I know you are an adult who's capable of doing things without help from anypony else."
Starlight Glimmer,Actually... I think Sunburst and I figured out what it is.
Firelight,So Stellar and I weren't really helpful after all.
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, we haven't actually solved it. And I don't think we can. Not without you."
Stellar Flare,[coughing] Pungent. Ugh. [to Sunburst] Oh. Did you come by to be driven crazy by more of your mother's plans?
Sunburst,"No, I came to apologize."
Stellar Flare,"Well, it's going to take more than an apology to make up for telling me you don't want my help finding your friendship problem."
Sunburst,"Oh, I'm not sorry for that. Starlight and I already figured out what the problem is."
Stellar Flare,This is a terrible apology.
Sunburst,"Well, if you come with me and help fix it, I'll give you a better one."
Starlight Glimmer,"Usually, Twilight or one of our other friends gets called to a place with a friendship problem to fix."
Sunburst,But Starlight and I realized we came here to fix a friendship problem we already had.
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm sorry I've been avoiding coming home, Dad. But you can't keep treating me like a foal."
Firelight,"I'm sorry, sugarbun. [sighs] I just know how hard things were for you when you left home. I guess I wanted you to feel safe, like... when you were young."
Starlight Glimmer,"Dad, I know I've made some mistakes, and I'll probably make a bunch more. But I learn from them. I think that's what growing up is."
Sunburst,"I'm sorry I never told you how much your plans bothered me, and I know you just want me to succeed. But I need to do that on my own."
Stellar Flare,"I remember how lost you were when you flunked out of magic school. I thought as long as you had a plan, you'd never feel that way again."
Sunburst,"You don't have to worry, Mom. I need to find my own way. And I definitely don't feel lost anymore."
Others,"""Cracked Wheat"": [crying] That's so beautiful!"
Stellar Flare,The glowing cutie mark is such a symbol of accomplishment. I don't suppose there's a way for you to get it to glow all the time.
Sunburst,[chuckles] Pretty sure it doesn't work that way.
Starlight Glimmer,"Not unless we solved a friendship problem every few seconds, and I kinda hope this one will be it for a while."
Firelight,"You know, it seems to me your map is saying we're not just your parents. Heh. We're your friends, too."
Starlight Glimmer,I guess so.
Firelight,"So if I promise to treat you less like a little filly and more like a friend, will you visit more?"
Starlight Glimmer,Absolutely. Mmm.
Sunburst,"And if you start to drive me crazy again, I'll tell you instead of never coming home."
Stellar Flare,"That's lovely of you to say, dear. But you know, I can always visit you."
Firelight,"Stellar, you're a genius! [laughs] How do you feel about a road trip?"
Stellar Flare,I might have a few plans for that.
Yona,Huh?
Silverstream,Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?
Applejack,You're just in time. But it's gonna be me.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, right. I got this one nailed."
Twilight Sparkle,And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is... Fluttershy!
Applejack,[groans] Again?
Rainbow Dash,Come on!
Fluttershy,"Oh, my! I don't know how I keep winning."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah. Me, neither."
Twilight Sparkle,The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you.
Twilight Sparkle,"Congratulations, Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle,Next item of business <U+0096> I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike?
Twilight Sparkle,"Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning. Add that together, and what do you get?"
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, ooh! Okay, let me see. One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask<U+0097>"
Applejack,"I'm your pony, Twilight! Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork."
Applejack,[chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me.
Rainbow Dash,"[chuckles] I wouldn't say ""better"". Just a little more qualified. No offense."
Fluttershy,Maybe you can lead the field trip together.
Twilight Sparkle,Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team?
Pinkie Pie,"Um, Rarity? Fluttershy? Me? Spike? This flowerpot?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Both of you are teamwork experts. If the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd never let that get in the way of friendship education."
Applejack,Of course!
Rainbow Dash,Totally!
Ocellus,I've never been on a field trip before.
Smolder,"Yeah, what's the point of this exactly?"
Gallus,Getting out of the classroom. Duh.
Sandbar,[chuckles] Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind.
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship."
Applejack,"Hey, y'all! Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?"
Rainbow Dash,"This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever! With me in charge, that is. Whoa!"
Applejack,[chuckles nervously] With us in charge. Meanin' mostly me.
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. Good one.
Twilight Sparkle,And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?
Silverstream,No... way. We get to do both?!
Twilight Sparkle,I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind. Why don't you start with shed building first?
Applejack,"Heh. Don't mind if I do! Everycreature, follow the leader!"
Twilight Sparkle,I'll check in later to see how it's going. Remember to work together!
Applejack,"[deep inhale] Now take a good, deep breath. What do you smell?"
Gallus,"[inhale] Uh, yak?"
Yona,[sniffing] Mm-hmm!
Applejack,Nope. Try again.
Ocellus,"Um, apples?"
Applejack,And...? Anyone? Anyone? No? The promise of... teamwork! That there's an apple shed. And this here is what we're gonna use to build it. Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard work and honest sweat.
Rainbow Dash,[laughing] Sweat? Seriously? That's supposed to be part of friendship?
Applejack,"Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash. Just ""Teacher of the Month"" kind o' ponies."
Rainbow Dash,Whatever. Let's just get this done so we can move on to my activity.
Applejack,That's it! Measure twice and cut once! Haste makes waste! Slow and steady!
Rainbow Dash,Emphasis on the slow.
Applejack,Rainbow Dash! Ya can't build an apple shed like that!
Rainbow Dash,"[scoffs] Oh, yeah? I just did!"
Sandbar,Whoa! No way!
Rest of Young Six,Whoa!
Gallus,Impressive... if you can call an apple shed impressive.
Applejack,Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good!
Applejack,"Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, come on! These students are totally gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done!"
Applejack,No! They're gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done right!
Smolder,Yeah... This isn't awkward at all...
Applejack,Steady... Steady... Take 'er nice and slow...
Applejack,Little to the left...
Applejack,"Uh, a hair to the right..."
Applejack,"Now, a hoof shavin' higher..."
Rainbow Dash,[growls] Just bring it down already!
Applejack,I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin'.
Yona,[chuckles nervously] Uh...
Ocellus,"Um, professors? I'm a little confused about teamwork now."
Rainbow Dash,That's because you need a different teacher. Follow me! Last one to the stream is a rotten apple shed!
Rainbow Dash,Who's ready to smash the all-time Equestria speed record for river canoeing?!
Gallus,Is that even a thing?
Sandbar,First I've heard of it.
Rainbow Dash,We need to get to the finish line before this alarm goes off. That means you gotta move fast! Any questions?
Yona,"Uh, Yona has questions."
Rainbow Dash,No time for 'em! Get in the boat!
Applejack,You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?
Rainbow Dash,I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood.
Yona,Yak not like water.
Ocellus,"Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle."
Gallus,"We got you, Yona."
Applejack,"Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer."
Rainbow Dash,We'll see about that.
Rainbow Dash,"Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder! Put your backs into it, newbies!"
Applejack,"Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Slower... Focus on your paddle technique, y'all."
Silverstream,Woo-hoo! We're really going now!
Smolder,So... when do we get to the part when we move?
Rainbow Dash,"When everycreature starts listening to me, the leader of my activity, Applejack! Now stroke!"
Rainbow Dash,"Dig in, team! We can still beat that record!"
Applejack,Stop!
Rainbow Dash,Go!
Ocellus,Which way do we go?
Rainbow Dash,Left!
Applejack,Right!
Silverstream,"Aye-aye, captains! Wait, what?"
Rainbow Dash,Left! I can see the finish line from here!
Applejack,"If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish!"
Rainbow Dash,Who cares about a few fish?
Sandbar,"Uh, professors?"
Applejack,You'll care plenty when they bite ya!
Sandbar,Guys?
Rainbow Dash,We'll just go around them!
Sandbar,Rock!
Silverstream,I love field trips!
Applejack,I hope you're happy.
Rainbow Dash,[scoffs] Obviously not! Because there goes our new speed record!
Yona,"[panicked whistling, coughing] Help! Yak not swim!"
Ocellus,That's okay! Your friends can change into creatures that do!
Twilight Sparkle,How's the canoeing... going?
Smolder,About as good as the apple shed building.
Rainbow Dash,I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!
Applejack,I did not!
Rainbow Dash,Did too!
Applejack,Did not!
Gallus,Yup. It's been like this all day.
Sandbar,I wouldn't say all day. Just... ninety-nine percent of it.
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that!
Rainbow Dash,We are! Mostly.
Applejack,We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all.
Twilight Sparkle,The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field trip!
Applejack,"H-Hold up, Twilight. Don't count Rainbow Dash for the award just yet. You shoulda seen her fire up those students to build a shed."
Rainbow Dash,"No way! You're the one the students listen to. Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, long story. But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all."
Rainbow Dash,Field trip?
Twilight Sparkle,Well...
Rainbow Dash,"Come on, Twilight. We get it. No more arguing. Right, Applejack?"
Applejack,Right as rain and twice as fresh!
Twilight Sparkle,Fine. But I'm picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right?
Applejack and Rainbow Dash,Right!
Applejack,See? We're agreein' already.
Applejack,"Well, look at that. The path splits up ahead. Left or right?"
Smolder,Ugh. Here we go again.
Applejack,"Where to, Rainbow Dash?"
Rainbow Dash,I was thinking right... unless you want to go left. Because what makes you happy makes me happy.
Applejack,"Aw, heck. Forget about me. You want to go right, we'll go right."
Rainbow Dash,"But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you."
Applejack,"Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to you."
Yona,Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way!
Applejack,Hey! Where are y'all goin'?
Ocellus,I think we've gone in the same circle five times.
Sandbar,Only because someponies won't make up their minds about which way to go.
Rainbow Dash,"Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?"
Applejack,"Up to you, Rainbow Dash. I insist."
Rainbow Dash,"[chuckles] No, no. I insist."
Applejack,Heh. But I insisted first.
Silverstream,Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost.
Smolder,Ugh.
Smolder,We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back.
Rainbow Dash,"We knew that. All part of our plan. Right, Applejack?"
Applejack,"Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh... build a bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free. That is, if-if you think a bridge is a good idea."
Rainbow Dash,Only if you want to build a bridge.
Gallus,Stop! Listen. We can just fly everyone over and be done.
Applejack,Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork.
Rainbow Dash,Cooperation!
Applejack,Togetherness!
Rainbow Dash,You are so right!
Applejack,Only as right as you are!
Smolder,Okay! We'll build a bridge! What do we use?
Applejack,I'm goin' with your idea! Vines! No buts about it!
Rainbow Dash,I-I'm building with your idea! Branches! End of story!
Applejack,[muffled] Why use a branch when you can use a vine? [grunting] Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Why didn't I think of branches to begin with? They're so<U+0097> [yelping] ...easy to work with.
Applejack,"[muffled] Come on now... [grunting] These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash!"
Applejack and Rainbow Dash,[screaming] Help!
Ocellus,"Uh, at least now they're agreeing on something."
Rainbow Dash,[grunting] I can't get out!
Rainbow Dash,Let me guess. Bite-acudas?
Applejack,Mm-hmm.
Applejack,And they look mighty hungry.
Sandbar,We gotta get our professors out of there! Anycreature have a plan?
Gallus,Leave 'em hangin'?
Silverstream,What?!
Gallus,I'm kidding! ...Kinda.
Ocellus,We need to work fast! And together!
Smolder,But mainly fast.
Applejack,"I hate to admit it, but<U+0097>"
Applejack,...this whole mess is kinda our fault.
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. No trophy is worth getting eaten over.
Applejack,So what do ya say? You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel?
Rainbow Dash,I thought you'd never ask.
Ocellus,Aah! Don't worry. I'm just the distraction.
Rainbow Dash,Ocellus?!
Applejack,[sighs] You nearly scared the cutie marks off us!
Silverstream,Need a lift?
Sandbar,"Welcome back, professors!"
Rainbow Dash,"Now, that was a rescue!"
Applejack,And y'all did it together!
Gallus,No big. Those fish weren't even a thing.
Ocellus,[chuckles] Oops. Sorry.
Silverstream,[giggles] Best... field trip... ever!
Twilight Sparkle,Huh? How was the field trip? What did you all learn?
Rainbow Dash and Applejack,Uhhhh...
Yona,Yak learn ponies smart!
Silverstream,Yeah! Professors Applejack and Rainbow Dash were such good teachers!
Gallus,It was kind of crazy genius. They showed us what not to do so we'd figure out what we should do.
Twilight Sparkle,Really...?
Sandbar,It took us a while to get it.
Smolder,Especially at the ravine. It would've been so much easier to just fly home.
Silverstream,"But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is."
Gallus,Yeah. That was super dangerous. Talk about commitment.
Ocellus,We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month. But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack.
Twilight Sparkle,Thank you for telling me. I'm so glad to hear your field trip was a success. I'll make sure to schedule another one right away.
Twilight Sparkle,"[to Rainbow Dash and Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you?"
Applejack,To tell you the truth... yeah.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, not all the time. I agreed with you for the whole nature walk."
Applejack,Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award!
Rainbow Dash,"You were the one doing the ""angling""!"
Applejack,[scoffs] You were more like fandanglin'!
Spike,"You said it, Big Mac. This is taking forever! I know it's wrong to cut corners when it comes to gifts from the heart, but this is an emergency, right?"
Big McIntosh,Eeyup.
Spike,Discord? A little help? Discord!
Spike,Yeah? Oh! Good idea! [clears throat] Captain Wuzz! Are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
Discord,"Huzzah, fellow adventurers! Shall we storm the ramparts of Squizard's castle to reclaim Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility?"
Discord,"You did summon me for a rousing Guys' Night of Ogres & Oubliettes, did you not?"
Spike,"Uh, sort of. But do you think you could magically hurry up this pie real quick first?"
Discord,You seem to be mixing up [poof!] the Lord of Chaos [poof!] with a second-rate clown magician for hire.
Big McIntosh,Eee... wait!
Spike,"This needs to go in the mail today, or it'll never get to Sugar Belle in time for Hearts and Hooves Day!"
Discord,Please. Can't you see that that holiday is a commercialized ruse pushed on you by the greeting card industry?
Discord,Keep your eye on the pie. [<e0> la Doug Henning] It's magic time!
Discord,[sniffing] This smells... uh... palatable.
Spike,"Well, pies really are Sugar Belle's thing. But I think that makes this all the more special. It shows you're interested in what she cares about."
Big McIntosh,Eeyup!
Spike,And he's planning a big romantic Hearts and Hooves dinner. It was my idea to bake the invitation inside.
Discord,"[reading] ""Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me in my barn at sunset for a surprise."""
Spike,"Pretty clever, huh?"
Spike,"Awww. ""Sugar Belle"". See?"
Discord,"Well, you two certainly have bought into this romance nonsense hook, line, and sinker."
Spike,"For a formerly friendless immortal despot, you're pretty cynical."
Discord,"I'm a realist. And love, like all things warm and fuzzy, isn't real."
Spike,"Aw, come on. You act tough, but deep down, you're a softie. I mean, you don't have tea with Fluttershy every weekend because you like tea."
Discord,"But I do like tea! Every tea! All the teas! Chamomile, Earl Grey, green, white, yellow, mate, lemon, ginger, chai, spearmint, peppermint, hibiscus... [inhale] ...cinnamon, pumpkin spice."
Spike,"Tell you what. While Big Mac mails his incredibly romantic gesture, I'll show you the splendors of Hearts and Hooves Day in Ponyville. I bet I can prove you believe in love."
Discord,Fine. Call it a gentleman's wager. Loser mows my lawn for eternity.
Spike,"Is it, like, a riding mower or...?"
Discord,Tweezers!
Apple Bloom,"Hear ye, hear ye! This special Hearts and Hooves Day meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! First order of business <U+0096> helpin' my big brother decorate the barn for his big date with Sugar Belle tonight, and... Hello?"
Sweetie Belle,It seems like everypony's got somepony special but us.
Scootaloo,When's it gonna be our turn?
Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo,Huh?
Apple Bloom,Huh?
Scootaloo,[gasps] Who's it from?
Apple Bloom,"Can't tell. It's all smudged, but it looks like it's addressed to... ""Belle""? Hmmm..."
Sweetie Belle,"[gasps] ""Sweetie Belle""!"
Sweetie Belle,Somepony certainly went through a lot of trouble for me! On Hearts and Hooves Day!
Scootaloo,[gasps] You don't think...
Sweetie Belle,Could it be...?
Apple Bloom,"Hang on a minute. Mysterious package, smudged address, no idea who it's from... Hm. I know what this is. You've got a secret admirer!"
Spike,"[sighs] Another Hearts and Hooves Day. Love is in the air, Discord. Look at all these happy couples."
Discord,How can they be happy if they aren't playing Ogres & Oubliettes?
Spike,"As a great dragon poet once wrote to his beloved, ""I love you with the utmost clarity. I love you, dear. My sweet, sweet Rarity<U+0097>"" Are you even listening?!"
Discord,"Of course. ""Love is... something-something, and Discord is great."" I don't know. Can we play O&O now?"
Spike,"Sure, after you admit you believe in love and... Sugar Belle!"
Spike,Big Mac's girlfriend. What's she doing in town so early?
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Well, Sugar Belle, I'm sure Big Mac won't be expecting it."
Spike,[gasps] She's planning her own romantic surprise for Big Mac? What if she goes to Sweet Apple Acres before Big Mac's ready with his surprise? We've gotta warn him!
Big McIntosh,"[singing] ...ffle, cookin' a souffle..."
Spike,Aah!
Big McIntosh,Whoa!
Spike,"[slurring] Mig Bac... Mig Bac...! [groans] I mean, Big Mac! We just saw Sugar Belle! She's at Sugarcube Corner! But I think she's on her way over here now! You gotta keep her away from here until the barn's finished!"
Big McIntosh,[gasps] Eeyup!
Spike,I wonder what she has planned for him.
Spike,Aah!
Spike,Ugh! Will you warn me next time you do that?
Spike,"Ohhhh. She hasn't seen him yet. Take note, Discord. This is what love is all about."
Discord,"""Spike <U+0096> Love is about spying in the bushes."""
Spike,Make fun of me all you want. But look at Big Mac's face and tell me you don't believe in love.
Sugar Belle,I hope he'll be okay without me.
Spike,Oh. Hey. We're just... not spying<U+0097>
Big McIntosh,Hush!
Sugar Belle,"I mean, he has been on his own before. So he'll be fine, right? [sighs] How should I tell Big Mac tonight? ""You won't need to come visit me in my village anymore""? ""We need to talk."""
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. Just be honest with him.
Sugar Belle,"You're right. Okay! ""We're finished."""
Discord,You're right. She did surprise him.
Spike,Ugh.
Spike,"Okay. Things seem bad. Maybe they're really not. Maybe ""we're finished"" was about the day. Ponies say that, right? Like-like, ""Hey, remember yesterday? That's finished, 'cause it's today!"""
Spike,"Maybe not that. Oh, I know! Maybe Sugar Belle has a wacky cousin who's never been on his own, and she has to leave him in charge of her shop while she apprentices with Mrs. Cake, who does that, like, two days a week. N-No, no, three. That's why she won't need you to come to her village anymore, because... she'll already be here!"
Spike,Nah. I don't even buy that one.
Discord,"Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac. And over a girl, no less. I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night [poof!] right now to cheer you up."
Discord,Class is now in session.
Discord,Lesson one <U+0096> nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself. You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love. Observe.
Discord,"This is how cool guys lean against things. When you see a guy leaning against a thing looking this cool, you think, ""Wow! That guy doesn't have a care in Equestria. Not a guy who leans on things that cool."""
Spike,I don't think leaning's gonna help. Am I doing it right? Whoa!
Spike,"We're not like you, Discord. We can't put on a front and pretend not to love. It's impossible."
Discord,"Lesson two <U+0096> plenty of ponies in the pasture. Right, Big Mac? I know just the gal to make you forget all about Sugar Belle."
Big McIntosh,You... said... her... [wailing] naaaaaaame!
Apple Bloom,"Okay. We finished decoratin' the barn for Big Mac, which means we got the rest of the day to ourselves. There's a whole town of possible admirers out there and only three of us. But together, we're gonna get to the bottom of this! Ready? Break! Excuse me! Pipsqueak? Mind answerin' a few questions? No? Late for somethin'? Are you Sweetie Belle's secret admirer?!"
Scootaloo,[to Button Mash] Excuse me! I'm doing a research survey about sending pie in the mail anonymously. Would you say you're pro-that or anti-that?
Sweetie Belle,"[to Snips and Snails] Happy Hearts and Hooves Day! Did you boys happen to send any packages to me recently? It's okay to say no! I won't be offended! [whispering] Please say no, please say no, please say no."
Spike,Wow. You're really going all out to cheer up Big Mac. I'm impressed.
Discord,"Yes, yes, I'm amazing. Anyway, since we're in the neighborhood, care for a quick game of Ogres & Oubliettes? Like I've been wanting to play all week?!"
Spike,I take it back.
Discord,I'm helping our friend first and foremost. See for yourself.
Spike,I think he's showing her a picture of Sugar Belle.
Discord,What?
Spike,And now he's crying.
Discord,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. No, he's not. Let me see that."
Spike,Don't touch it! I'm looking!
Discord,Give me that!
Spike,"Cut it out! Discord, quit it!"
Big McIntosh,"She used to do this thing where her-her nose would wrinkle when she laughed. Right there, in that hole where your nose used to be. I never told her how much I loved wrinkle-nose cutie-face... [wailing] and now I never will!"
Spike,"Okay. I think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos remedies for a broken heart. You know what I do when I have a problem too big to solve? I hide from it! When she can't find you, she'll realize how much she misses you. Plus, if she can't find you, she can't break up with you."
Big McIntosh,Eeyup. Hup!
Spike,Ha!
Scootaloo,[sighs] I don't get it. We asked every stallion in Ponyville.
Apple Bloom,[groans] There's gotta be somepony we're missin'. Somepony obvious. Somepony right in front of our noses.
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, well. At least the barn's looking great for Big Mac's date."
Discord,Too bad there won't be a date.
Sweetie Belle,Sugar Belle is so lucky to have a non-secret admirer like Big Mac.
Discord,"Well, she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it."
Apple Bloom,"I bet she's gonna take one look at this barn and say, ""What did I ever do to deserve this?"""
Discord,"[whispering] Yes, what did she do to deserve this?"
Big McIntosh,She broke my heart.
Discord,"Well, not yet, technically. In fact, she can't break your heart if you break hers first."
Big McIntosh,[angrily] Eeyup!
Sugar Belle,"Thanks for the tour of Ponyville, Mrs. Cake."
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, my pleasure."
Sugar Belle,"I'm off to surprise Big Mac with the news. Imagine the look on his face when I tell him, ""We need to talk."""
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, dear me, no! I told you, don't say it that way or he'll think you're breaking up with him."
Sugar Belle,"Break up with him? Never! Why, without my favorite delivery pony, I couldn't imagine being happy ever again. He knows that."
Sugar Belle,"He's a good listener, that pony. I promise you, no mix-ups."
Sugar Belle,Ah! Big Mac!
Big McIntosh,Sugar Belle... we need to talk.
Big McIntosh,I know why you're here.
Sugar Belle,You do?
Big McIntosh,But I have somethin' to tell you first.
Sugar Belle,"Oh, can I go first? I'm gonna be<U+0097>"
Big McIntosh,Stop.
Sugar Belle,Oh. Why don't we tell each other on three? One<U+0097>
Big McIntosh,It's over!
Sugar Belle,What's over?
Big McIntosh,You and me. It's over.
Sugar Belle,Ah... What?
Big McIntosh,We're breakin' up!
Sugar Belle,I... don't understand. Why are you breaking up with me? And why are you leaning like that?
Big McIntosh,I... don't know!
Sugar Belle,"Big Mac, please. Talk to me."
Big McIntosh,"I... You... [loud groan] This is why I don't like talkin'! Words can hurt! Words hurt! Goodbye, Sugar Belle!"
Apple Bloom,"Big Mac! Oh, thank goodness! You gotta help us with this."
Spike,"Ugh. Dude, how long have you been not hiding?"
Discord,Oh. I should probably have said something.
Big McIntosh,Y'all should go.
Spike,Did ya...? Did she...? Are ya...?
Apple Bloom,"Big Mac, what's goin' on? Where's Sugar Belle?"
Big McIntosh,Just go!
Sweetie Belle,But we worked so hard on this chart. I think we've almost cracked it. If you could just<U+0097>
Big McIntosh,Not right now!
Sweetie Belle,But I can't stand having a secret admirer who's too scared to tell me who he is!
Big McIntosh,Maybe he doesn't like talkin'!
Sweetie Belle,But that doesn't make any sense!
Big McIntosh,"Maybe he used to talk too much, and it only ever got him into trouble!"
Spike,"[sighs] What if you're right, Discord? What if love isn't real at all?"
Big McIntosh,"I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. I'm just mad, and I'm takin' it out on you."
Sweetie Belle,That's okay. I bet it felt good to get it out though.
Big McIntosh,"Actually, it did. Tellin' you how I felt just then... I gotta go!"
Spike,Big Mac! Where are ya goin'?
Big McIntosh,I gotta talk to Sugar Belle!
Spike,"Discord, you gotta use your magic and...! Guess you have better things to do. Big Mac's gonna need a miracle."
Sugar Belle,Oh. All the rotten luck...
Big McIntosh,"Caught ya just in time! We both know I don't like to say much, but I'm gonna say somethin' now. [sighs] Even though I'm hurtin', I wouldn't trade this feelin' for anythin'. Because it'd mean givin' up the good times we had, too. I only broke up with you because you were gonna break up with me. I respect your decision, and you should know you'll always be in my heart."
Sugar Belle,I didn't want to break up with you.
Big McIntosh,"But... you said you didn't need me to visit anymore. You said I'm gonna be on my own. I-I heard you said ""we're finished"" when I was hidin' in the bushes."
Big McIntosh,That sounds worse than it is.
Sugar Belle,"Oh, Big Mac! I was talking about my cousin! I have this wacky cousin who's never been on his own, but I have to let him run my shop on weekends. Which is why you won't be delivering to my village anymore because I'll already be here apprenticing with Mrs. Cake, who does that two days a week. No, three."
Big McIntosh,Wait 'til I tell Spike!
Sugar Belle,"I'd never break up with you! I suppose there's a lesson here somewhere about communication, talking instead of assuming, or eavesdropping is wrong. Wouldn't you say?"
Big McIntosh,Eeeeyup!
Big McIntosh,Hee-hee. Wrinkle-nose cutie-face. [kisses] You must've been awful confused at my breakin' up with you after you got my pie.
Sugar Belle,What pie?
Big McIntosh,You didn't get the pie I sent?
Sugar Belle,Mm-mm.
Big McIntosh,Or the invitation?
Sugar Belle,Uh-uh.
Big McIntosh,"Well, in that case... allow me to escort you to a Hearts and Hooves Day surprise!"
Apple Bloom,Mind if we join ya?
Sweetie Belle,"[chomp] [reading] ""Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me<U+0097>"""
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Sugar Belle?!
Scootaloo,You have got to be pulling our hooves!
Sweetie Belle,It was all a mix-up?!
Sweetie Belle,"Oh, it's funny. I've been sitting here feeling sorry for myself for not having a special pony on Hearts and Hooves Day. But remembering all the fun we had, I think I have two special ponies <U+0096> my two best friends."
Apple Bloom and Scootaloo,Awwwww...
Spike,[sighs] And so ends another Hearts and Hooves Day. Despite a bumpy start... and middle... and ending... lot of bumps today... love was in the air.
Discord,"So was confusion, apparently, and a fair number of assumptions."
Spike,"But you have to admit, after seeing everything Big Mac went through, love is a hundred percent real."
Spike,"Seriously?! Discord, come on! I can't believe you!"
Discord,Who do you think broke Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?
Discord,Ta-da! Happy Hearts and Hooves Day!
Spike,You old softie. [laughs] I knew you had a heart.
Discord,"Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know."
Spike,"Ogres & Oubliettes? I thought you'd never ask! Oh, and... just wondering. No biggie, but... is Skellinore gonna be there?"
Discord,"Spike, she's an imaginary one-dimensional paper cutout skeleton."
Spike,"Well, nopony's perfect."
Rarity,"I do appreciate you showing me the way to the phoenix nests, Spike."
Spike,"Anything for you, Rarity. Besides, I've been meaning to visit Peewee."
Rarity,He really was an excellent pet. I can't imagine why you set him free.
Spike,"Phoenixes aren't meant to be domesticated. Even in the wild, they like to keep to themselves."
Rarity,"Well, they are beautiful. A few of their feathers will add just the right splash of color to my latest<U+0097> Spike! What are you doing?"
Spike,"Uh, nothing!"
Rarity,Is there something wrong with your face?
Spike,[sighs] It's a stone scale. It isn't magical or anything like the call of the Dragon Lord. It's just... red. And itchy. [groans] And embarrassing.
Rarity,"Ooh, precious pants, that does look uncomfortable. But even I get the odd blemish from time to time. It's nothing to be embarrassed by. You could pay Zecora a visit. She makes a cream that works wonders. Just don't get the shampoo."
Spike,There's Peewee's parents! But I don't see Peewee.
Rarity,"Oh, maybe he moved out. Everypony has to leave the nest at some point."
Spike,Peewee!
Rarity,Perhaps you should pay Zecora a visit sooner rather than later.
Spike,"[sighs] I don't want anypony else to see this. Besides, I'm sure it'll clear up after a good night's sleep."
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe you're still asleep!
Twilight Sparkle,"It's nearly noon, and you promised to help me with my lecture for class today!"
Spike,Noon? Whoa! I slept like a rock! Which reminds me <U+0096> all that sleep probably cleared up my stone scale!
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Um, on second thought... [chuckles nervously] You can go back to sleep if you want."
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, what are you doing?"
Spike,Hiding from my hideous face!
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sure it feels terrible, but it's just a breakout. It's not the end of the world."
Twilight Sparkle,I used to get terrible breakouts any time I had a final exam with Celestia. Who probably never had a blemish her whole life.
Spike,"Well, I'm not in magic school."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, but these things can be stress-related. And you did spend yesterday with Rarity."
Spike,[chuckles nervously] What could possibly be stressful about that?
Twilight Sparkle,[groans] You could try Zecora. She makes a cream that<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,Fine. But you're still gonna help me practice my lecture.
Twilight Sparkle,[clears throat] The element of generosity and its importance in relation to the other Elements of Harmony<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] My lecture!
Spike,...indigestion. I'm so sorry!
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] It's okay. I'm sure I can rewrite the lecture from my notes. I have a lot.
Spike,I can help you with<U+0097>
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe you should leave the castle after all. And go somewhere less... flammable?
Spike,"Hey there, not handsome."
Rarity,"[singsongy] Oh, Spike! My, what a fetching ensemble you put together. Very noir-esque. [giggles] I believe Shadow Spade herself would approve."
Spike,"Uh, thanks."
Rarity,But I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking it off.
Rarity,"Sorry, you'll have to speak up. My ears are a little bit clogged or something. It's just that I absolutely must have a model for my phoenix feather dress, and nopony else is available."
Spike,"Sorry, Rarity, but I... I am super busy all day giving... tours of the school!"
Pinkie Pie,Really? I thought I was giving tours today. Guess not. Free day! Whee! Woo-hoo!
Spike,Classrooms are that way. [groans] Dorms are that way. [groans] Twilight's office is up there. This is a fountain.
Tourist Pony,"[panting] Could you slow down a bit? We've come a long way to see the school, and I don't wanna miss anything."
Spike,"Oh. Um, yeah. [wincing, scratching] Sorry."
Tourist Pony,I-Is something wrong?
Tourist Pony,"Uh, do all the dragons at this school suffer from scale issues?"
Spike,[low voice] I don't know.
Tourist Pony,What?
Spike,"[low voice, straining] I don't... know!"
Tourist Pony,"I-I'm sorry, did-did you say ""firework show""?"
Spike,"[echoing] This is the school library! It's one of the most serene spots on campus, where students can spend time in quiet reflection or study! What?!"
Smolder,"Could you please stop shouting? We're trying to do our homework, and it's kind of distracting."
Spike,[loud voice] Was I shouting?!
Smolder,"If you're trying to hide, you need to do a better job. All I had to do was follow the smoke."
Spike,"[low voice, straining] Leave me alone!"
Smolder,What?
Spike,"[low voice, straining] Leave! Me! Alone!"
Smolder,"I can't under... Was that ""sleeves made of foam""?"
Smolder,"[laughs] Wow! I have seen some pretty bad molts in my time, but yours takes the cake!"
Spike,Molts?
Smolder,"The molt? Super painful stone scales, fire burps, uncontrollable volume shifts? It's all part of growing up dragon. Congrats!"
Smolder,Oh. Sorry.
Spike,"No-no-no-no-no. The last time I grew up, I turned into a giant greedy monster."
Smolder,"Greed-induced bigness. That's totally different. The molt is completely normal. Every dragon goes through it. Pretty soon, you'll leave and strike out on your own."
Spike,Why would I do that?
Smolder,Have you been living with ponies your whole life?
Spike,Uh-huh.
Smolder,"Oh. Well, in the Dragon Lands, a molter's loved ones kicks them out at the first stone scale."
Spike,What? Why?
Smolder,"I think it's biological. We call it the ""molt effect"". I haven't even told you about the smell."
Spike,Smell? [sniffs] Ugh!
Smolder,"Yeah. I mean, I love my brother and all, but one whiff, and I was all ""See ya!"" [sniffs] Speaking of which..."
Spike,"Wait! Does the molt effect happen to ponies too? [gasps] Twilight already asked me to leave the castle today. If she kicks me out, where am I gonna live? I'm too young to grow up!"
Smolder,I'm sure you'll find a nice...
Smolder,"...hoard of gems to guard or a village to terrorize. Oh, now that dragons and ponies are friends, I guess that's off the table."
Spike,So no creature's gonna wanna be around me?
Smolder,"Oh, I didn't say that. That molt stench is a magnet for predators. Tatzlwurms, hydras, rocs..."
Spike,Dragons are scared of rocks?
Smolder,R-O-C-S. Rocs? Humongous birds of prey that can snack on a molting dragon like candy!
Spike,"[low voice] So Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?"
Smolder,"Seriously, I heard none of that."
Spike,"[loud voice] Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?!"
Smolder,Congrats!
Pinkie Pie,"[shouting] Hey! Is this the shouting closet?! Because I've got a free day, and I'm totally up for some shouting! [sniffs] [normal voice] Also, where's that brussel-sprouts-covered-in-cotton-candy smell coming from? Because it is really interesting."
Spike,"I didn't know where else to go. I can't take the chance that Twilight will kick me out. You aren't feeling any molt effects, are you?"
Zecora,"[nose plugged] When it comes to breakouts, I've seen all circumstances. But as with the molt smell... let's not take any chances."
Spike,"[scratches, sighs] Is there anything you can do to cure me?"
Zecora,The ailments you have aren't something to cure. The molt's a condition that dragons endure.
Spike,"[scratches] But if anypony sees or smells me right now, they'll be so grossed out, they'll avoid me forever!"
Zecora,"Perhaps we can lessen this strange molt effect. The smell is the most likely cause, I suspect."
Spike,[low voice] It's all so embarrassing.
Zecora,"I know you are speaking, but I can't hear a thing. Are you talking about teaching asparagus to sing?"
Spike,[low voice] I said it's [loud voice] embarrassing!
Zecora,"If the goal is to not have your friends all depart, perhaps your volume is where we should start."
Rarity,Zecora! Hello? Are you there?
Spike,[loud voice] I can't let Rarity see me like this! Please don't let her know I'm here!
Rarity,"[loudly] Oh, dear! I'm talking even louder than I thought, aren't I?!"
Zecora,I have volume concerns today by the scores. But it seems that I'm ready to help you with yours.
Rarity,"[loudly] Eh, I-I'm sorry?! I can't seem to hear anything! I was hoping you could help! I have no idea what happened! One minute, I was sewing phoenix feathers onto a dress, and the next I couldn't hear my own voice!"
Zecora,"Ah, the feathers of that bird can affect ponies' ears. It's a magic ailment I've treated for years."
Rarity,"[loudly] I only know you're talking 'cause your mouth is going up and down. [sighs, sniffs, coughs] [normal volume] Oh, goodness! I hope that incredibly pungent odor belongs to some sort of magical curative. [loudly] I hope you're not busy, but I must have my hearing back! It turns out that I talk to myself while I sew, and without that conversation, I simply can't think!"
Zecora,"It's a simple cure, and the directions are clear. Just one or two drops in each of your ears."
Rarity,"[sighs, normal volume] Oh, thank you. You're an ear saver. [loudly] Oh, and while I am here, do you have any blemish cream?! Spike is having some scale issues!"
Spike,[loud voice] You have no idea!
Rarity,"[gasps, normal voice] I think I heard something! [loudly] Your cure is working already!"
Zecora,The cream that you want is just over here. It's a popular potion for all creatures this year.
Rarity,"[sighs, normal voice] Thank you, Zecora."
Rarity,"[loudly] I don't mean to be rude, but I do think your hut could use an airing out!"
Zecora,"Rarity's gone. There's no need to hide. [sniffs, groans] Though I wonder if we should continue outside. Can't treat your symptoms down there on the ground. It's safe to come out. There's no ponies around."
Spike,I'm not hiding from ponies. I'm hiding from that!
Spike,Did I forget to mention the molt smell attracts predators?
Zecora,That's something that would've been quite nice to know! But it's not worth discussing right now! We should go!
Spike,"Okay, maybe this wasn't a good plan."
Rarity,"Oh, Spike. What are you doing here?"
Spike,Rarity! You have to get out of here! There's a giant roc trying to eat me! It's got Zecora!
Rarity,"Yes, what? [loudly] I was just at Zecora's, but I'm heading back! I can't read these instructions! Does this say ""two drops once a day"" or ""one drop twice a day""?!"
Spike,"Rarity, there's no time! We have to get help!"
Rarity,"[loudly] Yes, my ears are completely clogged! Why, Spike! Your stone scales look worse! Oh, here! I picked up just the thing. Ah<U+0097>"
Zecora,"Oh, I wish you'd escaped either claw of this bird! But the both of us trapped in the same one's absurd!"
Rarity,[loudly] What?!
Spike,[groans] Let my ponies go!
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, what are you doing?"
Spike,"If my stone scales didn't itch so much and we weren't in immediate danger, this would be [chuckles] really embarrassing!"
Twilight Sparkle,Danger?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I was headed to Zecora's to get some cream for your scales. I had no idea you were<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,Molt smell?
Rarity,[high-pitched] Twilight!
Spike,Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,Was that Rarity?
Spike,"And Zecora! I tried to save them, but it's all I can do to stop scratching long enough to dive out of the way when that bird attacks!"
Spike,"[gasps, sighs] Finally! I didn't think that itching would ever stop!"
Spike,What's happening?! I... I can't move!
Spike,What just... happened? Did I just sprout wings? I just sprouted wings!
Spike,Whoops.
Twilight Sparkle,Spike?! How did you get wings?!
Spike,I don't know! But they're pretty aweso<U+0096> Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,Do you think you can fly up and distract him while I work on freeing Zecora and Rarity?
Spike,"Hey, giant chicken! If you like dragons so much, come and get me!"
Spike,Greetings.
Twilight Sparkle,Spike!
Zecora,I know that the molt produced surprising things. But I'm glad that the last was a new pair of wings!
Rarity,"[loudly] Yes! And also, I'm glad you've got wings!"
Twilight Sparkle,This is amazing! I didn't know if you'd ever get wings. I'm so happy for you. Does it have something to do with this molt you were talking about?
Spike,"[sighs] It's what's been going on with me. The breakout, the fire burps. The molt is when dragons get older and start to change. I wish I could stop it, but I can't. I-I should go."
Twilight Sparkle,Go? What are you talking about?
Spike,"In the Dragon Lands, families make molters leave home. It's called the molt effect."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, this isn't the Dragon Lands, and molt effect or no, I don't want you going anywhere."
Spike,But I'm growing up. What if something even worse happens?
Twilight Sparkle,"You're supposed to grow up, but you'll always be you. And whatever happens, we'll get through it together."
Spike,Woo-hoo! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Look at me! Let's go home!
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, I don't need to carry you anymore, do I? You have wings."
Spike,"They are new, and I don't want to overdo it."
Rarity,"I can't believe you thought any of us would send you away because of some silly molt effect. [sighs] Even if the symptoms were slightly unsettling. And let's face it, the odor wasn't pleasant. Nopony would stop caring for you just because you were getting older. Everypony goes through changes, but sometimes change can be wonderful. Like being able to model for any length of dress! [giggles] Uh, a bit higher, darling, please?"
Spike,"I'm glad to help, Rarity. But don't you think there's wonderful things about flying that don't involve dresses?"
Scootaloo,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Scootaloo,Almost... there...
Apple Bloom,Ah! I can't wait! Twilight's school is supposed to be amazin' inside!
Sweetie Belle,[whispering] Rarity says there's never been a school like it!
Scootaloo,[grunting] I heard the students get to do tons of awesome stuff!
Apple Bloom,Do ya see anything yet?
Scootaloo,"Uh, yeah. It looks like a broom! And a dustpan and some buckets."
Sweetie Belle,That sounds like a closet.
Apple Bloom,Try another window.
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Scootaloo,Whoa...
Pinkie Pie,Whooooo's ready for cupcakes?!
Pinkie Pie,"Oh, they're not for you, silly. They're for sharing! First, say something nice like this. Ocellus, you are a great listener! Now you get to keep one cupcake and share one with another creature."
Ocellus,"Yona, you're really strong!"
Pinkie Pie,Ugh!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Whoa!
Fluttershy,"All right, students! It's time to meet some new friends!"
Applejack,"That's friendship in action, y'all!"
Sweetie Belle,Wow! And I thought our school was fun!
Scootaloo,Yeah! Miss Cheerilee never lets us play buckball in class. I know. I've tried.
Apple Bloom,"Hey! Why don't we go here instead? It's still school, right?"
Cutie Mark Crusaders,[cheering] Great idea!
Apple Bloom,[sighs] What could be better than learnin' friendship with your best friends?
Twilight Sparkle,"[clears throat] Good morning, class. Today, we're going to learn about friendship through the ages. Spike, slide one, please."
Twilight Sparkle,"Back in the days of Chancellor Puddinghead... Uh, Spike?"
Spike,"Huh? Sorry, Twilight. Still getting used to my new wings. They're pretty great, huh?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, Spike. As I was saying... Huh? What are you three doing here?"
Apple Bloom,We wanna go to your school!
Twilight Sparkle,But why?
Sweetie Belle,We wanna learn friendship!
Scootaloo,And play buckball!
Twilight Sparkle,"I see. Why don't you three come with me? Spike, you're in charge."
Spike,Yes!
Starlight Glimmer,"Hi, Twilight! Looks like you could use a guidance counselor's help! Hint, hint."
Twilight Sparkle,"No, thanks, Starlight. I've got this."
Starlight Glimmer,"[sadly] Great. Well, I'll just... go dust my office for the seventieth time."
Twilight Sparkle,"[to Cutie Mark Crusaders] I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but... you can't be my students."
Sweetie Belle,Why not?
Scootaloo,Isn't this place for everycreature?
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, but we teach friendship lessons here. You already know all about helping ponies in need and being there for each other."
Sweetie Belle,Can't you just give us a chance?
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Pleeeeeeeeeeeaaaase?
Twilight Sparkle,"You need Cheerilee's classes, not mine. Hurry up. You don't want late marks on your permanent record."
Students,O dragon! My dragon!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike?! What did you do?
Scootaloo,"[sighs] Well, I'm not giving up! I know we can prove we belong in this school!"
Sweetie Belle,Yeah! Um... how?
Apple Bloom,By showin' Twilight we've still got lots to learn about friendship. And I know just where to start.
Applejack,[grunts] What in tarnation? Apple Bloom! You know better than to leave our good tools out like that! And aren't you supposed to be on harvest duty right now?
Apple Bloom,"Eh, it's not like the apples are goin' anywhere."
Applejack,[stammering] What's gotten into you? Those chores are your responsibility! Farm work is family work!
Apple Bloom,"Sorry, Applejack. Maybe if I went to Twilight's school, I'd learn to be better at helpin' the family."
Applejack,"Ahhh. So that's what this is all about. Well, if it's learnin' you want, I'd be happy to give you a private lesson right now... [angrily] Startin' with cleanin' up all this equipment!"
Apple Bloom,Hmph!
Sweetie Belle,Please can I go to Twilight's school?!
Sweetie Belle,Please? Please?!
Sweetie Belle,How 'bout now?
Rainbow Dash,"So there I was, leading the Wonderbolt formation into a super dangerous Sundown Spiral, when suddenly... [imitates whooshing] There was a huge storm cloud in our way!"
Others,"""Citrine Spark"": What happened?"
Rainbow Dash,"My genius happened! I changed the routine on the fly! And because my crew are such tight friends, they followed me!"
Student 2,[gasps] What did you do?!
Rainbow Dash,Only the coolest thing ever! I flew up and<U+0097>
Scootaloo,Did a super-amazing half-twist into a backflip sonic rainboom?!
Rainbow Dash,Hey! I never told that story to my students before. Scootaloo!
Sweetie Belle,They're coming! Get ready!
Scootaloo,Look out!
Apple Bloom,[stiltedly] Look out! Whoa!
Scootaloo,[stiltedly] Hey! Watch where you are going!
Apple Bloom,[stiltedly] I was watching! Watching you drive like a crazy pony!
Scootaloo,"[stiltedly] Well, maybe if you did not drop apples all over the street, I would not have to!"
Fluttershy,Ooh. I've never seen Apple Bloom and Scootaloo argue like this.
Pinkie Pie,Yeah. They usually go together like candy canes and stripes.
Sweetie Belle,Whoa! Oof!
Apple Bloom,"[stiltedly] My apples? This is all your fault, Scootaloo!"
Scootaloo,"[stiltedly] Hey, Sweetie Belle is the clumsy one!"
Sweetie Belle,[stiltedly] I'm not talking to either one of you ever again!
Fluttershy,Goodness. They seem really upset.
Pinkie Pie,It's almost like they forgot they're friends.
Scootaloo,[quietly] I think it's working!
Sweetie Belle,"[stiltedly] You are so careless! [quietly] Good plan, Apple Bloom!"
Apple Bloom,"[stiltedly] Careless? I will show you who is the one who is careless! [quietly] And great acting, Sweetie Belle!"
Scootaloo,[out loud] We're an awesome team!
Apple Bloom,All right!
Pinkie Pie,Yay!
Apple Bloom,Oops.
Pinkie Pie,You're friends again! I knew you would be! Candy cane stripes forever!
Scootaloo,Now they'll never let us into Twilight's school.
Apple Bloom,"Okay, we've tried shirkin' chores, pesterin', disguises, fightin'."
Sweetie Belle,Hmmm... We need to do something new. Something unexpected.
Apple Bloom,"Great idea, Scootaloo! We haven't tried cryin' yet."
Sweetie Belle,Yeah! It always works for Rarity.
Scootaloo,I wasn't crying. I think it's coming from outside.
Sweetie Belle,Aww. She looks so sad. We better go see what's wrong.
Apple Bloom,Hey. Are you okay?
Cozy Glow,Oh. Thank you for asking. But no. I'm having real trouble with... [sniffling] ...the School of Friendship.
Scootaloo,"Twilight won't let you go either, huh?"
Sweetie Belle,Really?
Cozy Glow,"I just moved here to go to school, but everything's so new and different. I don't know anypony."
Apple Bloom,"Well, now you do. I'm Apple Bloom. This is Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo. We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders."
Cozy Glow,"[sniffs] I'm Cozy Glow. It's very nice to meet you, but I don't know if I'll stay long. I'll probably flunk out. I'm having so much trouble with my friendship lessons."
Sweetie Belle,We can help with those!
Scootaloo,We know all about friendship!
Apple Bloom,And studyin' with you would be almost as good as bein' in class!
Cozy Glow,But why would you help me? What's in it for you?
Sweetie Belle,"That's how friendship works. When you give from your heart, you don't expect anything back."
Cozy Glow,"Well, golly, if you really mean it..."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Uh-huh!
Cozy Glow,I could use some help with my homework. I have to do something nice for each of these ponies. But I don't know anything about them. And it's so hard to talk to ponies you've never met.
Apple Bloom,"Well, you're in luck, 'cause we know all of those ponies!"
Scootaloo,Get ready for a friendship A-plus!
Scootaloo,"That's Bon Bon. If you wanna do something nice for her, first you gotta figure out what she needs."
Cozy Glow,"Well, how am I supposed to do that?"
Scootaloo,Just pay attention. Friendship is about listening to others.
Sweetie Drops,Ow. Ow.
Scootaloo,"Uh-oh. That cactus keeps pricking her every step she takes. Hmm, if only there was something to protect her from those spines."
Sweetie Drops,Thank you! That's so thoughtful.
Cozy Glow,I did it!
Scootaloo,"Good job! But, uh, next time, maybe don't give away my helmet."
Cozy Glow,Oopsie.
Sweetie Belle,"Green, purple, yellow. And one more purple. Whew. Sorting all those took longer than I thought."
Cozy Glow,You really think Mrs. Cake will like these new sprinkle shakers?
Sweetie Belle,Mm-hmm. Now she won't have to use rainbow sprinkles all the time. She can just pick the color she wants!
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Ooh! I'm sorry, I was out to lunch. Were you fillies waiting for me long?"
Cozy Glow,"No. Um, these are for you!"
Mrs. Cake,"Mrs. Oh, well, what a lovely surprise! I can't wait to try them out!"
Mrs. Cake,Mrs. Look! I made rainbow sprinkles! Aren't they wonderful?
Sweetie Belle,At least she likes her present?
Cozy Glow,Uh-huh...
Cozy Glow,Golly. How'd you know that would make him so happy?
Apple Bloom,Friendship means pitchin' in to help others' chores go faster. 'Specially when their special somepony's waitin' for 'em.
Scootaloo,[groans] That class was so boring!
Sweetie Belle,Not even Miss Cheerilee can make the history of radishes exciting.
Apple Bloom,I bet they don't have to learn about that stuff at Twilight's school.
Cozy Glow,Guess what! I got an A on my homework!
Apple Bloom,Nice goin'!
Cozy Glow,And I never could have done it without your help!
Sweetie Belle,No problem!
Scootaloo,We just wish we could have done more.
Cozy Glow,"Actually, you can. Headmare Twilight is giving us a big test at the end of the week, and I could really use your help studying."
Apple Bloom,We wanted to go to Twilight's school more than anything. But helpin' you has been even more fun! You can count on us!
Cozy Glow,Um... intelligence?
Cozy Glow,Laughter?
Sweetie Belle,Yes!
Cozy Glow,Is it... control?
Cozy Glow,Kindness! Loyalty! Honesty! Generosity! Laughter! Magic!
Apple Bloom,How'd the test go?
Sweetie Belle,Were there essay questions?
Scootaloo,Did you remember what we taught you?
Apple Bloom,But how could Cozy Glow fail her friendship test?
Twilight Sparkle,Ahem. I'd like to see you three in my office!
Scootaloo,"[quietly] I know we wanted to be invited inside, but it kinda went different in my head."
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe you'd do something like this!
Apple Bloom,Like what?
Twilight Sparkle,"You are Cozy Glow's tutors, aren't you?"
Scootaloo,We've been working with her for days!
Twilight Sparkle,That's what she told me. So you've been setting her up to fail?
Twilight Sparkle,"I know you're upset that I won't let you come to my school, but to teach Cozy all the wrong things out of spite... That's just cruel!"
Sweetie Belle,But we taught her all the right things!
Twilight Sparkle,"Then how do you explain these friendship test answers? [reading] ""What are the six Elements of Harmony?"" Five turtlenecks and a cheese grater? ""Who is the Princess of Friendship?"" Your mom?"
Apple Bloom,I... I don't understand.
Twilight Sparkle,Me neither. I never thought you three would pull such a mean prank. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to stay away from my school. And my students.
Cozy Glow,"Oh, no!"
Starlight Glimmer,Hmm? [dryly] Yay. Now I'll alphabetize them in reverse order. [sighs] Not much need for a guidance counselor at a school of friendship.
Starlight Glimmer,Aah!
Starlight Glimmer,"How much of that did you hear?! Uh, never mind."
Starlight Glimmer,[laughs nervously] Welcome! Can I get you a comfort pillow? Security blanket? Empathy cocoa?
Cozy Glow,"Uh, I just need some advice."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh! Well, I have plenty of that! Anecdotes, insight, midnight confessions... I'm babbling. [clears throat] Go ahead. I'm listening."
Cozy Glow,"I think I got my friends in trouble. They helped me study for my friendship test, and I failed it... on purpose."
Cozy Glow,"Well, the Cutie Mark Crusaders wanted to go to this school more than anything. So I thought if I showed Headmare Twilight they're bad at friendship, she'd let them come here with me."
Cozy Glow,I guess I still have a lot to learn about friendship.
Starlight Glimmer,"Actually, I think you're doing all right. Sure, that was a really, really bad way to try to help your friends, but what matters is you wanted to. The reason the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't go to this school is because they'd make better teachers than students."
Cozy Glow,So you do have a place for them here?
Starlight Glimmer,Hmmm...
Apple Bloom,"[groans] I bet there's no ""Wonderful World of Cleaning"" lesson at Twilight's school."
Sweetie Belle,[coughs] We'll never find out now.
Scootaloo,[sighs] I still don't get how Cozy failed her test after all that studying.
Sweetie Belle,Or how Twilight could blame us for it!
Apple Bloom,Or how gum can be so sticky!
Starlight Glimmer,"Sorry to interrupt, Miss Cheerilee. But can I borrow Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?"
Scootaloo,We didn't do anything wrong! We promise!
Twilight Sparkle,I know that. Now. Which is why I wanted to talk to you.
Sweetie Belle,Wait. So we're not in trouble?
Starlight Glimmer,"Just the opposite. Cozy Glow, is there something you'd like to say?"
Cozy Glow,This is all my fault. I messed up my test on purpose so we could all go to school together. I'm sorry.
Twilight Sparkle,"Thank you, Cozy Glow. Honesty is one of the pillars of friendship. [to Cutie Mark Crusaders] But you already know that. Which is why I'd like to give you these."
Applejack,"They're honorary diplomas, makin' y'all official graduates of this here school."
Rarity,You've more than earned them.
Rainbow Dash,Without even having to study!
Cutie Mark Crusaders,[chanting] We are graduates! We are graduates! We are graduates!
Twilight Sparkle,"And if you're interested, I think Starlight has a place for you at my school after all."
Cutie Mark Crusaders,Woo-hoo!
Starlight Glimmer,We could use some friendship tutors on staff. And I hear you're the best out there.
Apple Bloom,"Then what are we waitin' for? Let's get tutorin'! Come on, Cozy!"
Twilight Sparkle,And that's why this school needs you as our guidance counselor.
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] I've been planning this retreat for weeks, and we're already ten minutes behind! Where is that photographer?!"
Photographer,...No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Photographer,I'm so sorry! Can you forgive me? I don't expect you to forgive me... Forgive me?
Starlight Glimmer,Of course. I'll help you set up your<U+0097>
Photographer,"Princess Twilight, thanks so much for this! The Canterlot Historical Society is thrilled to document the friendship work your teachers do! Let me just pretty you all up!"
Photographer,Ooh!
Photographer,[giggles] Ooh!
Rainbow Dash,Ow! Hey!
Photographer,"Don't want a single hair out of place, do we? This is for the history books! Now..."
Photographer,"Well, that's that! Bye!"
Pinkie Pie,"Waaaait! You forgot Starlight! She needs a picture, too!"
Photographer,'Kay.
Photographer,Now I'll get out of your manes. I know how busy you are.
Photographer,Now I have everything I need.
Queen Chrysalis,"Yes, I know! We have been planning this for quite some time. [laughing evilly] Oh, thank you, Applejack. My spell can create a copy of anypony I desire. All I need is an image and a piece of the pony. [sniffs] Oh, and this."
Queen Chrysalis,"Why copies, Rarity? Because Princess Twilight and her friends control the Elements of Harmony, the most powerful weapon in all Equestria."
Queen Chrysalis,Which means you - will - be - able - to - use - them - too!
Queen Chrysalis,And serve me!
Queen Chrysalis,"Together, we will destroy Twilight Sparkle and her meddlesome friends!"
Queen Chrysalis,"With the Elements under my control, I'll build a new hive of Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi, and I will rule as Queen once again!"
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm. At least our retreat isn't too far behind schedule. Get ready for fun!
Rainbow Dash,"Are we talking fun fun, or learning pretending to be fun?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Both! We've all been so busy teaching, we've hardly had a chance to hang out with each other. And I may have scheduled some friendship activities as well!"
Pinkie Pie,Count me in! We can do friendship trust falls and pony pyramids! Oh! And hide and seek! Quick! Find me!
Fluttershy,"Well, I love the idea of some quiet time with my best friends."
Pinkie Pie,[screams] You found me!
Rainbow Dash,"Rarity, why is Applejack carrying all your stuff?"
Rarity,"Oh, that's not mine. Yes, I used to overpack a tad, but now it's just the essentials for me. I'm a simple filly."
Applejack,"Normally I wouldn't lug so much gear, but did y'all know this is Starlight's first time campin'?"
Starlight Glimmer,"I just never really felt the need to... ""hang out"" in nature."
Starlight Glimmer,"Home has books, tea, fewer bugs, a roof..."
Applejack,That attitude right there is why I brought the whole kit and caboodle. I'm givin' Starlight the full Apple family campin' experience!
Fluttershy,"Um, where are we camping?"
Twilight Sparkle,Right next to the Elements that brought us all together in the first place <U+0096> the Tree of Harmony!
Queen Chrysalis,Listen to your queen! We must retrieve the Elements of Harmony!
Mean Pinkie Pie,Hunting down some lame Elements? This is the worst day ever!
Mean Rarity,"Those Elements are mine! Along with this rock! Oh, and that twig!"
Mean Applejack,I got all kinds o' Elements right here under my hat. I'll let you see 'em for five bits.
Mean Rainbow Dash,[scoffs] Losers.
Mean Twilight Sparkle,Why didn't you just attack them?
Queen Chrysalis,Excuse me?
Mean Twilight Sparkle,You were close enough to pull hairs from their manes. Why not just take your revenge then?
Queen Chrysalis,They've defeated my army. I know better than to strike alone. I need<U+0097>
Mean Twilight Sparkle,Friends?
Queen Chrysalis,Servants! And the power of the Elements!
Mean Twilight Sparkle,Right. So where are these Elements of Harmony?
Queen Chrysalis,The location of the most powerful weapon in Equestria isn't something made known to just anypony. I learned they were hidden somewhere in this forest.
Mean Twilight Sparkle,"Yeah, well, it is a big forest."
Pinkie Pie,"Everypony, stop! And smell these roses! [sniffs] Ahhh! Oh, yeah!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[nervous giggle] Right. Roses. Fun. Now, let<U+0092>s try and stay on schedule."
Rarity,"Applejack, darling, anything in that wagon for mane maintenance?"
Applejack,"Uh, let's see here. Uh... all right. I got a bandana!"
Rarity,"Ugh, an entire wagon and no anti-frizz? Darling, you're not even prepared."
Applejack,"I am! For campin'? How ya doin', Starlight?"
Starlight Glimmer,Whoa! Ugh. [flatly] Great.
Fluttershy,"Oh, no! You and your sister fell out of your nest and got separated? That's terrible! Here. I'm sure your home isn't too far away."
Twilight Sparkle,"[yelps] Pinkie! If we keep stopping to have fun, we're never gonna get to the fun things I've got planned!"
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Good point! Last one to the Tree of Harmony is a parasprite! Whoo-hoo!
Mean Pinkie Pie,I'm sooooo bored. Are we there yet?
Mean Twilight Sparkle,Where yet? We don't even know where we're going!
Queen Chrysalis,"The quicker we search the forest, the quicker we find the Elements."
Mean Applejack,"I know where the Elements are. This, uh, here boulder just told me. I swear."
Mean Fluttershy,"You tried to fly out of the nest, but you fell and got lost?"
Mean Rainbow Dash,[yawns] Come get me when I should care.
Queen Chrysalis,Where... are... the others?!
Mean Applejack,"Uh... A, uh, a bugbear in... plaid socks flew down and, uh, g-grabbed them! Then disappeared! Huh. Craziest thing I ever did see!"
Queen Chrysalis,Turn around. We're going back.
Mean Twilight Sparkle,No. Keep searching. I'll find the others. We can accomplish more if we split our resources.
Queen Chrysalis,Very well. You have my permission.
Mean Twilight Sparkle,"""Permission""? You need us way more than we need you, your Majesty! The others are fools. But with me to lead them, there's no reason we can't find the Elements and keep the power for ourselves!"
Pinkie Pie,"You're it! Hey, how'd you get ahead of me? You're fast."
Mean Twilight Sparkle,Ugh! I'm looking for Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash.
Pinkie Pie,Aren't they back there?
Mean Twilight Sparkle,They are?
Pinkie Pie,Sure! Unless they're already at the Tree of Harmony.
Mean Twilight Sparkle,What is the Tree of Harmony?
Pinkie Pie,"Oh-ho-ho. This is one of your ""activities"", right? Like a friendship quiz? It's the crystal tree that holds the Elements of Harmony. Boom!"
Mean Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Where is it?
Pinkie Pie,[imitates buzzer] It's at the bottom of the stairs in the ravine by the Castle of the Two Sisters. Double boom!
Mean Twilight Sparkle,How do you know? You've seen it?
Pinkie Pie,"Mm-hmm. Honestly, Twilight, these questions are super easy."
Fluttershy,Right where you belong.
Fluttershy,"Oh, dear. This isn't where I belong. Oh, Rainbow Dash! I'm so glad you're here. I was lost."
Mean Rainbow Dash,Bummer. Later.
Fluttershy,What just happened?
Others,"Applejack, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, [overlapping] Fluttershy!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, fantastic. First Pinkie races ahead of us, and now Fluttershy's lost somewhere behind us. My retreat is off to a great start!"
Rarity,It's not like Fluttershy to disappear like this.
Applejack,"We'll split up and search for her. We can all meet back at the Tree. Starlight, take the navigation gear and<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,I'll find Pinkie Pie.
Mean Pinkie Pie,Bored. Bored. Bored.
Queen Chrysalis,This is ridiculous! Where are my other minions?!
Mean Applejack,"They're at a secret party up in that there tree. Run by a... squirrel named, uh, Jerome. But, uh, y-you need a password to get in."
Queen Chrysalis,[growls] Enough!
Queen Chrysalis,"You will go out there and find the others, you will bring them back here, and we will steal the Elements of Harmony so I can destroy Starlight's life like she destroyed mine! [through gritted teeth] Understand?"
Others,"Mean Rarity, Mean Applejack, [nervously] Uh-huh!"
Mean Applejack,"The party password is ""rutabaga""."
Mean Fluttershy,Oh. Nopony asked you. I hope you all freeze this winter!
Fluttershy,"Hello again, little friend. I think I may be walking in circles."
Fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, my! Where did you learn that kind of language? Um, excuse me?"
Mean Rarity,"Finally, you found her!"
Rainbow Dash,Me? We're looking for Fluttershy!
Applejack,Where's Starlight?
Mean Rarity,"Well, if I knew that<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,[grunts] Hey!
Mean Rarity,"This is mine! And this as well! Oh, and this is absolutely mine!"
Applejack,"Rarity, what in the hay are you gonna do with a fishin' rod?"
Rarity,"Starlight, darling, you're a gloriously bad camper. And coming from me, that is saying a lot."
Starlight Glimmer,I know. Want to break it to Applejack for me?
Mean Applejack,Who's breakin' what now?
Mean Applejack,Who are you?
Starlight Glimmer,"Very funny, Applejack. Still me under all this gear. Starlight."
Mean Applejack,"Starlight? How 'bout that? Y'all better come with me. It's, uh, dangerous out here."
Rarity,"Applejack, darling, are you all right? You look a little peaky. And where's your wagon?"
Mean Applejack,"Uh... stolen! Uh, I barely got away! Follow me, and I'll tell ya all about it."
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie! There you are! What are you doing?
Mean Pinkie Pie,You call that a pop?! Ugh!
Twilight Sparkle,I thought you were racing to the retreat.
Mean Pinkie Pie,"Please. Why would I waste my time on a boring, lame, no-fun retreat?"
Twilight Sparkle,What? Rainbow Dash! I think something's wrong with Pinkie!
Mean Rainbow Dash,Not my problem.
Pinkie Pie,Fluttershy! What's wrong?
Fluttershy,[crying] Everycreature is mad at me!
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] What?! That can't be right!
Mean Twilight Sparkle,[groans] Can we hurry this up? We're on a schedule here!
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight, your schedule can wait! Fluttershy's upset."
Mean Twilight Sparkle,"Well, tell her to get over it! I'll go get the others. Stay here!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, great. You upset Fluttershy, too?"
Pinkie Pie,"You know what, Twilight? Maybe if you weren't so worried about schedules, you'd realize you're the one ruining the retreat for your friends!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Well, if my friends don't care about the retreat I planned for them... maybe they should've stayed home!"
Mean Twilight Sparkle,Keep it together. You can do this. You need those imbeciles if your plan is gonna come together.
Queen Chrysalis,Your plan?
Mean Twilight Sparkle,"[gasps] Uh, the plan. I'm just trying to do your bidding, your Majesty."
Queen Chrysalis,Grub-sitting you six is nothing like controlling my hive! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just destroy you all and start over!
Mean Twilight Sparkle,Because I know where the Elements of Harmony are. You need me.
Mean Rarity,Mine. Mine! [crazed laughter] All mine!
Rainbow Dash,[to Applejack] I'm guessing some kind of curse? Maybe poison joke?
Applejack,"Well, somethin' sure ain't right."
Applejack,Hang on. I got a shovel we can use to whack those vines out of the way.
Mean Rarity,[grunting] I knew it! I knew you wanted it all for yourselves! You can't have it!
Mean Applejack,"...So there I was. Just me and, uh, a bucket of honey. Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket. Uh, b-but I-I survived all by myself in this here forest for, uh, a hundred and... twenty-seven hours!"
Rarity,Really? I can't believe you've never told us that story before.
Starlight Glimmer,She's making a point. We get it. You're the greatest camper in the history of Equestria.
Mean Applejack,"Well, I sure don't need any o' that silly stuff you're luggin' around."
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, the things you gave me are silly?!"
Starlight Glimmer,"[gasps, tearing up] Glad I was so entertaining for you!"
Rarity,"[to Mean Applejack] I'm going to make sure that she doesn't break a hoof out there, and then you and I are going to have a serious talk!"
Queen Chrysalis,Finally! There. That's all of you. Nopony leaves without my say-so.
Mean Applejack,"Now, wait a second. Weren't you just<U+0097>?"
Rarity,Starlight! Oh! Please stop running!
Starlight Glimmer,Ugh!
Rarity and Starlight Glimmer,Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,Of course I care about Fluttershy!
Pinkie Pie,Then you've got a super weird way of showing it!
Rarity,W-What in Equestria's going on here?
Pinkie Pie,"Twilight is so into her retreat that she doesn't even care if her friends are upset! She just wants us to ""stay on schedule""!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'm sorry, Pinkie! If I knew you thought this was a ""boring, lame, no-fun retreat"", I wouldn't have invited you in the first place!"
Pinkie Pie,I never said that!
Applejack,"Sorry, y'all. We would've been here sooner, but we had to take the long way after Rarity ran off with all my stuff."
Rarity,Wha<U+0097>?! I most certainly did not!
Applejack,What?! You know I ain't no liar! [to Starlight Glimmer] Where's all your gear?
Starlight Glimmer,Why? So you can laugh at me some more?!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, hey, we're all friends here!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Everypony, quiet! Listen. We know each other really well <U+0097> the great stuff and how to get on each other's nerves, too. I wanted a fun trip with my friends. But instead, I got carried away with plans and ruined everything. If you want to forget it all and head home, I won't be offended. I just want us to stop fighting."
Applejack,"[to Starlight Glimmer] Hey, sorry if I got carried away with all that campin' stuff."
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm sorry, too. I should've just told you I'll never like camping. Also, I'll never like camping."
Rarity,"Well, if we're all being honest, I can't survive with just this tiny yet fashionable little saddlebag! I miss my things!"
Pinkie Pie,[to Twilight Sparkle] I'm sorry that you thought that I thought your plan was lame. Your plans are the most un-lamest!
Rainbow Dash,And I always have fun when we're all together. Even if it's learning pretending to be fun.
Twilight Sparkle,So... does that mean you still want to have the retreat?
All except Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy,Yes!
Fluttershy,If everypony likes me again.
Twilight Sparkle,Let's get to that Tree. I have the whole campsite set up and ready.
Mean Pinkie Pie,[groans] What's this garbage?
Mean Applejack,Badger installation art! Ya see<U+0097>
Queen Chrysalis,Just! Retrieve! The Elements!
Mean Rarity,Mine! Mine!
Mean Twilight Sparkle,"Once we get the power of the Elements, no creature <U+0096> not even her Majesty <U+0096> can tell us what to do. Just follow my lead. Got it?"
Mean Rarity,Ooh! That one's mine!
Mean Fluttershy,"Oops. I'd say sorry, but I'm not!"
Mean Twilight Sparkle,"Stop it, fools!"
Queen Chrysalis,How dare you! I created you!
Mean Twilight Sparkle,Imbeciles! You ruined everythiiiiiiiing!
Queen Chrysalis,"Servants always fail you in the end! Just wait, Starlight. I will have my revenge!"
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Are you kidding me?
Pinkie Pie,[laughing] This was... the worst... day... ever!
Starlight Glimmer,"Come on, everypony. We can fix this campsite in no time."
Applejack,Spoken like a true camper.
Starlight Glimmer,"Eh, don't push it."
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, if we can survive a day like this, I think our friendship is strong enough to handle anything the world can throw at us."
Twilight Sparkle,Who can tell me what these are?
Sandbar,Whoa...
Gallus,Me likey...
Yona,Shiny!
Smolder,Treasure?
Ocellus,Nope! They're all legendary magical artifacts!
Ocellus,Heh-heh. I've read ahead in Equestrian Cultures and Camaraderie: Volume Seven.
Twilight Sparkle,"You're right, Ocellus. This is the Amulet of Aurora, the Talisman of Mirage, the Helm of Yksler, the Crown of Grover, Knuckerbocker's Shell, and Clover the Clever's Cloak."
Spike,"And the gems are real! Eh, not that I... tasted them."
Twilight Sparkle,"Princess Celestia gifted these to our school, since they each represent one of the cultures our students come from. And we'll learn all about them in a Spell-venger Hunt!"
Smolder,"[aside, to Sandbar] Is that a pony thing?"
Sandbar,Eh.
Twilight Sparkle,It's a magical scavenger hunt. Each of you will work in pairs to try to find where in the school these artifacts are hidden.
Spike,The team that finds the most wins a private tour of the Canterlot Archives with Princess Celestia.
Silverstream,[excited squeal] Learning and fun?! Does it get any better than that?!
Gallus,"You've been underwater a long time, haven't you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Gallus and Silverstream, sounds like you're our first pair!"
Twilight Sparkle,What? They'll make a great team.
Yona,"Um, why pony glowing?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait. You all were called on this friendship quest, too?"
Fluttershy,It must be a really important one.
Rarity,And terribly far away.
Rainbow Dash,Just getting there will take days!
Applejack,Do y'all know what this means? There won't be any teachers left to run the school!
Fluttershy,Should we send our students home?
Pinkie Pie,I say we take 'em with us! Road trip!
Applejack,Problem is we don't even know how long we'll be gone.
Twilight Sparkle,"Don't worry, everypony. I already have a seventy-point plan in place for this very situation."
Starlight Glimmer,You want me to be headmare?!
Twilight Sparkle,You're the perfect choice! You're a good leader and an expert in friendship. I trust you to run this school exactly as I would.
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, that's a pretty big responsibility, Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,Which is why I've prepared everything you need.
Twilight Sparkle,"The curriculum, rules for the Spell-venger Hunt, dining hall menus for the next six months..."
Spike,"Six months?! You're not really gonna be gone that long, are you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"...and Spike. Anything that isn't covered in my files, he'll be able to help you with."
Starlight Glimmer,Then why not put him in charge?
Spike,"No-ho-ho, thanks. Eh, being a princess for Twilight was hard enough."
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm gonna pretend that made sense. But if you're sure it's what you really want, I promise I won't let you down."
Twilight Sparkle,I knew I could count on you.
Starlight Glimmer,Great. What could possibly go wrong?
Spike,"Goodbye, Rarity! A-And everypony!"
Starlight Glimmer,Come back soon! Please!
Starlight Glimmer,Huh?
Discord,"[through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces."
Starlight Glimmer,"Discord! What a... heh... nice surprise! This is your first time at our new school, isn't it?"
Discord 1,"Oh, was I not invited to the grand opening?"
Discord 2,Friends and Family Day?
Discord 3,Baccalaureate?
All three Discords,I hadn't noticed.
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, at least you're here now. Um, why are you here now?"
Discord,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?"
Spike,Then you also must've heard Starlight is in charge now.
Discord,Really? I thought there must be some mistake.
Starlight Glimmer,Nope. Twilight picked me for the job. And she left pretty detailed instructions for me to follow.
Discord,"[writing] ""Item one <U+0096> Gravity is optional."""
Starlight Glimmer,Whoa-oa!
Discord,"""Item two <U+0096> The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset."""
Discord,"""Item three<U+0097>"""
Starlight Glimmer,"Not gonna happen. I promised Twilight I'd handle this her way. So thanks, but no thanks."
Spike,"Uh-oh. When we play Ogres & Oubliettes and he puts that many E's in ""really"", the things don't usually end well."
Starlight Glimmer,"Don't worry, Spike. Discord and I are old ""save Equestria"" buddies. He'll be fine. Now, what's next on Twilight's list?"
Spike,Okay. I hid the artifacts for the Spell-venger Hunt and ordered school supplies for the week. All you have to worry about is teaching class.
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] Thanks, Spike. Maybe we will get through this okay."
Spike,Twittermites?
Spike,Ow!
Starlight Glimmer,Discord! What are you doing?!
Starlight Glimmer,"[gags] We'll take it from here, Discord. Go relax. Have a cup of tea. At home."
Discord,Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.
Spike,"Actually, that does sound kinda helpful. And it was next on our to-do list."
Starlight Glimmer,Which teachers did you hire?
Iron Will,"They call it ""making friends"", because you have to make creatures be your friends! Show me what you've got, yak!"
Yona,"[clears throat, quietly] Be my friend."
Iron Will,"If you're quiet, I don't buy it!"
Yona,[louder] Be my friend!
Iron Will,I've heard pudding that's more convincing!
Yona,"[huffs, even louder] Be! My! Friend!"
Starlight Glimmer,[quietly] That's not how Twilight teaches friendship.
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"Some field trip! Where's my iced tea?! [sips, gulps, spits] This is too cold! [sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too hot!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,"[sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too tea-flavored!"
Cranky Doodle Donkey,You call yourselves friends?!
Spike,That is definitely not how Twilight teaches friendship.
Starlight Glimmer,You hired a tree as a teacher?!
Discord,Its schedule was free.
Spike,"Uh, guys? That's not just any tree."
Spike,[blows nose] It's a dragon-sneeze tree.
Starlight Glimmer,"W-W-W-Wait! Calm down, everycreature! It's gonna be okay!"
Yona,[yells] BE MY FRIEEEEENNNND!
Discord,"Mmmm, my, my, my. You do seem like you're in over your head. Won't Twilight be so disappointed with how you're ruining<U+0097>I mean, running her school?"
Starlight Glimmer,Discord!
Starlight Glimmer,This is all your fault!
Discord,Mine? I thought you were in charge here. But I'm happy to pitch in if you need me.
Starlight Glimmer,What I need is for you to leave!
Discord,Happy now?
Spike,"Come on, Discord. You know that's not what she means."
Discord,"Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!"
Starlight Glimmer,"[groans] Thanks, Spike. Let's just hope he stays gone."
Spike,I wouldn't count on it. I think Discord's trying to test you.
Starlight Glimmer,But why? I thought we were friends.
Spike,"Well, it's kinda what he does. Even to ponies or dragons he cares about."
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, well, I'm ready for him. I told Twilight I'd run her school right, and I'm gonna keep that promise. No matter what."
Starlight Glimmer,"Good morning, students! I know there's been a little bit of adjustment since the professors left for their trip. But I've brought in new new teachers. And now everything should run smoothly. Now it's time for class. And don't forget, this afternoon is the Spell-venger Hunt!"
Discord,"[California accent] Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures!"
Discord,Is this seat taken?
Trixie,"Welcome, class! You may call me the Great and Powerful Professor Trrrrrri<U+0097>"
Discord,"Shhh! Really, that's so inconsiderate!"
Discord,"Oh, I better take this. Hello?"
Discord,"Oh, he did not! And what did you say?"
Discord,[gasps] You did not!
Trixie,Discord! Why are you here?!
Discord,"Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me."
Trixie,Of course I am! No fruit calls in my class!
Trixie,"Magic is the most important element of friendship. So, today I, the Great and Powerful Trixie, will put on a magic show!"
Discord,[chuckles] I'm learning so much. Aren't you?
Trixie,[growls] Discord!
Trixie,"Eh, hello?"
Trixie,"Um, what exactly is a long-distance plan?"
Discord,"Take a lap, team!"
Sandbar,"Uh, actually, we just finished Professor Spitfire's workout."
Silverstream,"I've never run so fast in my life! Oh, this is great!"
Sandbar,"[pants] Hey, coach, we need a break."
Starlight Glimmer,"Discord, that's enough! Endangering students crosses the line! I don't know why you're trying to ruin this school, but it stops now!"
Discord,I wouldn't be so sure.
Starlight Glimmer,This is your last warning.
Spike,"Hey-hey-hey! Take it easy, Starlight! Discord's your friend, remember?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, he's not acting like it!"
Spike,"[huffs] She's right, Discord. What's your problem?"
Discord,"My problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school my problem?!"
Starlight Glimmer,[nervous laughter] Don't worry. I just banished him from school grounds forever. He's fine.
Spike,That probably made things worse. Why didn't you just talk to Discord?
Starlight Glimmer,Because he's right about one thing. I've been doing a terrible job as headmare.
Spike,"No, you haven't. Discord is just bein'... Discord."
Starlight Glimmer,Maybe. But I wonder why me being in charge bothers him so much.
Spike,We can figure that out after the Spell-venger Hunt. C'mon!
Starlight Glimmer,"For this afternoon's Spell-venger Hunt, you'll need to use the artifacts' history to find where they're hidden in the castle. When you spot one, touch it with a magic shield to keep track of your score."
Spike,Twilight left the list of your hunt partners before she left. I'll pass out the shields.
Starlight Glimmer,Ready... set... Spell-venger Hunt!
Spike,C'mon! We can use Twilight's observatory to watch the teams!
Smolder,I hope you know where you're going.
Ocellus,To the Helm of Yksler!
Smolder,"Eh, works for me."
Ocellus,"In our book, it says Yksler was an honorable yak warrior. Any enemies that saw him put down their weapons in peace. I think his artifact must be in one of these suits of armor."
Smolder,I'm guessing that one.
Ocellus,"Yes! One down, five to go!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Awww, Ocellus and Smolder found their first artifact! Wait. What's that?"
Ocellus,"Uh, I don't think that's part of the Spell-venger Hunt!"
Ocellus,The school is haunted!
Smolder,And not cool!
Silverstream,We're totally gonna win this Spell-venger Hunt!
Gallus,"Yeah, I doubt that. But at least I know where one of the artifacts is. Saw Spike hide it yesterday."
Gallus,The Crown of Grover! Score!
Gallus,"They say it's magic and King Grover used it to become the first ruler of Griffonstone. I know, pretty sweet, right?"
Silverstream,You paid attention in class!
Gallus,What?! I-If you ever tell an<U+0097>
Gallus,Whoa!
Silverstream,3D painting!
Starlight Glimmer,"Yup, that's definitely Discord. This is not good."
Spike,I thought you banished him from the school.
Starlight Glimmer,"Only his body. Apparently, his ghost can come and go just fine. Let's go. We have to stop this."
Spike,"How? No offense, but I don't think magic is the answer against Discord."
Starlight Glimmer,"This time, I'm not using magic."
Yona,Hmm... What Yona look for?
Sandbar,"The Shell of Knuckerbocker. It's like a seashell, but if you blow into it, you call a dragon! There's a sweet poem in our book about it. ""Climb to the heights with dragon flight."" [gasps] Like flight of stairs!"
Yona,Yona take pony word for it.
Yona,Huh?
Sandbar,[grunts] What's happening?!
Yona,Ugh! Yona not know! But Yona do know Yona not like Spell-venger Hunt!
Discord's Ghost,Discord' [laughing] Boo! Boo! Boo!
Ocellus,[yelps] Whoa!
Starlight Glimmer,"Everycreature, stop!"
Silverstream,B-B-B-But the school is haunted!
Starlight Glimmer,It's not haunted. It's Discord.
Discord's Ghost,"Discord' Headmare Starlight! Look at me! Look! I won the Spell-venger Hunt! Well done, me! Now what's my prize?"
Spike,Detention.
Discord's Ghost,"Discord' Well, that's disappointing."
Starlight Glimmer,"Discord, you can't keep messing up the school."
Discord's Ghost,Discord' On the contrary. I think I rather can. And will.
Starlight Glimmer,Then I have just one thing to say to you.
Discord's Ghost,"Discord' Oh, do go on."
Starlight Glimmer,I'm sorry.
Discord's Ghost,Discord' What?
Starlight Glimmer,I had to stop thinking like a headmare and start thinking like a guidance counselor to finally understand. You felt left out.
Discord,Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.
Starlight Glimmer,"Nopony ever invited you to the school. And when you offered to help, I didn't listen. I was so worried about doing things Twilight's way, I didn't stop to think about being a good friend. I'd like to apologize for that. And offer you the job of vice headmare."
Spike,Huh?
Silverstream,Really?!
Gallus,What?!
Ocellus,Why?!
Yona,No!
Smolder,Him?!
Sandbar,Totally confused.
Discord,"I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space..."
Spike,"You're new to the world of education, aren't you?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Next time you want something, just ask for it, all right?"
Discord,But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.
Spike,Hey! Watch the wings!
Starlight Glimmer,"Now, Vice Headmare Discord, if you'll help me get this Spell-venger Hunt back in order."
Discord,[snaps fingers] Everything is re-hidden.
Discord,"[chuckles] Well, with a few surprises."
Twilight Sparkle,Discord! I can't believe you tricked us into going on a friendship quest that wasn't real!
Discord,"Oh, back so soon?"
Rarity,A glamour spell on our cutie marks?
Rainbow Dash,A fake summons from the map?
Pinkie Pie,"Hey, at least we got to go spelunking in that really creepy cave with all those eyeless worm creatures chasing us."
Yona,"Oh, Yona so glad ponies back!"
Applejack,"Uh, y'all get the feelin' we missed somethin'?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Thanks for taking care of the school, Starlight."
Starlight Glimmer,It was a challenge. Heh. But I think things turned out just the way you'd have handled them.
Spike,[to Discord] Guess this means you're not vice headmare anymore.
Discord,"Oh, poo! I just ordered business cards!"
Sandbar,Ponies' voices fill the night Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
Others,"Come on, everycreature! Sing!"
Sandbar,"La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la"
Ocellus,[hesitantly] La-la-la-la... la...
Yona,"Not everycreature celebrate same way, you know."
Smolder,Yeah. Dragons don't do pony holidays.
Spike,Sure we do! I love Hearth's Warming Eve! It's all about friends and presents and family and... presents!
Twilight Sparkle,"It's also about putting aside differences to come together, like the Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns did on the first holiday."
Ocellus,Oh! Is that why you put their Fire of Friendship on top of the tree? To help us remember their unity?
Rainbow Dash,And 'cause it looks cool.
Silverstream,This is my favorite day of the year! [giggles] Not that I don't like the other ones. Tuesdays are great!
Yona,Yona like any day that is start of winter break.
Gallus,Two whole weeks without classes. How will Ocellus survive?
Twilight Sparkle,"I think you'll all enjoy the time off to be home with your families. To celebrate your own traditions. Attention, everycreature! School is officially out! Happy holidays, and we'll see you after the break!"
Twilight Sparkle,And for those of you traveling outside Equestria...
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, shouldn't you guys be getting ready to go? If you miss that train, it's a really long walk."
Twilight Sparkle,"Go pack up, and we'll take you to the station."
Spike,"It's that new bowtie I wanted, isn't it?"
Twilight Sparkle,You'll have to wait and see.
Spike,"I'm waiting! But in the meantime, I'm shaking!"
Spike,Wha... What happened?!
Twilight Sparkle,Everything's ruined <U+0096> that's what's happened!
Rainbow Dash,And I don't think it was an accident. Somepony was up here!
Spike,Over there!
Twilight Sparkle,Outside!
Spike,That's the students' quarters!
Rainbow Dash,"Might as well give up, whoever you are! We got ya cornered!"
Twilight Sparkle,Hello? Is anypony there?
Rainbow Dash,I'll check the back door!
Silverstream,What's happening? [gasps] Another decorating party?
Twilight Sparkle,Has anycreature come in here?
Smolder,"Well, yeah. All of us did. To pack? Like you told us to?"
Spike,After that. Did you hear anything?
Silverstream and Smolder,Uh-uh.
Gallus,What's up?
Yona,Yona done packing!
Ocellus,Is something wrong?
Rainbow Dash,[grunts] The back door's locked! No way out!
Twilight Sparkle,But whoever did it had to have come in here! We saw them!
Ocellus,Whoever did what?
Sandbar,Whoa... That is so not cool.
Spike,"And whoever did it ran into your rooms. No one came out, and all of you are still here."
Rainbow Dash,One of you must have done this! But... why would any of you want to sabotage Hearth's Warming Eve?
Yona,Ugh! Yak not do this! Yona offended by accusation!
Twilight Sparkle,"We don't know what happened. Maybe this wasn't even on purpose. But I want to give whoever caused this mess a chance to tell the truth and explain themselves. I'll make it easy for you. Close your eyes. Now, if you did this, raise your hoof. Or claw. Or whatever."
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Come on, Spike. Looks like we have to<U+0097> Spike, you can open your eyes."
Spike,What? Oh!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, what about me?"
Twilight Sparkle,You all can.
Twilight Sparkle,"But since nocreature took responsibility for this mess, you're all gonna have to help clean it up before you can go home."
Smolder,Why do I have to stay?!
Sandbar,"Aw, but the holidays!"
Twilight Sparkle,"While you're cleaning, we'll bring you into my office one at a time. Since honesty is one of the Elements of Harmony, we want to give you each a chance to tell us the truth."
Rainbow Dash,"And once we find out who did it, just you wait! We're gonna...! We'll...! What are we gonna do exactly?"
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] The guilty party won't be going home over Hearth's Warming break. She or he will stay here for some one-on-one friendship lessons.
Silverstream,But what if none of us confesses?
Twilight Sparkle,Then... [sighs] I guess there's no holidays for anycreature. You'll all stay over the break.
Twilight Sparkle,"All right, let's get to the bottom of this. Who wants to be interviewed first?"
Gallus,Eh. I'll go. Beats mop duty.
Silverstream,"Hey, I know! We can make a game out of this! See who finishes cleaning up first!"
Smolder,Let's save time and cut to the chase. Which one of you did it?
Ocellus,I would never do something this horrible! I love Hearth's Warming Eve! And I do not want to miss going home for it.
Sandbar,Huh. I didn't even know changelings celebrated Hearth's Warming.
Ocellus,"Oh, yes! It's our favorite holiday! Well, since Headmare Twilight shared it with us last year. She gave our hive very clear instructions."
Ocellus,"[clears throat, reading] ""Welcome to the traditions and fun of Hearth's Warming! Here's a guide to help you enjoy this celebration of pony history. Families start the holidays by putting the tree up!"""
Ocellus,"[reading] ""Thirsty? Dive into some holiday punch!"""
Ocellus,"[reading] ""Just before bed, everypony exchanges gifts."""
Ocellus,It doesn't say how long we keep doing this.
Ocellus,"[reading] ""And to finish celebrating, you can build a fire, light it up, and sing carols."""
Changelings,": Carols, carols, carols, carols, caroooools"
Sandbar,You might have misunderstood things just a little.
Ocellus,Eh. We may not have done everything exactly the way you do. But we made our own traditions! And I can't wait to do it all again this year!
Smolder,If we ever get out of here.
Twilight Sparkle,Ocellus? Your turn.
Silverstream,What happened?
Gallus,What do you think happened? I told her I didn't do it.
Yona,Ugh! Yona tired of waiting! Yaks always home for holidays!
Sandbar,"How do you celebrate Hearth's Warming in Yakyakistan, Yona?"
Yona,"Yaks do not. Our holiday much better. Is called Snilldar Fest. Night before, yaks gather things to smash and put them in big pile. Then in morning, we smash them! In afternoon, we smash them again! In evening<U+0097>"
Gallus,"So it's just about smashing stuff, like all your other holidays."
Yona,"No! How griffon get that idea? This holiday about so much more. Last year, for example. Most perfect Snilldar ever."
Yona,"[voiceover] Whole family <U+0096> grandpa, grandma yak, Yona's brother, sister, mother, father yak <U+0096> all go to woods singing yak song."
Yona and family,Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again! Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again! Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!
Yona,[voiceover] Calves in family pick out perfect smashing log. Then yaks smash it!
Yona,[voiceover] Then yak family build perfect snow fort... and smash it!
Yona,[voiceover] Then we hang perfect things on perfect moss pile and<U+0097>
All but Yona,You smash it.
Yona,"What you think yaks are, barbarians? Moss pile is for special family rituals. Last year, ritual for Yona."
Yona,[voiceover] All yak family gather around Yona and braid Yona hair for first time.
Gallus,"So, to recap... Your holiday is about smashing things and family."
Silverstream,"Happy Snilldar to you too, Yona! It's so cool to learn new traditions from new friends!"
Smolder,"Yeah, well, one of these new friends has gotten us all in trouble. And they'd better confess soon."
Ocellus,"Sandbar? Sorry, but they said they want you to go in next."
Silverstream,"Why the rush to get home, Smolder? Like you said, dragons don't really have holidays, do they?"
Smolder,Meh.
Ocellus,[gasps] That's so sad! You must do something in the winter for fun.
Smolder,"Well, we do have the Feast of Fire. Everydragon gets together and tells stories. The best one wins a pile of gemstones."
Yona,"Ooh, what story won last year?"
Smolder,"It was called ""A Dream Come True""."
Silverstream,"Come on, now you've gotta tell it!"
Smolder,"Ugh, fine. Once upon a time, there was this sad little dragon."
Smolder,[narrating] Her name was Scales. She lived alone in the wilderness with nothing to eat.
Smolder,"[narrating] But one night, as she sat alone in a storm, she heard something. It was the Dragon Lord! Scales was scared, but the Dragon Lord told her not to be afraid, that he was taking her to the Dragon Lands for a great feast."
Smolder,"[narrating] Scales sat with the Dragon Lord's family and friends and had the biggest, best dinner of gemstones she'd ever eaten! Then, while the dragons were telling stories, Scales thought it would be so easy to seize power from this feeble and sensitive Dragon Lord. She saw her chance... and took it!"
Smolder,"[narrating] She claimed the Bloodstone Scepter and took over the Dragon Lands! [as Scales, evil laughter] And forced the Dragon Lord to live out in the cold, just as she used to!"
Ocellus,That's a horrible story!
Smolder,"Maybe to you. But dragons like hearing about weak, kind creatures getting defeated."
Rainbow Dash,Silverstream! You're up! Let's go!
Smolder,"So, did you tell them you did it?"
Sandbar,What?! No way! Why would I say that?
Smolder,You already live in Ponyville. Staying here over break is no big deal.
Yona,School of Friendship good place for pony to have pony holiday.
Sandbar,I'd still rather spend it with my family at home. Oh! That reminds me! I have the best holiday story ever! It's called...
Sandbar,"[voiceover] ""The Day My Hearth's Warming Doll Almost Fell into the Fire!"""
Sandbar,"[voiceover] Just before we went to bed, my mom, my dad, and my sister all put our Hearth's Warming Dolls up on the mantel, just like we do every year. But this year, I put my doll too close to the edge, and it fell!"
Sandbar,[in slow motion] Nooooooo!
Ocellus,[gasps] And?!
Sandbar,My doll hit the floor. But it could have gone in the fire!
Smolder,[sarcastic] That's a great story. And you told it really well.
Sandbar,Yeah. It was a Hearth's Warming miracle.
Rainbow Dash,"Next! Smolder, come with me. Yona, Twilight's waiting for you."
Ocellus,"The last two. So if neither one of them confesses, that means..."
Silverstream,We're never going home!
Ocellus,We'll be here forever!
Sandbar,Beyond forever.
Silverstream,But I can't miss the Three Days of Freedom Celebration!
Gallus,[sarcastic] How long does that last?
Silverstream,"It used to be only one day, but now to commemorate our escape from the Storm King, we're adding two more days of awesome! See?"
Gallus,There's a book?
Silverstream,Mm-hmm! Queen Novo had these made for the Mount Aris board of tourism to explain it all to guests!
Silverstream,"[voiceover] We'll spend the first night in Seaquestria, thanking the ocean for protecting us from the Storm King. Sea-dancing, whale-singing, shell-stringing... Lots of ""ing""'s."
Silverstream,"[voiceover] The second day will be on Mount Aris, with sky-dancing and a wind song in the Harmonizing Heights to celebrate the Storm King's defeat. Then the third day, everycreature will party together, on land and sea! Grandparents and parents and sisters, uncles, brothers, acquaintances, neighbors, and cousins. And at the end of the night, Queen Novo is gonna give out presents!"
Gallus,"Wait. Hold on. ""Cousins""? What are those?"
Ocellus,"Your aunts and uncles' children. You know, part of your family. Heh. Oh. You're teasing us again, right?"
Sandbar,I'm guessing neither one of you confessed.
Yona,[sighs] Headmare Twilight say wait here.
Silverstream,Maybe they're changing their minds about sending us home.
Smolder,Why would they? Face it. We're stuck here.
Ocellus,[sniffles] But-but-but I have to go home!
Silverstream,My mom makes the best kelp fritters.
Sandbar,How can you be so cool about this?
Smolder,We're mad. We just show it differently.
Sandbar,More like you don't show it at all.
Yona,What pony getting at?
Silverstream,Maybe it wasn't just one prankster. Maybe there were three of you. And you're trying to hide your guilt by not being upset!
Ocellus,It does make sense.
Gallus,"Guys, stop it."
Smolder,Or maybe whoever did it is only pretending to be upset to throw us off.
Ocellus,Me?! But I didn't!
Gallus,"Come on, let it go."
Sandbar,"Come on! Ocellus, you know you did it! Just fess up!"
Gallus,"I said, stop fighting! That's not what the holidays are about! No matter what you call them or how you celebrate! D-Do you know how lucky you all are? With your stories about sharing and-and kindness and getting together with everycreature that you care about?"
Ocellus,"But griffons do that too, don't they?"
Smolder,Some holiday about a moon?
Gallus,"[sighs] Blue Moon Festival. The one time of year when griffons are nice to each other. Well, as nice as we can be."
Gallus,[voiceover] Families get together to eat and then complain about the food and give each other presents they don't like and mostly just try not to yell at each other.
Silverstream,"Well, at least you get to be with your family."
Gallus,No... because I don't have a family.
Sandbar,[voiceover] What about Grampa Gruff?
Gallus,[voiceover] That's just his name. He's not anygriff's actual grandpa. I felt like I never had a place in Griffonstone.
Gallus,"Then I came here and, well, met all of you. So I don't want to go home for the break. And that's why... I did it!"
Yona,[gasps] Griffon mess up decorations?!
Gallus,Yeah. It was me. I put goo powder in the Fire of Friendship.
Sandbar,So it wasn't Ocellus?
Ocellus,Why would you ruin things for us?
Gallus,"I didn't plan to! I just figured if I made a mess, our teachers would make us stay to clean up. We'd be together a little longer."
Smolder,"Well, it worked, didn't it?"
Gallus,"Better than I thought. And when Headmare Twilight threatened to cancel winter break, that meant I would get to be with all of you through the entire holiday. That's why I didn't confess."
Sandbar,"So, why are you admitting this now?"
Gallus,"I hated seeing all you fighting and-and blaming each other. That's the opposite of what all your holidays mean. Except maybe yours, Smolder. I can't keep all of you from the happiness of your homes and families just because I feel bad. I'm sorry. Don't worry. You won't have to tell our teachers. I will."
Twilight Sparkle,You don't have to. We already know.
Rainbow Dash,We kinda guessed it was you. But we wanted to give you the chance to tell the truth.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm proud that you did, and I'm glad to see you've been paying attention in Professor Applejack's honesty classes. But you're still going to have to make amends and stay over break for extra friendship lessons by yourself."
Silverstream,I'll stay with him.
Ocellus,"Me, too!"
Yona,Yona stay also!
Sandbar,I'm staying!
Smolder,What? All right. I guess pony holidays can't be that bad.
Sandbar,Now you can finally know what it's like to spend Hearth's Warming with friends who care about you.
Rainbow Dash,"[whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Looks like they don't really need any extra lessons."
Twilight Sparkle,"Since you obviously know that Hearth's Warming is about coming together, I'd be honored if all of you would join my friends as guests at our holiday table."
Twilight Sparkle,After we finish cleaning up.
Sandbar,"Hey, this reminds me of another story! ""The Time I Almost Spilled Grape Juice on the White Couch""!"
Smolder,Does it have a depressing ending?
Ocellus,I'm not sure pony stories work that way.
Yona,Gallus want Yona braid feathers?
Gallus,Uhhh... pass.
Silverstream,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!
Star Swirl the Bearded,"[voiceover] Dear Twilight, it is difficult to express how grateful I am to you for teaching me the power of friendship."
Star Swirl the Bearded,"[voiceover] You would think after more than a thousand years, there would be nothing left to learn."
Star Swirl the Bearded,"[voiceover] And yet, even a pony as old as I can continue to be surprised by how much there is to know."
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""I hope you find these postcards enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing you again, though I can't say when my journey will be complete. Your friend, Star Swirl."
Rarity,It must be gratifying to have your idol writing to you about the friendship lessons he's learning.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm not sure I'll ever get used to it. Of course, if he really wants to learn about friendship, he could just come to our school."
Cozy Glow,"Professor Sparkle? The mailpony just came with, uh, a few things."
Rarity,Ooh! The sewing machines I ordered for my class!
Cozy Glow,"These came, too. I wasn't sure what to make of them."
Rarity,"These machines were costly, but I am quite certain the friendship lessons I can teach my students with them will be invaluable."
Rarity,"Oh, don't worry, darling. I'll think of something. And I didn't use the school funds to buy these. I made the purchase entirely with my own bits."
Twilight Sparkle,It's not that. It's this!
Rarity,"[reading] ""Why waste your time at a friendship school that's just a school? Learn everything they teach and more at Friendship University""?!"
Twilight Sparkle,Who would open another friendship school?
Rarity,"Oh, pfft! I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. You're the Princess of Friendship. What could this other school possibly offer?"
Smolder,It isn't just another friendship school. It's a university!
Ocellus,It says they teach the same lessons of competing schools in half the time. That's twice the learning!
Gallus,And it's in Las Pegasus? If Professor Rarity lets us skip her sewing class <U+0096> road trip!
Rarity,I think we need to look into this school.
Rarity,I don't like to judge solely on appearances. But... what kind of friendship school is this?
Student 1,Only the best friendship school in the west... and maybe all of Equestria!
Twilight Sparkle,There's more ponies in here than at our whole school. Who is running this place?
Flim,"[echoing] Welcome, friends! You are about to embark on a journey of amazing magnitude! One that will change your lives forever!"
Flam,[echoing] Prepare yourselves to embrace a new path and become students of...
Flim and Flam,Friendship U!
Twilight Sparkle,Flim and Flam. Of course.
Flim,If you're alone and you can't make friends We understand your plight
Flam,"Until now, there was just one way Your friendships could take flight"
Flim,"There is a school real far away That'll teach you what to know But if you live here, you couldn't stay"
Flam,You'd learn you have to go-o-o-o
Ponies,Awww...
Flim,"Now, there is an alternative to all of that adversity"
Flam,"Not just a school, I'll have you know"
Flim and Flam,But a whole university
Others,"At Friendship U, our aim is true In a city, not some backwater You'll learn the things you need to know At our new alma mater"
Flim,"That's it, everypony, you heard correct!"
Flam,"Friendship U, the one and only university of friendship!"
Flim,"As you can see, we're a success By any kind of stat"
Twilight Sparkle,"That may be so, for all I know But I still smell a rat"
Flam,"Everypony, lookie here That other school's headmare"
Flim,Her presence is a testament To the mutual respect...
Flim and Flam,...we sha-a-a-are
Twilight Sparkle,"What?! No, it isn't!"
Flam,It really is the final piece To make our work complete
Flim,To have the Friendship Princess Bless our school is such a treat
Flam,We're so honored!
Flim and Flam,"At Friendship U, we teach to you (and you!) All of our friendship knowledge You'll learn it all in half the time At the one and only friendship college"
Twilight Sparkle,How can anypony learn friendship in half the time?
Flam,"Our coursework is so accelerated, to take longer would be a crime!"
Flim,The lessons that we teach have been Reviewed and checked and edited
Flam,Which might explain why our new school's
Flim and Flam,About to be accredited
Others,"At Friendship U, oh, yes, it's true Even the Princess of Friendship agrees The only place in Equestria To give out friendship degrees Yeah!"
Ponies,Friendship U! Friendship U! Friendship U!
Flim,"That's it, everypony! Let's hear it! Tell us again why it's the best!"
All,It's the only university of Friendship U!
Flim and Flam,Yeah!
Twilight Sparkle,Accredited?
Flam,It means officially recognized or authorized.
Rarity,We know what it means. But who would accredit this place?
Chancellor Neighsay,"Why, the EEA, of course."
Twilight Sparkle,Chancellor Neighsay?!
Chancellor Neighsay,The Equestria Educational Association has taken an interest in institutions that teach friendship in a pony-first environment. Surely you didn't think your school has a monopoly on the concept?
Rarity,"Well, she did write the book on it."
Chancellor Neighsay,"Ah, yes. How to teach friendship to creatures who will one day use it as a weapon against us."
Twilight Sparkle,How could they use friendship as a weapon?!
Chancellor Neighsay,"You tell me. It's your book. Meantime, this university appears to be a promising option for ponies who'd prefer to stick to the EEA book on the subject."
Twilight Sparkle,You can't be serious. They're obviously up to something. It's Flim and Flam!
Flim,"[gasps] Well, that certainly wasn't friendly."
Chancellor Neighsay,One would think the headmare of a school of friendship <U+0096> albeit an unaccredited one <U+0096> would behave differently. Unless she was trying to undermine the competition? Hmm?
Twilight Sparkle,I<U+0097> No! What?! I-I am not!
Audience Pony,I did think the Princess of Friendship would be friendlier.
Flam,"Now, now, fillies and gentlecolts. Let's show the princess just how friendly we are by signing up for some classes!"
Flim,Why don't I show you around?
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sorry, but approval from the EEA won't convince me that this school is what you promise."
Flim,And what would it take to convince you?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, somepony whose opinion I respect, for one."
Flim,Really? Somepony like... this?
Star Swirl the Bearded,Twilight?
Rarity,Uh-oh.
Twilight Sparkle,Star Swirl? What are you doing here?
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Why, studying friendship at Flim and Flam's wonderful school!"
Rarity,"Oh, please. I think I know a disguise when I see one. Take off that ridiculous beard... Flam!"
Flam,How's it going in here?
Star Swirl the Bearded,[groans] It-It's really me.
Chancellor Neighsay,"I'd heard rumors you've returned, but I didn't believe it until now. And if a pony of your stature is studying here, there really isn't anything else I need to see. I, Chancellor Neighsay, hereby confer upon Friendship University complete and unreserved EEA accreditation!"
Twilight Sparkle,I... I don't understand. Why would you come here and not my school?
Star Swirl the Bearded,"My travels brought me to Las Pegasus. I didn't come for the school, but Flim and Flam convinced me to try it out."
Twilight Sparkle,You can't trust Flim and Flam! They tried to con the Apples out of their farm! They sold fake health tonic! They run a resort in Las Pegasus!
Flam,"Technically, our resort is a legitimate business."
Star Swirl the Bearded,"I spent a thousand years thinking the worst of a ""bad"" pony. You taught me to look for the best in him. Whatever Flim and Flam's past may be, starting this school shows they want to change for the better."
Twilight Sparkle,I wish I could believe that.
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Besides, what's untrustworthy about opening a school of friendship? They don't even charge for classes."
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't know. But I know they're up to something. And until I find out, I'm begging you, come to my school instead."
Chancellor Neighsay,"I understand feeling threatened by competition, but my word, Princess. I wonder if the ill manners of the creatures at your school aren't contagious. I think I will take my leave before I become infected."
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Twilight, I promise I'll visit your school soon. But for now, perhaps it's best if you return there."
Twilight Sparkle,"You don't think they're running an actual friendship school, do you?"
Rarity,"Darling, of course not. Which is why we have to investigate!"
Twilight Sparkle,"But we can't go poking around the school. Everypony'll think I'm still just ""threatened by the competition""."
Rarity,Only if we do it as ourselves.
Rarity,"In these disguises, we could pass as students at out own school."
Twilight Sparkle,"[muffled] I don't know, Rarity."
Rarity,Ah-ah. What did I say about using our real names?
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, ""Plainity"". But I'm pretty sure this isn't enough of a disguise."
Student 1,"Hey, strangers! Are you two new here?"
Rarity,[blows bubblegum] We sure are. Completely new.
Student 1,Great! See ya in class!
Rarity,"[squeals] Now, I've read enough Shadow Spade to know the key to going undercover is rehearsing your backstory. [clears threat, in affected voice] I'm ""Plainity"". and I love bland old normal stuff. No frills for me. [normal voice] Okay! Your turn."
Twilight Sparkle,[groans] My name's Eyepatch. I have an eye patch.
Rarity,"Perfect! Now, how do we start our investigation?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I think we should split up. You enroll in some classes and find out what they're actually teaching. I'll look around and see what I can find, assuming I'm not recognized."
Flam,"Welcome, newest students! Let's dive right in, shall we? One of the most important elements of friendship is being thoughtful. True or false?"
Rarity,"If by ""thoughtful"" you mean ""generous"", I'd say true."
Flam,"Correct! [laughs] It was a trick question. Very impressive, Miss...?"
Rarity,Plainity.
Flam,"Well, well, well, Miss Plainity, keep it up and you'll be ready for our next level in no time!"
Flam,"Now, let's see if you can demonstrate for the class. What's something generous you could do for... me right now?"
Flam,"Class, Plainity here is now my star pupil. If any of you want a chance at studying with Star Swirl, I'd take notes on her every action."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hello? The door is open, so I'll just assume it's okay to come in and look around. Unless somepony says it's not. All right, then."
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""The Element of Laughter and its applications."" Okay, that seems pretty genuine. ""When to support your friends' decisions and when to talk sense."" Huh. That's actually kind of interesting. Aha! ""Friendship University's true goal... is to help friends become better friends""? [groans] Where is the proof that it's all a scam?"
Flam,There isn't any!
Flim,Twilight Sparkle! Did you really think an eye patch was enough of a disguise?
Twilight Sparkle,"No, I didn't!"
Flam,"Well, then we agree that everypony will recognize the Princess of Friendship in this photo of you sneaking into our office."
Flim,"I can see the headline now! ""Princess of Jealousy! Twilight Sparkle Bent on Ruining Her Competition!"""
Flam,So sad. A news story like that would destroy your reputation. Nopony will want to go to your school after that.
Flam,Just wait until the papers get a hold of this!
Flim,"""Princess Unhinged!"" It'll be the talk of Equestria!"
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Well, gentleponies, I've finished another stack. The lessons in these worksheets are quite fascinating. Twilight? What's going on here?"
Flim,"Oh, just your prot<e9>g<e9> getting caught snooping in our office in disguise! Well, sort of."
Flam,"Oh, honestly, Princess Twilight, envy does not look good on you."
Twilight Sparkle,I'm not envious! I know these two are up to something. I'm just trying to find out what.
Star Swirl the Bearded,"The only pony I see who is up to something is the pony in this picture, and it is not the princess I know."
Flim,"Well, it's about to be the princess all of Equestria knows."
Flam,"Unless... you decided to drop the whole ""uncover the scam"" thing."
Flim,Then we'll rip this silly picture up and not let it completely and utterly ruin you and your school.
Rarity,"You can be generous with all sorts of things. Gifts, compliments, your time."
Rarity,"Hey, Eyepatch! Where's your eye patch? [gasps] Was your cover blown?"
Twilight Sparkle,You could say that. Flim and Flam took a picture of me sneaking into their office.
Rarity,Were we wearing our eye patch?
Twilight Sparkle,"If I don't stop investigating, they're going to tell everypony that I'm trying to sabotage their school because I'm jealous."
Rarity,But-But-But that's ridiculous!
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know. Maybe I am just upset that Star Swirl came here instead of my school. Flim and Flam may have turned over a new leaf. We should probably just go home.
Rarity,"Twilight, you are not the kind of pony to let your emotions cloud your judgment. If you think Flim and Flam are up to no good, you can't give up, even if their lessons really are impressive."
Twilight Sparkle,"Wait, what?!"
Twilight Sparkle,Flim and Flam are charging for these?
Rarity,"Well, they have to cover expenses, and Flam insists that everything extra goes to improving the school and<U+0097>"
Rarity,"This is the scam, isn't it?"
Twilight Sparkle,Let's find out.
Star Swirl the Bearded,These lessons are so valuable. Are you sure I can't give you more?
Flam,"Ah-ah-ah! Unnecessary! Being able to share them with a pony like you is our real reward. [to Destitute Pony] Oh, my. And you want to study alongside Star Swirl, hmm?"
Destitute Pony,It's all I have.
Flim,Come back for the rest when you can afford it.
Destitute Pony,W-Wait! I'll sell the shirt off my back!
Flam,"And that's the kind of determination that'll get you to the next level, student whose... name I know!"
Rarity,"[whispering] Twilight, maybe I should take over the investigation. Think of your reputation!"
Twilight Sparkle,"My reputation isn't worth much if I won't risk it for what I think is right. Besides, I have a plan."
Flim,"Well, brother of mine, we've got almost all the bits we need to expand our resort. If we add another level of classes and worksheets, we'll be there."
Flam,"Maybe we should add two levels, just to be safe."
Flim,[sighs] It's a thing of beauty. But I was thinking. What if we added another extreme pool slide here?
Flam,"Mmmm... Sure, as long as the pipes for the musical chocolate fountain go through... here."
Twilight Sparkle,But shouldn't it go closer to the pudding hot tub here?
Flim,"Fair point, but<U+0097> What?!"
Twilight Sparkle,I knew your school was a scam!
Flim,"Well, well, well, if it isn't the Princess of Jealousy. I guess we'll be going to the papers after all."
Twilight Sparkle,And I suppose I'll just lead your students into this secret room of bits and resort expansion plans!
Flam,Uhhhh... l-let's not get hasty. You have something on us. We have something on you. Let's just call it even.
Twilight Sparkle,"I don't think so. You can destroy my reputation if you want, but using your students' bits to expand your resort is wrong, even if the lessons you teach are good ones."
Flam,Of course they're good. We copied them from your book.
Flim,"We just skipped every other page. All the lessons, half the time!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[groans] Fine. If you really want to call it even, give back the bits and stop charging for my lessons. Then you can teach them as much as you like."
Flim and Flam,Nah!
Flim,"Running a school is more work than we thought. Besides, we almost have everything we need."
Rarity,I think not!
Flam,Plainity? My star pupil?
Rarity,"[affected voice] Not Plainity, but... [normal voice] Rarity!"
Flim,Who?
Rarity,We decided to bring somepony else here to listen to everything you just said!
Flim,"[stutters] Hey, Star Swirl. We were just about to<U+0097>"
Star Swirl the Bearded,Return the bits you've collected from your students and close your school?
Flam,[gulps] Yeah. That.
Star Swirl the Bearded,"[sighs] It seems I'll never stop learning from your example, Twilight. It is a valuable lesson to stand up for what you know is true. I wish I had known it, too."
Student 4,Thanks for returning our bits. But how are we going to learn about friendship now?
Star Swirl the Bearded,"Well, I can refer you to a fairly reputable establishment just outside of Ponyville. I'm quite certain the headmare would consider letting you in."
Twilight Sparkle,"[reading] ""Of course, if I ever go to a school again, I'll make sure it's yours. In friendship, Star Swirl."""
Rarity,I still don't understand how Flim and Flam could have gotten a copy of your book.
Cozy Glow,"Uh, I finished straightening up in the library. Professor Rarity, I just wanted to make sure you're definitely keeping these."
Rarity,"But of course, darling. If there's one thing I learned at Friendship University, it is not to give up when you know what's right. And I know teaching friendship through sewing is right! I just need to figure out how."
Starlight Glimmer,Oh! Rarity! Just the pony I'm looking for! Can you come to Twilight's class with me? It won't take long.
Rarity,"Oh, I'd love to help, but I have to meet Rainbow Dash for our day of fun together."
Starlight Glimmer,Twilight wants to use you as an example for the students.
Rarity,Ooh!
Rarity,Your example is here! [laughs] Oh!
Rainbow Dash,I thought I was the example.
Twilight Sparkle,"You both are. Because together, you perfectly demonstrate my lesson on compromise in friendship. Rainbow Dash and Rarity have very different interests that keep them busy. But being friends is so important to them, they always manage to make time for each other."
Rarity,"[laughs nervously] Our day of fun was hard to plan, what with Rainbow Dash's extremely time-consuming and erratically scheduled Wonderbolts practice."
Rainbow Dash,"And Rarity's weird fashion seasons. She's working on her winter collection, and it's not even summer yet!"
Twilight Sparkle,"But you still found time to be together, and that's what counts. See, class? These ponies are models of true friendship in action."
Twilight Sparkle,Thanks for stopping by! Enjoy your day of fun!
Silverstream,Ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! What amazing stuff are you gonna do together?!
Rainbow Dash,"Aw, come on! I even said ""shopping"" that time!"
Rarity,Perfect! We'll go shopping first.
Rainbow Dash,But I brought stuff for buckball to<U+0097>
Smolder,Are we supposed to be learning something here? 'Cause this doesn't sound like compromising at all.
Gallus,"Yeah, you guys have nothing in common. How can you be friends?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Even though Rainbow Dash and Rarity enjoy doing different things, there are plenty of reasons why they're friends."
Yona,"Uh, like what?"
Rainbow Dash,[scoffs] We've always been friends.
Ocellus,Always?
Rainbow Dash,"Well, no. Not always. But for like a super long time."
Rarity,And we know all the same ponies.
Smolder,"Um, is that it?"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, there was that time during the Cloudsdale Best Young Flyer Competition that I totally saved Rarity's life."
Rarity,Yes! And I once proved Rainbow Dash's innocence to her beloved Wonderbolts when she was being framed for a mysterious incident.
Sandbar,Cool! What else?
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, look. It may seem like Rarity and Rainbow Dash don't have that much in common when you try to put it into words, but sometimes friendships can't be explained. You just have to see them in action to understand."
Twilight Sparkle,"Actually, that's a great idea!"
Twilight Sparkle,Just go about your day of fun as you normally would. You won't even know we're here!
Rainbow Dash,[singsongy] Game on!
Rainbow Dash,Rarity! You were supposed to be holding your bucket!
Rainbow Dash,"Good! 'Cause this time, I'm gonna try something new and super-intense!"
Rainbow Dash,Rarity! Are you even paying attention?!
Rarity,"What? Oh! I mean, of course! Uh, I held my bucket and everything!"
Rainbow Dash,But you have to catch the ball!
Rarity,"Really? Well, that sounds dangerous."
Rainbow Dash,"[quietly, to herself] Oh, forget it. She's never gonna understand the point of this game. [out loud] Buckball time is over!"
Rarity,[sighs] Finally!
Twilight Sparkle,"Uhhh, see? They did something Rainbow Dash likes, so now it's time for something Rarity likes. Compromise!"
Rarity,Hmmm... I'm genuinely not sure. Are they too in style?
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, isn't that what you want them to be?"
Rarity,"Oh, yes, yes. But they should be ahead of the curve. If they're in fashion right now, then they're practically already out."
Rainbow Dash,That doesn't make any sense.
Rarity,Hmmm... Perhaps I should get the stilettos instead. What do you think?
Rainbow Dash,"[scoffs] Unless you like tripping with every step, heels on a horse are pretty useless."
Rarity,"[nickers] Au contraire. They're perfect in a multitude of situations. Formal functions, afternoon teas, evening teas, high tea, tea by the sea, royal tea<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,Can they clean up glitter? Ew! It's on my hooves! Are we done yet?! [groans] This is sooooo boring!
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash and Rarity are just, uh, showcasing an aspect of friendship called ""banter"", the playful and friendly exchange of remarks. [laughs nervously] It's all in good fun."
Rarity,"Ooh, I cannot wait! Collecting gemstones is my favorite!"
Rainbow Dash,"Finally, something we can agree on! Treasure hunting!"
Twilight Sparkle,"See, everycreature? That didn't take long. Now they're having a great time together."
Rarity,Ooh! Magnifique! This will be perfect for the emerald-encrusted romper I've been working on!
Rainbow Dash,"Cool! Now, what would be even cooler is if we could find a treasure chamber or something! Now, if I were a secret door, where would I be?"
Rarity,"Ugh, Rainbow Dash! Could you please refrain from all of that racket? It's muddying my concentration."
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps] Look! A lever! [grunts] It's stuck! Come help me, Rarity!"
Rarity,[sighs] Just a moment.
Rarity,[gasps] You ruined my gems!
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, well, you ruined my treasure hunt!"
Rarity,Ugh! This wasn't about treasure! It was about finding gemstones for my winter collection!
Rainbow Dash,Who cares about clothes?! We're supposed to be on an adventure together!
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-oh.
Rarity,"That... is... it! This ""day of fun"" is officially over!"
Rainbow Dash,Fine by me! Maybe I can spend some time doing something I actually like now!
Twilight Sparkle,"[laughs nervously] Surely, you don't mean that. You're just having a little disagreement. [to students] Sometimes that happens between pals. But no matter what, they can always get past the problem and stay good friends."
Rainbow Dash,I don't think we can. [to Rarity] You don't care about any of the things I like! It's always about you and your boring fashions!
Rarity,"Oh, puh-lease! You don't even give my interests a chance! You have absolutely no respect for the finer things! No respect, I tell you!"
Rarity,"...And then there was the time Rainbow Dash called my Cloudsdale Couture Boutique idea ""impractical""! Imagine that! Just because I needed Twilight to perform the butterfly wing spell on me whenever I wanted to deliver merchandise!"
Rainbow Dash,...And I told her a thousand times Pegasi don't even want restrictive heavy dresses! We need to be able to fly! Duh!
Rarity,"Not to mention the day I was wearing a really gorgeous hat, and Rainbow Dash didn't even notice!"
Rainbow Dash,The Wonderbolts show was ruined! Rarity's hat was blocking everypony's view!
Starlight Glimmer,"Enough! Guidance counseling is for talking out your problems, not telling me everything that's ever happened in the history of Equestria! [groans] But I've learned sometimes talking isn't enough. You need to put yourselves in one another's shoes."
Rainbow Dash,No way am I wearing those!
Starlight Glimmer,[groans] What I'm saying is we need a way to help you two reconnect. Follow me!
Rainbow Dash,The library? And this helps us how?
Starlight Glimmer,"You both love books. Rainbow Dash never stops talking about Daring Do adventures, and you're a huge fan of Shadow Spade mysteries."
Rarity,Your point?
Starlight Glimmer,"The perfect way for you two to reconnect as friends is to read each other's favorite book. I'll read them, too. Then we'll all discuss afterward. It'll be a ""Good Friends Book Club"". Okay? I'll bring snacks."
Rainbow Dash,Ugh! Fine!
Rarity,If you insist.
Starlight Glimmer,"Great! We're all here! To start, why don't you two share one thing you liked about each other's books?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Okay. I'll go first. Uh, I really enjoy the part in Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams when Daring used a vicious cragadile as a raft, and then<U+0097>"
Rarity,[giggles] Please.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, what's so funny?"
Rarity,"Oh, sorry. It's just that I find those action sequences so ridiculously over-the-top."
Rainbow Dash,But they're real! You even met Daring Do!
Rarity,"Yes, but the book's descriptions just drag on, and what about those silly unpronounceable names? Doctor whozit-whatsit... [Spanish pronunciation] Caballeron?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, tea, anypony? Cucumber sandwich? [laughs nervously] Or we could go over some nice friendly talking points."
Rainbow Dash,[scoffs] Seriously?! Don't even get me started on those clothing descriptions in Shadow Spade! What a yawn fest!
Rarity,[stutters] But... the outfit descriptions are an integral part of the plot of The Colt in Crimson: A Shadow Spade Mystery!
Rarity,"You see, if you didn't know that Sir Fluffingsworth von Radishfield wears only silk, double-breasted waistcoats, you'd never deduce that he, in fact, was the culprit!"
Rainbow Dash,W-Wait. He was?
Rarity,[gasps] You didn't even read it!
Starlight Glimmer,"[quietly, to herself] I can see I'm gonna need reinforcements."
Rainbow Dash,Not my fault it's so boring and put me to sleep!
Rarity,"If you can't be bothered to read the thing I like, that just further illustrates the point that we have nothing in common anymore!"
Rainbow Dash,"At least we agree on that! From now on, I'm only hanging out with ponies who get me!"
Starlight Glimmer,Your drama can wait! Twilight needs help! Now!
Starlight Glimmer,[panting] Any luck?
Twilight Sparkle,No! It's goooone!
Rainbow Dash,What's gone?
Twilight Sparkle,The Amulet of Aurora!
Rarity,[gasps] One of the magical items you've been keeping for Princess Celestia?
Twilight Sparkle,"That amulet can reverse the tides and summon tsunamis! If it falls into the wrong hooves, Equestria will be in grave danger!"
Rainbow Dash,"Don't worry, Twilight! I know tons about searching for lost treasure!"
Rarity,"And if I follow the culprit's clues, I'm certain I can find who took your amulet!"
Twilight Sparkle,Thank you! I'll feel so much better knowing you two are looking for it together!
Starlight Glimmer,While we work on a locator spell. It's the perfect solution!
Rarity,"There appear to be no signs of damage to the surrounding artifacts, suggesting the thief did not leave in a hurry."
Rainbow Dash,"Rarity, your boots are leaving sparkles all over the floor!"
Rarity,"Pfft! Those aren't from my boots. Mine are magenta, not blue. See?"
Rarity,"I mean, really!"
Rarity,"[panting] Turns out these boots were not ""made for trotting,"" as advertised. Where are you going?! We promised Twilight we'd work together!"
Rainbow Dash,Don't you see? The Amulet of Aurora is made out of Azurantium!
Rainbow Dash,"Azurantium? You know! The same metal that the Amulet of Atonement from Daring Do book four is made from? It always leaves sparkles wherever it goes. Just like this, remember? It's from the book you just read!"
Rarity,[laughs nervously] That book! Yes! The one I-I just... just read! Ha-ha-ha!
Rainbow Dash,"Seriously?! After giving me all that grief, you didn't read mine either?!"
Rarity,Oopsie?
Rainbow Dash,"[groans] As soon as we find this amulet, we are done with each other!"
Rarity,Fine by me!
Rarity,"[panting] Ooh! Rainbow Dash, slow down! You're flying past important clues! Look, it's a print. But definitely not a hoof. Are those claw marks?"
Rainbow Dash,Who cares? I found a bigger clue!
Rarity,I hope you don't expect me to... [shudders] ...wade through that.
Rainbow Dash,Nah. It's too deep. We'll get stuck.
Rarity,Ooh. Clever. What Daring Do book did you get that from?
Rainbow Dash,"Actually, I learned it at Scootaloo's Filly Guides camp."
Rarity,[sighs] At least you can fly across.
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps, grunts] Nope. If one of those geysers burns off my wing feathers, I'll be out of the Wonderbolts for weeks. [groans] I could..."
Rainbow Dash,"...try and slingshot my way through. But I'd need two perfectly placed trees, some stretchy rope, and a pith helmet. [groans] Too bad we can't do what Daring Do did in book four and find a cragadile for a raft."
Rarity,"Ta-daaa! The S.S. Cragadile, at your service!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, that... is... awesome! Uh, I mean, it's all right, I guess."
Rainbow Dash,How did you know how to do that?
Rarity,"Mmm. We may have been friends for a super-long time, but you don't know everything about me yet."
Rarity,[gasps] The glitter trail! It's gone!
Rainbow Dash,How are we supposed to find the Amulet of Aurora now?
Bufogren,"[quietly] Owww. Ears. Why hoof-hoofs yell? Too, too loud."
Rarity,[loudly] Sorry! What did you say?!
Bufogren,"[quietly] Too, too loud."
Rainbow Dash,I think it's a Bufogren. They have really sensitive ears. [whispering loudly] Did you happen to see anycreature with a sparkly thingy go this way?
Bufogren,Saw it.
Rainbow Dash,"His breath smells so bad, I can't think! But we can't hear him from back here. Now what?"
Rarity,"Hmmm... [sniffs] Aha! I think I have the perfect solution. An old unicorn beauty trick. That is, if you can somehow procure us a tiny bit of cloud?"
Rainbow Dash,Now that I can do!
Rarity,"Ooh! It's adorable! [nose pinched] Um, excuse me, kind sir. I have a special treat for you in exchange for your information."
Bufogren,Ooh... What's that?
Bufogren,Owww!
Rarity,"Sorry, sorry. Enjoy."
Rarity,"[sniffs, sighs]  Good. Uh, now, which way did the sparkly thing go?"
Bufogren,Up-up. Up there.
Rarity,"Thank you! [to Rainbow Dash] Well, what are you waiting for? Go on! Fly up there and get that amulet!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, we're doing this together, remember?"
Rainbow Dash,"Sorry, but I wasn't leaving you behind in that swamp."
Rarity,[exhales] Thank you.
Rainbow Dash,Huh. Maybe the key to unlocking this thing is in these inscriptions.
Rarity,Or perhaps the key is right here!
Rarity,"I couldn't decide between the boots and the stilettos, so I got both!"
Rainbow Dash,High heels could do that?
Rarity,"And you called them ""useless""."
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I shouldn't have said that. Or made fun of the other stuff you like to do. Some of it's actually sorta neat.
Rarity,"I... owe you an apology, too. Buckball may not be my thing, but it's something you enjoy. And you're very good at it. I never should've treated your interests like they were worth less than mine."
Rainbow Dash,Soooo... does this mean we're still friends?
Rarity,I would very much like that. Now let's go find that amulet!
Rainbow Dash,Wait! That tunnel leads to the... school? A secret passage! Awesome!
Rarity,[gasps] Spikey-wikey! You stole the Amulet of Aurora?!
Twilight Sparkle,Not exactly.
Rarity,"You mean, this was a setup to make us get along?"
Starlight Glimmer,"Sorry to interfere, but you both..."
Rainbow Dash,...reeeeeally needed it.
Smolder,"So even though you don't like any of the same stuff, you two are friends again?"
Rarity,Heh. Always. I think we just needed a teensy reminder.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah. We don't have to love the exact same things to have fun together. I mean, imagine if we did! How boring would that be?"
Rarity,"When we give each other a chance to share the different things we enjoy, it can be surprisingly wonderful! [sighs] Too bad we wasted our day of fun."
Rainbow Dash,We still have a little time left. You wanna... go hit the shops? I could actually use your help picking out some new buckball gear.
Rarity,"Do I?! But only if you help me choose some buckball fan attire, so I can cheer for my favorite player at the drop of a fabulous hat!"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, yeah! Let's go already!"
Twilight Sparkle,[to students] See? Good friends always work through their differences.
Starlight Glimmer,[laughs] Even if it takes a little help.
Fluttershy,"Huh? [gasps] Some poor creature's in trouble! We have to help it! Oh, listen to that suffering! It must be in horrible agony!"
Fluttershy,Ooh! It sounds like a herd of injured chimerae! [pants] Or it's Cerberus with snifflitis in two of its heads and kennel cough in its third. Or maybe it's<U+0097>
Fluttershy,Pinkie Pie?
Fluttershy,"Ugh. At least no animal is suffering. Right, Angel?"
Fluttershy,"[laughs nervously] Well, until now."
Applejack,What is that thing?
Twilight Sparkle,"It's called a yovidaphone. It's from Yakyakistan, where it's actually quite popular."
Rainbow Dash,Is it supposed to sound like that?
Twilight Sparkle,"Not exactly. It's known to produce a fairly complicated, melodically rich, and harmonious tone."
Rainbow Dash,Are you sure we're talking about the same thing?
Pinkie Pie,[panting] Phew! And that's with only a few days of practice! Can you believe it?!
Rarity,"Yes. Yes, I can."
Applejack,I can honestly say I've never heard anything like it in my life.
Pinkie Pie,"Well, if you enjoyed listening to my playing half as I enjoyed playing my playing, then I should totally play more! That way, we'll be even!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I don't think that's necessary, Pinkie."
Rainbow Dash,Please. Don't.
Pinkie Pie,"There's a chance I may have missed a note or two here or there, but I just love playing so much! [sighs] You complete me."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I, for one, am glad you're having so much fun with your new hobby."
Pinkie Pie,[not listening] Uh-huh. Sure.
Twilight Sparkle,"And it's great that you're learning a new skill, and... and you're just waiting for me to finish talking so you can start playing again, aren't ya?"
Fluttershy,"[sighs, to Angel Bunny] It's okay. She's gone."
Applejack,Anypony else think that sounded like an apple core cut up in a pulp grinder?
Rarity,"Apple-solutely! Uh, absolutely."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, so maybe she isn't good yet. But she's our friend, and we should be supportive."
Applejack,She just started playin'. She's bound to get better. Right?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, we just need to be supportive of her practicing... [groans] So the getting-better part happens as fast as possible."
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] You're absolutely right, Spike. Sometimes it is nice to get out of the library and be in the sun."
Spike,Especially when you take the library with you.
Applejack,"[burbles, sighs] We need to do somethin' about Pinkie Pie's playin'!"
Rainbow Dash,"Like, now!"
Twilight Sparkle,Is it really that bad?
Rainbow Dash,Does this answer your question?
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, a trophy?"
Rainbow Dash,For second place. Second! Place! All because of Pinkie's playing!
Applejack,"And thanks to her fruit-blastin' melodies, I got an orchard full of nothin' but applesauce! And it ain't even saucin' season!"
Rarity,And just look what her playing did to poor Fluttershy!
Applejack,"I mean, I know we said we should all be supportive, but Pinkie's been playin' for moons now, and she's not gettin' any better."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! If anything, she's gotten worse!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, maybe we can just pretend she's really good, and then I'll find a spell that will<U+0097>"
Applejack,"Oh, no, no, no! We're not goin' through that again! Remember how well it worked out when you weren't honest with Celestia about her actin' ability?"
Twilight Sparkle,[groans] You're right. We'll just have to tell Pinkie Pie she's not very good at the yovidaphone.
Rarity,"Well, there's no time like the present."
Pinkie Pie,"Phew! Huh, that's weird. I coulda sworn this place was packed a second ago. Hey, guys! Can I favor you all with a tune? I take requests!"
Applejack,"Actually, we do have a request, and yeah, it involves your yovidaphone."
Pinkie Pie,"You mean the thing I love more than anything else in Equestria? My sun, my moon, my stars, my everything? Ooh! Tell me, tell me, tell me!"
Applejack,"All right. In all honesty... Uh, in all honesty... Rarity has somethin' to say!"
Rarity,"Pinkie, please listen to Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Dash,"Ugh, fine! So, Pinkie, remember when we all were shocked to discover Princess Celestia wasn't so good at acting?"
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, she was awful! But that's kind of a random thing to bring up. I thought you wanted to talk about my yovidaphone playing."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, it's, uh... It's just... You need to know, uh... Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"[sighs] Pinkie, we all support you, but we're afraid you're just not good at the yovidaphone, and none of us want you to waste your time on something you can't do well."
Pinkie Pie,Oh. [upbeat] Why didn't you just say so?
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] We were all really nervous to tell you.
Pinkie Pie,"Why? It's just a silly instrument. Well, lunch break's over. Gotta get back to the bakery. Those apple turnovers aren't gonna apple themselves! [whistles gleefully] No more yovidaphone playing for me-e-e!"
Fluttershy,Wow. She took that so much better than I thought.
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Another beautiful day in Ponyville.
Spike,"Uh, Twilight, when was the last time you saw Pinkie Pie?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hmmm, not since we told her to stop playing the yovidaphone. I'm still surprised with how well she took it."
Spike,I don't think she took it as well as you think she took it.
Daisy,Top of the morning to ya!
Pinkie Pie,Is it morning? I hadn't noticed.
Twilight Sparkle,That's not good.
Rainbow Dash,There you are! We've been looking all over for you!
Rarity,It turns out Pinkie may not have taken our critique of her yovidaphone playing in the spirit with which it was intended.
Twilight Sparkle,I saw.
Spike,There's gotta be something we can do.
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm sure there is, Spike. We just have to figure out what."
Rainbow Dash,[sighs] I don't get it. So she's no good at playing the yovidaphone. What's the big deal? There are so many other things she's really good at doing.
Applejack,Yeah! Not bein' able to play the yovidaphone is nothin' compared to all the things she can do well.
Twilight Sparkle,"And that's exactly what we'll show her! I bet if we get her to do the stuff she likes and is good at doing, she'll cheer right back up and forget all about the yovidaphone."
Applejack,Hoo-whee! That's a great idea!
Rarity,"Let's get started. Apparently, there's not a moment to lose."
Twilight Sparkle,"So, I'm guessing nopony had any success?"
Applejack,[sighs] My party cannon idea was a real dud.
Rainbow Dash,Don't blame yourself. None of us did any better.
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, not to worry. I came up with the perfect solution. Instead of trying to remind her what she's good at, we'll remind her what she's best at. And that's being our friend. We're gonna throw her a Pinkie Pie Appreciation Party!"
Fluttershy,"That's a wonderful idea! If anypony needs to know how much she's appreciated, it's Pinkie Pie."
Rainbow Dash,"We can get the whole town involved, just so she can see what a good friend she is to everypony."
Twilight Sparkle,Then I hereby officially declare today Pinkie Pie Appreciation Day!
Rarity,Now this is perfection!
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah! If anything could help Pinkie Pie cheer up and make her forget about her yovidaphone, this is definitely it!"
Applejack,"Sure is! Okay, who's gonna get her?"
Twilight Sparkle,"No need. Gummy's on it. In fact, there he is now!"
Applejack,"Uh, Gummy? You were supposed to bring Pinkie Pie. What happened?"
Rarity,Is she still coming?
Twilight Sparkle,"Fluttershy, can you understand what he's saying?"
Fluttershy,I could... if he was talking.
Spike,"Let me try something. [slowly, loudly, and deliberately] Gummy! Where is Pinkie Pie?!"
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe we should just go and get her.
Applejack,What in tarnation is goin' on here?!
Rarity,This decor is dreadful.
Rainbow Dash,And all of Pinkie's stuff is... gone?!
Rarity,It is a puzzle.
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Excuse me.
Rarity,"Oh, yes, of course."
Twilight Sparkle,"Um, Maud? Can I ask you a question?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You just did.
Applejack,"Well, can I ask you a question?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] You just did.
Rainbow Dash,[groans] Fine! How about if I ask you a<U+0097> Wait.
Rarity,"Oh, for goodness' sakes! Maud. All of your sister's things are gone. Explain."
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] No, they're not. They're right here."
Fluttershy,Have you seen Pinkie Pie?
Maud Pie,Lots of times. I grew up with her.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, let's try this a different way. Why did you pack up all of Pinkie's things?"
Maud Pie,[deadpan] She asked me to.
Rest of the Mane Six,What?!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Pinkie told me to pack up her room and take everything to the rock farm.
Rest of the Mane Six,What?!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] She said she wouldn't need them since she's moving to Yakyakistan.
Rest of the Mane Six,What?!
Rarity,"Terribly sorry, Maud. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said Pinkie's [chuckling] moved to Yakyakistan!"
Applejack,"Uh, Rarity? She did say that."
Rarity,"Uh, terribly sorry, Applejack. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said [chuckling] she did say that!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Maud, I don't understand. Why would Pinkie leave Ponyville?"
Rainbow Dash,Yeah! Why would she want to go live with the yaks?
Maud Pie,"[deadpan] She said without the yovidaphone, her life had no meaning, and at least in Yakyakistan, she could listen to the masters play. She hoped that would give her some semblance of happiness."
Rarity,"Well, no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! That will not do!"
Applejack,I say we go to Yakyakistan right now and make her come back home!
Twilight Sparkle,We can't just march up there and tell Pinkie what to do.
Fluttershy,[tearing up] But... we didn't even get a chance to say goodbye!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, we may not be able to go to Yakyakistan and force her to come home, but we could go say goodbye... and if we happen to mention how much her friendship means to us, and how much we'd miss her if she were gone forever, and then she decided to come back home on her own..."
Rainbow Dash,Then what are we waiting around here for?! Let's get going to Yakyakistan!
Twilight Sparkle,We're almost there.
Applejack,Pinkie's gotta be around here somewhere.
Fluttershy,But where?
Rarity,Is that...?
Twilight Sparkle,The music of the yovidaphone.
Rainbow Dash,Are you sure? Because that actually sounds kinda... good.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I'm sure. Come on."
Rainbow Dash,Huh. Not what I expected.
Yaks,Shhhh!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, sorry."
Yaks,Shhhhhhh!
Rainbow Dash,[hushed] I said I was sorry!
Fluttershy,"[hushed, gasps] There she is!"
Pinkie Pie,[gulps] [despondent] Gimme another.
Yak waiter,But pony already had twenty-five ice<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"I said, gimme another!"
Twilight Sparkle,[grunts] Pardon me!
Applejack,Excuse us.
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, uh, sorry!"
Pinkie Pie,[despondent] I feel nothing.
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe we can help with that.
Pinkie Pie,[despondent] Oh. Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Applejack,Just hear us out.
Rainbow Dash,We respect your decision to move to Yakyakistan.
Twilight Sparkle,"But we just wanted to remind you how much you mean to us, and how much we'd miss you if you decided to move here for<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,[despondent] Fine. I'll move back to Ponyville.
Rainbow Dash,Wow. That was a lot easier than I thought. We're awesome!
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, what's wrong?"
Pinkie Pie,[despondent] That's what's wrong. I thought coming here and listening to real yovidaphone playing would make me happy.
Pinkie Pie,[despondent] It makes me feel worse. I'm never gonna sound like that.
Yigrid,Yovidaphone fan pony watch instrument while Yigrid visit little yak's room?
Pinkie Pie,"[despondent] Eh. If I can't play it, I might as well do menial chores for those who can."
Applejack,"Okay, so Pinkie Pie is obviously still miserable."
Fluttershy,"Oh, I can't bear to see her like this."
Rarity,Indeed. But what else can we do?
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, we've tried everything!"
Fluttershy,Maybe not. Look!
Pinkie Pie,[stifled giggling] Whoops! Sorry!
Pinkie Pie,I forgot what an awful yovidaphoner I am.
Twilight Sparkle,Playing it makes you so happy.
Pinkie Pie,[wistfully] [sighs] It sure does. I mean... it did.
Twilight Sparkle,Then you should never stop.
Rarity,So say we all!
Applejack,Absolutely.
Pinkie Pie,But... you were the ones who told me to stop because I wasn't good.
Twilight Sparkle,And we were wrong.
Fluttershy,Playing makes you happy.
Rarity,"And as long as it makes you happy, it doesn't matter how good you are!"
Applejack,So get up there and show these yaks how it's done!
Pinkie Pie,"[stage whisper] I don't know if you've noticed, but the audience are all yaks, and they kind of have ""issues"" with things that aren't perfect! Like my playing!"
Rainbow Dash,"Pinkie Pie, you get up on that stage and play. If these yaks don't like it, they'll have to answer to us!"
Pinkie Pie,"Well, okay... If you all say so..."
Rainbow Dash,"[clears throat] Ladies and gentleyaks! Performing for her very first time here, let's give a big round of stomps for... Pinkie Pie!"
Pinkie Pie,"[clears throat] Um, hi! So, uh, any yaks here from out of town?"
Pinkie Pie,"Uhhh, I kinda wasn't expecting this."
Rainbow Dash,"Me, neither."
Yigrid,"[stomps] Oh, pony play good set!"
Pinkie Pie,You think so? Even though it wasn't perfect?
Yigrid,Yovidaphone is instrument of happiness. Playing yovidaphone make pony happy. Pony playing is perfect!
Pinkie Pie,"Well if that's the case, lemme play you the song I just wrote two seconds ago! It's called ""I've Got the Best Most Supportive Friends a Pony Could Ever Ask For""! [aside] It's a working title."
Twilight Sparkle,And a-one...
Applejack and Rarity,And a-two...
Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash,And a you-know-what-to-do!
Starlight Glimmer,"[dramatically] I don't know, folks. She's been in there a long time!"
Starlight Glimmer,Do you suppose the Terrifying Trunk Escape is too much for her?! What if the Great and Powerful Trixie can't<U+0097>?!
Trixie,Escape?!
Starlight Glimmer,"But if you're there, who's in here?"
Trixie,"Why, our volunteer, of course!"
Granny Smith,[coughs] Crabapple surprise! You shoulda oughta tell a pony before ya go a-poofin' 'em around the stage!
Twilight Sparkle,"Trixie, that was an amazing show!"
Princess Cadance,Flurry Heart and I loved it! I'm so glad we decided to come. You two have a real chemistry.
Trixie,The Terrifying Trunk Escape does require a grrrreat and powerful assistant.
Princess Cadance,"The way you two work together, it's like you've known each other as long as Twilight and I have."
Starlight Glimmer,It was pretty fun.
Twilight Sparkle,Of course it was! There's nothing better than a bond with another pony. You can share all kinds of things.
Starlight Glimmer,I think we'll stick to the stage magic for now.
Trixie,The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't chant.
Trixie,"[sighs] As much as I love my one-pony show, it's always nice to come to Ponyville and perform with my great and powerful assistant. Cadance is right. We do work well together!"
Starlight Glimmer,Doing a show with you is almost as much fun as counseling students at Twilight's school! [gasps] Which I'm supposed to be doing right now!
Starlight Glimmer,See ya later.
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' Excuse me, Ms. Powerful..."
Trixie,"[giggles] Usually, ponies just call me Trixie. But ""Ms. Powerful"" has a nice ring."
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' From here to Saddle Arabia, I have seen nothing that compares with your wondrous show. Uh, would you consider blessing my homeland with it?"
Trixie,I was just about to set out on tour. [grunts] But Saddle Arabia is much farther than my usual route. [grunts] Ugh!
Trixie,"[laughs] And, uh, my caravan might not be suited for an extended tour."
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' Mine is new and quite spacious. If it would help persuade you, I would happily trade it for yours."
Trixie,"Trade it?! Heavens, no! This is more than just some great and powerful wagon you see before you! It is shelter. It is transportation. It is my only friend on the long and lonely nights on the road."
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' Very well. Then I must see as many of your performances as I can. If I cannot convince you to bring your tour to Saddle Arabia, I must be prepared to relate its magnificence to your many fans there."
Trixie,"""Many fans"", you say? [laughs] Well, I suppose I could consider the trip."
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' Wonderful! I look forward to seeing you on the road! And if you change your mind about the caravans, my offer remains open."
Trixie,Hmmm...
Trixie,"It's just so far away. Of course, I love visiting new and exciting places. I am a traveling magician after all."
Starlight Glimmer,Hmmm. Sounds like your mind's made up.
Trixie,Not quite. The road is a lonely place. And this trip even more so. I was hoping I might convince my grrrrreat and powerful assistant to come along?
Starlight Glimmer,Really?
Trixie,Of course! You're not just my assistant and my counselor. You're also my friend. And what's better than a road trip with friends?
Starlight Glimmer,Nothing! This will be the best magical road trip ever!
Starlight Glimmer,I should probably get somepony to cover my student counseling duties while we're gone.
Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, are you all right?"
Trixie,"One caravan for two all set! Oh. You brought luggage. [nervous laugh] I mean, of course you brought luggage!"
Starlight Glimmer,"You bet I did! Everything two ponies need for the road trip of their lives! Three one-thousand-piece puzzles, one copy of Dragon Pit <U+0096> the best board game in the history of ponies <U+0096> my famous collection of campfire spices, and an inflatable raft. Did I forget something? I could pop back to the castle and grab it."
Trixie,"Oh, no. It isn't that."
Starlight Glimmer,"Yeah, maybe we don't need the raft."
Trixie,"[sighs] We just needed a little great and powerful rrrrreorganization! [struggling] Now, everything... fits.. just... fine!"
Trixie,[sighs] Who am I kidding? My wagon is too small for us. I understand if you're having second thoughts.
Starlight Glimmer,Second thoughts? [scoffs] Are you kidding? This wagon isn't small. It's... eh... cozy. And there's no such thing as too cozy.
Trixie,"Well, all right then! I guess it's time to hit the road! [struggling] I'll... start us off..."
Starlight Glimmer,[coughs] Okay. Maybe there is such a thing as too cozy.
Trixie,You're sure you wouldn't rather ride?
Starlight Glimmer,I'm sure.
Trixie,And you're not backing out? The two of us sleeping in that cozy caravan could get tricky.
Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, there's plenty of high-quality inns to stay at on the way. Don't worry about it. I'm not backing out of the greatest and most powerful road trip bonding experience two ponies could ever have."
Trixie,"Well, when you put it like that, I'm actually kind of excited!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Me, too! [sighs] Thank goodness we're not like Twilight or the others. They'd probably sing a song about it."
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,We're off on the road to friendship Our ride might be tiny and small
Starlight Glimmer,"Beats walking though, eh, Trix?"
Trxie,I am walking.
Trixie,"But road trips are a great way, we've been told, to get along"
Starlight Glimmer,"I'm glad we're sticking to it, we've already got a song"
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,"We're off on the road to friendship Side by side, just like peas in a pod"
Trixie,Our bond of friendship is stronger than this tour's demands
Hoo'Far,Hoo' My offer to trade caravans still stands!
Starlight Glimmer,"Wait, what did he say?"
Trixie,Nothing!
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,"We're so tight, we can't move around I guess we're stuck together 'cause we're friendship bound"
Trixie,"Sure is great traveling with you, buddy!"
Starlight Glimmer,"You too, buddy!"
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,We're off on the road to friendship
Trixie,"Yes, we are!"
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,We've each got the other to blame
Starlight Glimmer,Any trip can be exhausting if you make a fuss
Trixie,But we get on so well that's there no way that could be us
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,We're off on the road to friendship And there's nowhere that we'd rather be
Trixie,Was that off-key?
Starlight Glimmer,"In summer, winter, spring, and fall, we're friends throughout the year"
Trixie,"For untold seasons yet to come,  our friendship will be here"
Starlight Glimmer,"For nine, at least!"
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,"We're so tight, we can't move around"
Trixie,[quickly] Like a race where you tie your hooves together and you have to move in perfect synchronization to win!
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,We're friendship boooooound
Starlight Glimmer,[quickly] Or like a buddy movie where the two protagonists can't get away from each other because they're wearing hoof-cuffs!
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,We're friendship boooooound!
Trixie,"Ooh, the marketplace. Perfect! I've learned the hard way that life on the road requires very specific supplies. And we only have so many bits. So we'll have to spend them wise..."
Trixie,...ly.
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] Sorry about wasting bits on street food.
Trixie,"Oh, it's fine. Falafel bonding, right? [laughs] Besides, we still have enough for... haycakes and juice."
Starlight Glimmer,"Um, why don't we go there?"
Trixie,"Oh, no-no-no. I always buy my haycakes here."
Starlight Glimmer,"So we're just going to wait in line for hours? Uh, which is totally cool! Waiting-in-line bonding! Right?"
Trixie,"After our falafel purchase, we weren't able to get everything on my list. But we are definitely set for breakfast."
Starlight Glimmer,And I'm sure we'll find out that waiting in that super-long line was worth it.
Trixie,A few hiccups always happen. We'll be back on the road to friendship after a good night's sleep.
Mrs. Trotsworth,Mrs. We're all full!
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, I'm sure we'll find something."
Tall Pony,Nope.
Short Pony,Sorry.
Round Pony,All full!
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' Ah, the Glowpaz Festival. Somnambula is no doubt filled to the brim. Luckily, travelers such as ourselves have our caravans."
Trixie,"[laughs, to Starlight] You said there'd be plenty of places to stay. ""Don't even worry about it,"" you said. Ya might've thought to make a reservation!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Um, I've been with you singing and standing in line. When would I have done that?"
Trixie,I don't know. But I'm starting to think you aren't as great and powerful an assistant as I thought!
Starlight Glimmer,So you just brought me along to do your legwork?
Trixie,[sighs] No. Of course not. I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated. I was really looking forward to a relaxing night in a nice room.
Starlight Glimmer,"[sighs] Me, too. But since there's literally no room at the inns, I guess it's lucky we've got the wagon."
Starlight Glimmer,[unenthusiastically] Sleeping-in-tight-quarters bonding.
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,[unenthusiastically] Yaaaaay.
Trixie,Is there something I can do to make things more comfortable for you?
Starlight Glimmer,You could get rid of this junk.
Trixie,"Yes, well, before we throw away the magical items it's taken me years to collect, we could try switching hammocks."
Starlight Glimmer,Fine.
Trixie,[gasps] Hmm? [whispering] Starlight! Starlight! I think there's a wild animal outside!
Trixie,Starlight?
Trixie,Starlight!
Starlight Glimmer,[startled noises] What?
Trixie,"I'm sorry. Your snoring is a bit, um..."
Starlight Glimmer,"Loud? [nervous laugh] Yeah, I do that. I had my village convinced we were being attacked by bears every night."
Starlight Glimmer,"[laughs, clears throat] But we probably need a better solution here."
Trixie,[sleepily muttering] Ladies and gentleponies... Great and Powerful Trixie... amazing feats...
Starlight Glimmer,Seriously?!
Trixie,[sleepily muttering] Prepare to be amazed...
Trixie,[grumpily] Sleep well?
Starlight Glimmer,[grumpily] Sure did.
Trixie,"Is, uh, that the last of the haycakes?"
Starlight Glimmer,[chomps] Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
Trixie,It's fine.
Starlight Glimmer,I don't suppose there's any more juice.
Trixie,[glugs] Ahhh! Nah. I guess we'll have to resupply.
Hoo'Far,Hoo' What a glorious morning! I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to the first show of your tour!
Starlight Glimmer,Is he gonna be following us for the whole time?!
Trixie,I do not know.
Starlight Glimmer,[flatly] She's been in there a long time. Do you suppose the Terrifying Trunk Escape is too much for a pony who drinks all the juice and talks non-stop in her sleep?! What if the Great and Powerful Trixie can't...
Trixie,Sleep?! Because her roommate snores like an ursa major?!
Starlight Glimmer,"[flatly] But if you're there, who's in here?"
Others,"""Cortland"": There's not much room in here!"
Trixie,At least you don't have to sleep in it with another pony!
Hoo'Far,Hoo' [claps weakly] This show is much better in Ponyville.
Trixie,Oh. Would you like the last carrot? I know how fond you are of eating the last of things.
Starlight Glimmer,"Oh, no. It might make me thirsty, and we don't have anything to drink. So..."
Trixie,"The good news is I'm so exhausted, I could sleep through a stampede of wild boars! Which, you'll be delighted to know, is only slightly louder than your snoring."
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, I'm looking forward to rehearsing the act with you all night. So diligent of you to go over it and over it in your sleep."
Trixie,[through gritted teeth] Practice makes perfect.
Starlight Glimmer,"Not today, it didn't."
Trixie,"Well, I'm sorry you're so miserable!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Really?! Because if you wanted to make things more comfortable, you could always pare down a bit!"
Trixie,"Well, since you're so concerned about space, you can have it all! I'll sleep under the stars, where at least the wild animals will be QUIETER THAN YOU!"
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' I do not mean to interrupt, but it seems there is trouble on the road to friendship."
Starlight Glimmer,[derisive laugh] Ya think?!
Trixie,[gasps] Where's my wagon?!
Starlight Glimmer,I traded it to that pony from Saddle Arabia for his. He even threw in a pair of robes.
Trixie,You what?!
Starlight Glimmer,"I traded the old, worn-out wagon that was too small for us, for this nice spacious one that we can both enjoy."
Trixie,[stammering] Who said you could do that?!
Starlight Glimmer,"Nopony. I just did it. [sighs] Now we both have plenty of room, and you didn't even have to give anything away."
Trixie,Au contraire. I did give something away! I gave away my wagon... and my best friend!
Starlight Glimmer,Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't realize you were better friends with that beat-up old wagon than you are with me!
Trixie,"Well, it's easy when the wagon is a better friend! It would've never traded you away!"
Starlight Glimmer,That's ridiculous.
Trixie,"Oh, it is ridiculous. In fact, this whole tour is ridiculous! I don't even know why I invited you in the first place!"
Starlight Glimmer,"Well, maybe I should just head home!"
Trixie,I think that's a very good idea! And you can take this horrible giant caravan with you!
Starlight Glimmer,Fine!
Trixie,Good!
Trixie,[grunting] Come on! Whoa!
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' Goodness! Oh, Ms. Powerful. Eh, but where is your assistant? I had hoped providing you with a more comfortable means of conveyance would allow you to once more dazzle the crowds with mystifying feats of magic."
Trixie,"Normally, that sort of flattery would suffice. But today, we must discuss your dishonest and unfair procurement of my wagon!"
Hoo'Far,Hoo' I desired your wagon and provided one of equal and better value in return. It seems like a perfectly honest and fair trade to me.
Trixie,"Unfortunately, it is more nuanced than that!"
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' I'm sure it is, but I am eager to set out. If you'll excuse me."
Trixie,Ha! We'll just see about that!
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' You know, even if I was willing to reverse the trade, you don't have my caravan to offer in return."
Trixie,[grumbles] Details!
Starlight Glimmer,[struggling] You all seemed... a lot less threatening when there were two of us!
Starlight Glimmer,"[gasps, yells] This place is awful! How did I not see it before?!"
Others,"""Rainy Day"": Hey! It's one of those traveling ponies!"
Others,"""Snow Violet"": Your song really inspired us! We decided we need to head off on the road to friendship, too!"
Others,"""Rainy Day"": It sure beats the road to deliveries!"
Others,"""Snow Violet"": Yeah! Sometimes traveling together is hard!"
Others,"""Rainy Day"": You reminded us we could also make it fun! Thanks again! Woo-hoo!"
Hoo'Far,Hoo' Steaming hot beverage?
Trixie,Thank you. No.
Starlight Glimmer,What are you two doing?
Trixie,"Taking a stand! By lying down! Not that you care, Wagon-Trader-Away-er!"
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' I'm afraid I'm still not interested, despite your assistant's convenient appearance."
Starlight Glimmer,"Trixie, I came back to apologize. I should never have traded away the wagon. It wasn't mine to trade. It belongs to my friend."
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' Hmmm. If you truly were friends, I suppose I'd be honor-bound to reverse the trade."
Trixie,Okay! Fine! We're friends! Best friends who share a deep bond who weren't prepared for the emotional challenges of traveling. Happy?!
Hoo'Far,Hoo' I'm still unconvinced. Perhaps you could prove your friendship.
Trixie,How?
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, we could do our friendship chant!"
Trixie,"Oh, right... Our world-famous chant of friendship that we do all the time because we're such great friends."
Starlight Glimmer and Trixie,"[out of sync] Magic, tra-magic... poof of smoke... want to wave your hooves... and tell a... little joke!"
Hoo'Far,Hoo' [coughs] That was the worst friendship chant I have ever heard! And you two were clearly making it up as you went. But only true friends would be willing to act so ridiculous for one another.
Trixie,So you'll give back the wagon?
Hoo'Far,"Hoo' Though I'd suggest heading back to Ponyville. I'm not sure Saddle Arabia is ready for... uh, this."
Starlight Glimmer,That's fair.
Starlight Glimmer,I'm sorry your Saddle Arabian tour was ruined.
Trixie,"Honestly, I don't think I could've stood one more second on the road. At a certain point, I don't even like traveling with myself."
Starlight Glimmer,"It is a lot harder than I thought. Still, I'm glad we tried. Mostly so we know not to do it again."
Trixie,I think it's made our friendship greater and more powerful than ever!
Others,"""Cortland"": [grumbles] You know, there's actually plenty of room in here for one pony to nap. Is the show over?"
Scootaloo,"Order, order, everypony! I hereby call to order this meeting of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club!"
Scootaloo,First order of business <U+0096> [quickly] Let's-celebrate-the-one-and-only-Rainbow-Dash-yay-she's-amazing-now-if-there's-nothing-else-that-concludes-this-meeting-of-the-Rainbow-Dash-Fan-Club-thank-you-all-for-coming-any-questions?!
Rainbow Dash,Huh?
Scootaloo,Meeting adjourned!
Scootaloo,"I'd like to call to order the first ever meeting of the newest and most exciting club <U+0096> of which I am the president, founding, and only member <U+0096> the Washouts Fan Club!"
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, hey, Scootaloo. I was just in the neighbor<U+0097> Oh! What's this? Did I interrupt your fan club meeting?"
Scootaloo,Hey! What are you doin' here?
Rainbow Dash,I could ask you the same question!
Scootaloo,"Oh, uh, y'know... mmm... s-s-stuff. Uh, definitely not starting a new fan club or anything."
Rainbow Dash,"Ha! It's no use pretending! I heard everything when I was outside eavesdropping, like I do for every meeting!"
Scootaloo,You eavesdrop on every meeting? That's weird.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, sure it sounds weird when you say it out loud. And I probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is wrong, but still. Why are you starting a new fan club?"
Scootaloo,I just think maybe it's time for me to explore other fan clubs.
Rainbow Dash,"[gasps] What is a ""The Washouts""?"
Scootaloo,"Only the newest, and greatest, and only stunt troupe in Equestria!"
Rainbow Dash,Stunt troupe?
Rainbow Dash,"""Twenty bajillion""?!"
Scootaloo,They do all sorts of extreme stunts that focus on daredevilry and sheer guts rather than boring old flight and formation junk.
Rainbow Dash,"""Boring old flight and formation junk""?!"
Scootaloo,Are you just repeating everything I say?
Rainbow Dash,Only because my brain feels like it's strapped to one of those rockets about to explode.
Scootaloo,So you do get it! Aren't they awesome?!
Rainbow Dash,Can you believe she actually said that?!
Pinkie Pie,"Pfft, well, yeah! Eavesdropping on every meeting is kinda weird."
Rainbow Dash,"I mean, she basically said that the Wonderbolts aren't cool! And... And it kinda sounded like she didn't think I was cool either. But, peh, we all know that's crazy! I mean, I'm definitely not worried about her looking up to somepony else. Heh. Nope. Not! At! All!"
Applejack,"Well, I'd understand if you were. It'd be like if Apple Bloom started lovin' bananas more than apples. [laughs, sotto voce] Y'all tell me if that ever happens, ya hear?"
Rainbow Dash,But what could the Washouts possibly have that I don't?!
Pinkie Pie,Why don't you find out?
Rainbow Dash,They're doing a show in Ponyville this weekend?!
Twilight Sparkle,"Wow! They do look pretty amazing... uh, -ly unamazing. [nervous laugh] Trying so hard to look amazing is what I mean."
Scootaloo,Awww. I knew we shoulda lined up last night.
Rainbow Dash,Look at this! It's a total Wonderbolts ripoff!
Scootaloo,What do you mean? The show hasn't even started yet.
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, but look at what we're sitting on."
Rainbow Dash,"Hello?! The Wonderbolts have bleachers, too! We practically invented sitting on bleachers!"
Rarity,Ugh!
Rainbow Dash,And look at that! Popcorn and cotton candy?! Ripoff!
Scootaloo,Huh? Yeeeeeeeaaaahhh!
Announcer,This is the time! This is the place! This is the team! This is... the Washouts!
Pinkie Pie,Mmmm! Quality confetti cannon work.
Scootaloo,"Oh, yeah!"
Announcer,"Say it with me now, the Washouts' official motto..."
Announcer and Crowd,Leap before you look!
Scootaloo,Woo-hoo!
Rainbow Dash,Lame.
Fanpony,Oh!
Announcer,"Remember, ponies. While they're amazingly awesome, the Washouts are highly trained professionals in protective fire-proof flight suits! Do NOT try this at home!"
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa. Come on, come on! She's not gonna make it!"
Rainbow Dash,That... was... insane! Woo-hoo!
Scootaloo,I told you!
Rainbow Dash,I mean... [clears throat] It was pretty cool. Who are these guys?
Scootaloo,I can't just go up and talk to them.
Rainbow Dash,"You can if you're with me. After all, one of the reasons there's a Rainbow Dash fan club is because I'm fearless. Observe."
Rainbow Dash,Hey!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, so as a fellow aerobatic professional, I really enjoyed your show. Heh. Actually, you might recognize me since I'm a... pause for dramatic effect... a Wonderbolt."
Rolling Thunder,[Australian accent] Ha! Join the club.
Rainbow Dash,O... kay...
Rolling Thunder,"No. I mean, literally. Join the club. We're called ""The Washouts"" because we all used to be Wonderbolts just like you. Heh. Until we ""washed out""."
Rainbow Dash,No way!
Rolling Thunder,"Yep. [sighs] Name's Rolling Thunder. I got booted out of Wonderbolt Academy because of ""flagrant disregard for hazardous weather"". Pfft! If doing barrel rolls through nine hundred million volts of electricity in a raging thunderstorm is wrong, then I don't wanna be right."
Rainbow Dash,Cool!
Rolling Thunder,Ha. This 'ere's Short Fuse.
Short Fuse,"Ah, nice to meet you."
Rainbow Dash,What's your story?
Short Fuse,ANGER ISSUES! GET OFF MY BACK!
Rainbow Dash,"Uhhh... Okay. So, who's the leader?"
Rolling Thunder,Only the most reckless ex-Wonderbolt of all time.
Rainbow Dash,[gasps] Lightning Dust!
Lightning Dust,Rainbow Dash!
Scootaloo,Scootaloo. I'm Scootaloo. Hi.
Rainbow Dash,"Lightning Dust! I should've known you were the brains behind a crazy idea like the Washouts! Or should I say, ""lack of brains""!"
Scootaloo,"You two really know each other? Oh, my gosh! This is so cool!"
Lightning Dust,"Your ""friend"" got me kicked out of the Wonderbolts."
Scootaloo,"Oh. That's, uh, less cool."
Lightning Dust,"And it was the best thing that ever happened to me! Great to see you, wingpony! I heard you're a full-fledged Bolt now."
Rainbow Dash,"Yeah, well, I'm still<U+0097>"
Lightning Dust,"Mad at me? Look, was it wrong of me to endanger the lives of your friends? Yeah. But, hey, now I only endanger these knuckleheads."
Lightning Dust,"C'mon, you know you miss me. Me and her, we blew everypony out of the sky."
Scootaloo,Really?
Lightning Dust,"Actually, yeah, really! All that wind was totally dangerous, but we had fun, right? Two fastest times on the Dizzitron!"
Rainbow Dash,"If I remember correctly, I had you beat by half a second."
Lightning Dust,"Only because when I went, I cranked up the dizziness factor."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, I'm glad it all worked out. Your show was pretty dynamite."
Lightning Dust,[to Scootaloo] Wanna know the secret? We basically ignore everything the Wonderbolts ever taught us about safety.
Rainbow Dash,"Well, we do have safety rules for a reason."
Lightning Dust,"Don't listen to her, kid. All their ""rules"" were just ways of keeping their little club exclusive so they could feel good about themselves."
Rainbow Dash,It's not about making anypony feel bad. It's about finding the best flyers. The best of the best.
Lightning Dust,"I started the Washouts because I believe anypony can be the best of the best. You know, Rolling Thunder is gonna be out for a while."
Rolling Thunder,"Ah, during the finale, I caught the old hind leg in the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot! Patent pending."
Lightning Dust,There's a spot on the team if you wanna join up.
Rainbow Dash,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm already a Wonderbolt."
Scootaloo,I'll do it! Can I do it?!
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, lemme think. No!"
Scootaloo,[scoffs] I wasn't asking you!
Lightning Dust,"Awww, you're cute. But technically, you haven't washed out of the Bolts, which is kinda our thing."
Rainbow Dash,"And also, no!"
Scootaloo,"Oh, what if I joined and dropped out super quick?!"
Rainbow Dash,That's it! You're comin' with me!
Scootaloo,Where are we going?
Rainbow Dash,To hear what the actual Wonderbolts think about you joining just to drop out for the Washouts!
Lightning Dust,Say hi to Spitfire for me!
Rainbow Dash,Ever seen two simultaneous inverse displacement rolls before?
Scootaloo,"[scoffs] Would've been a lot cooler if you had the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot, patent pending."
Rainbow Dash,You... What?! [to Spitfire] See? This is what I was telling you about.
Spitfire,I got this. [to Scootaloo] You know what happens when something goes wrong with the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot?
Rainbow Dash,Patent pending?
Spitfire,You end up in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!
Scootaloo,But with enough practice<U+0097>
Spitfire,"Practice?! Well, la-dee-doodle-dah! Lemme give you a different scenario. You're probably saying to yourself, ""I'm young. I'm strong. I'm gonna go out there and stunt some tricks with my new friend Lightning Dust!"" Well, I'm here to tell ya that if ya play that game, you're gonna find out it's pretty hard to ""stunt tricks"" in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!"
Rainbow Dash,I think she gets the poi<U+0097>
Spitfire,"I'm not finished! Listen, I get it, kid. I used to be like you, tellin' myself, ""I'm gonna touch the sky!"""
Scootaloo,I don't<U+0097>
Spitfire,"Well, whoop-dee-doodle-doo! You think you got it made in the shade? Well, things are gonna be pretty shady indeed when you can't go out in the sun, 'cause you're in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw! Do I make myself clear?!"
Scootaloo,[shakily] Uh-huh...
Spitfire,Excellent. Have a hat.
Rainbow Dash,"Uh... Heh. Sorry that was a little... intense. I just wanna make sure you don't get hurt. That way, you can follow in my hoofsteps. Heh. Everypony's dream, right?"
Scootaloo,"More like ""follow your wingflaps""."
Rainbow Dash,Same difference.
Scootaloo,"[sarcastically] Thanks, super-talented flyer, for clearing up what I should do."
Rainbow Dash,"Clearing things up is one of my specialties. Now, come on. Let's go rip up all your Washout posters into tiny pieces and throw 'em off a cliff."
Rainbow Dash,"I just thought of a great way to raise awareness for your original fan club. You know, the one about me?"
Rainbow Dash,How about a silent auction where every item is just a picture of yours truly? [laughs] Nah! I'm just kidding.
Rainbow Dash,"That makes me seem too egotistical, doesn't it? Oh, oh! Maybe if they're framed, it's like, ""Wow, she's so humble!"" Ya think? Scootaloo?"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, Scootaloo?"
Rainbow Dash,Anypony seen Scootalo<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"Ow! My fault, my fault! Sorry, I<U+0097> Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,[groans] Sorry. I was just... um...
Rainbow Dash,Please tell me you got that stuff so you could rip it up and throw it off a cliff.
Twilight Sparkle,They were doing an autograph session before practice.
Rainbow Dash,"Seriously?! [groans] You haven't seen Scoot, have you?"
Twilight Sparkle,Actually...
Rainbow Dash,I can't believe Scootaloo ditched me to watch them practice! Why can't she see how dangerous they are?!
Twilight Sparkle,That's kind of the whole draw. It's exciting.
Rainbow Dash,"But it's like the harder I try to convince Scoot they're dangerous, the more she likes them!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You can't control her actions. Only yours. Teach her what's safe and what isn't, like a good role model. Then hope she makes the right decisions."
Rainbow Dash,But what if she chooses them over me? She's gonna get hurt!
Twilight Sparkle,I think I know somepony else who might get hurt if that happens.
Rainbow Dash,"Um, maybe you're right. But this isn't about me. I'm just worried about Scoot."
Short Fuse,"Wow. You're really workin' hard on this new stunt. [chomps, spits] What kind of sorry excuse for a tomato sandwich is this?!"
Lightning Dust,"Sorry, Dash. Autograph session's over. Unless you wanna buy Short Fuse's limited edition half-eaten tomato sandwich."
Short Fuse,I'm not signing that abomination!
Rainbow Dash,"You haven't seen Scootaloo, have you?"
Lightning Dust,"Ohhhh, isn't she that pony that used to respect you?"
Rainbow Dash,[growls] I'd appreciate you helping me find her so I could apologize for trying to make her quit liking you.
Lightning Dust,"[laughs] Oh, I'm pretty sure she still likes us."
Rainbow Dash,"Lightning Dust, I know we go way back, but I can't let her do this!"
Scootaloo,I don't need you standing up for me!
Rainbow Dash,"Obviously, you do! Because you can't see how dangerous this is! Do you not remember what Spitfire said?"
Lightning Dust,Ugh. Lemme guess. [imitating Spitfire] You'll be in a full-body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!
Rainbow Dash,That doesn't even sound like Spitfire.
Rainbow Dash,That's it! We're leaving!
Scootaloo,"Just because I look up to you doesn't mean I have to be you! But based on your definition of what makes somepony great, I have bad news. I'll never be the best of the best or a Wonderbolt! Because I! Can't! Fly! Is that what you wanted to hear? But not being able to fly doesn't mean I can't do something awesome! Like strapping my scooter to a multi-stage liquid-fueled rocket and jumping twenty-two wagons lined up in front of a roaring crowd!"
Twilight Sparkle,That was awfully specific.
Lightning Dust,That's 'cause it's what she'll be doing in the show tonight. Half off for princesses! [whispering] Bring your friends!
Twilight Sparkle,"Scootaloo, are you sure that's what you really wanna do?"
Scootaloo,Absolutely. [to Rainbow] And there's nothing you can do to stop me!
Rainbow Dash,"You're right. You're your own foal, and you have to make your own decisions."
Scootaloo,Good! Because I already have!
Applejack,Hoo-wee! Looks like all of Ponyville is here. Except for Rainbow Dash.
Announcer,"And here to introduce the most dangerous stunt we've ever performed, it's your fearless captain, L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Lightning Dust!"
Lightning Dust,"In just a moment, the newest member of the Washouts will be rocket-sledding down that hill, up that ramp, and over all twenty-two wagons to land on the other side in one piece! Heh. If she's lucky."
Lightning Dust,Put your hooves together for Half-Pint Dynamite!
Scootaloo,"Lightning Dust, I have to tell you. I actually started Equestria's first Washouts fan club! As far as I know. So this is a real honor, ma'am! Uh, do I call you ""ma'am""?"
Lightning Dust,"You land this jump, you can call me whatever you want."
Scootaloo,Wow. That sure is...
Lightning Dust,"Dangerous? Nah! Well, maybe a little."
Scootaloo,Has anypony tested it before?
Lightning Dust,Where's the fun in that?
Scootaloo,There's m-more?!
Lightning Dust,"You're not thinking of backing out, are you?"
Scootaloo,No! I'm just thinking about drinking through straws.
Lightning Dust,Are you the president of my fan club or not?
Scootaloo,Of course! It's just<U+0097>
Lightning Dust,"You wouldn't wanna get impeached for dishonoring my wishes, would you?"
Scootaloo,I... Is that a thing?
Lightning Dust,Light it up!
Scootaloo,Okay. Now I am thinking about backing out.
Lightning Dust,Too late!
Rainbow Dash,"I know I was supposed to let you make your own decisions, but that doesn't mean I can't swoop in and save you from time to time."
Lightning Dust,"If I'd known you were gonna bail, I would've done the trick myself!"
Rainbow Dash,Great! So you won't mind how that rope's about to coil around your hoof.
Lightning Dust,RIVALS FOR LIIIIIFE!
Rainbow Dash,Wouldn't have it any other way!
Scootaloo,"I'm sorry for joining the Washouts. Lightning Dust wasn't who I thought she was. She didn't care about me being scared or putting me in danger. She only wanted a good show, even if it meant I got hurt. That's not the kind of pony I wanna look up to."
Rainbow Dash,I'm the one who should be apologizing for not acting like somepony who deserves a fan club. I've been lucky enough to have somepony who thinks I'm the coolest. But there's nothing cool about making you feel like you'll never be as awesome as me. I think we should cancel the Washouts Fan Club. Because I know a fan club that could use some new members.
Scootaloo,The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!
Rainbow Dash,"[clears throat] Welcome to the first ever meeting of the newest fan club for the awesomest, previously under-appreciated pony in Ponyville! With founding member and president Rainbow Dash presiding, it's the... Scootaloo Fan Club!"
Scootaloo,"You know, Rainbow Dash was right. Eavesdropping on your own fan club isn't weird at all."
Rockhoof,"[grunting and laughing] You're going to have to work faster than that if you plan to dig up my whole village, lass. Let me help."
Professor Fossil,"Er... Thank you, Rockhoof, but we're trying to carefully preserve every bit of history here."
Rockhoof,Aye. This place is full of memories. Did I tell you about the time our chieftain knocked down five boulders with the kick of a wee ball?
Professor Fossil,[gasps] Stop that!
Rockhoof,But... [stutters] That's what this is for.
Professor Fossil,Maybe in the past. [blows] Now it belongs in a museum. Safe. Preserved. Untouched.
Rockhoof,Agh! Next you'll be sayin' I shouldn't have used the old sweat lodge.
Professor Fossil,"So, you see why Rockhoof isn't an ideal fit for my team. Perhaps you could use his, uh... unusual talents?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Of course, Professor Fossil! We'd be honored to have a Pillar of Equestria on our staff!"
Professor Fossil,"Oh, thank Celestia."
Rockhoof,"[slurps, crunch] Ugh! [spits, groans] That apple's made of wood! What a horrible trick to play!"
Rarity,Hmm. Has anypony seen my decorative centerpieces? They were right here.
Professor Fossil,Good luck!
Twilight Sparkle,"So, join me in welcoming Professor Rockhoof to our faculty!"
Rockhoof,"Thank you! Thank you, all! I know I'm new to your world, but there's one thing I learned when I saved my village from a rushing river of hot lava. There's nothing you can't do with hard work. And a shovel!"
Smolder,Except maybe stand on stage.
Twilight Sparkle,"So, um... everycreature dismissed. We'll... see you in class!"
Smolder,You think that new pony is gonna be the weirdest teacher at school or just one of the weirdest?
Yona,Yona like new teacher. He big like yak!
Gallus,"And he smashes things like a yak, smells like a yak..."
Yona,Yes! He perfect!
Sandbar,"Guys, he's one of the Pillars! He's like... pony history!"
Rockhoof,"Hello, class!"
Rockhoof,"Eh, um... [clears throat] I'm, uh, your new ""Theory and Defense of Friendship"" teacher."
Rockhoof,"But, uh, I haven't had a chance to look at Headmare Twilight's notes yet. What have you all been learnin'?"
Ocellus,We just studied all about how Princess Celestia and Luna used a spell to trap Discord in stone sleep for hundreds of moons.
Rockhoof,"Ohhhh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! So it's a class about stories, is it?"
Gallus,"Stories! Yeah! And we never, ever, ever get homework!"
Rockhoof,Good! The best way to teach colts and fillies is by experience. Like the time I was in the woods and I ran across an ursa major!
Silverstream,Really?!
Sandbar,"We're not doing that, right?"
Yona,You fight ursa major? All alone?
Rockhoof,"Aye. And I defeated her, too."
Smolder,Now this I'm interested in!
Yona,How Professor Rockhoof win?
Rockhoof,Well... that's quite a tale.
Twilight Sparkle,"From what Professor Fossil said, it sounds like Rockhoof just hasn't settled into modern times yet. Our school is the perfect place for that. Plus, we get a new teacher."
Applejack,[chuckles] This may be the fastest friendship problem you ever solved.
Rockhoof,Dodge! Thrust! Shovel leap! Shovel throw!
Rockhoof,"Shovel whack! Now you lot be the ursa major. Lots o' growlin', mind?"
Applejack,Maybe classrooms were less breakable in the old days?
Yona,Ooh-ooh-ooh! What happened next?
Rockhoof,"[laughing] The huge beastie jumped out of the moonlit mist, her fearsome fangs at my throat! But I rolled clear."
Silverstream,Then what?
Rockhoof,"She backed me up against a wall, ready to pounce!"
Rockhoof,I looked at her. She looked at me. And I say<U+0097>!
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, Professor Rockhoof?"
Rockhoof,"Nope! Guess again! [clears throat] Uh, oops."
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry to interrupt. Class, why don't we go ahead and take lunch early today? Rockhoof, can we take a walk outside?"
Twilight Sparkle,Our school is about finding your own special way to teach.
Twilight Sparkle,But maybe you could do a little less smashing in the classroom?
Twilight Sparkle,I know it's a big change. But I think you're gonna fit in just<U+0097>
Rockhoof,Fire!
Twilight Sparkle,"Rockhoof, wait!"
Rockhoof,No time! The building's ablaze! We have to get everypony out!
Yona,Professor Rockhoof best teacher ever! [sighs] Day cannot get better.
Rockhoof,"Let's get you outside, wee ones!"
Yona,Day just got better!
Rockhoof,Alley-oop!
Applejack,Rockhoof?
Twilight Sparkle,What are you doing?!
Rockhoof,Savin' the school!
Rockhoof,Just like fightin' a volcano in the good old days!
Rarity,Would somepony kindly explain what is the meaning of all this water?!
Pinkie Pie,I'm not sure. But I think it's surf's up! Woo-hoo! Cowabunga!
Rockhoof,"Sorry, Rarity, but I had to put out the ragin' inferno."
Spike,Inferno? Where?
Rockhoof,Did you not see the smoke and flame?
Smolder,"Yeah, that was us. You know, dragons? Having a fire-breathing competition?"
Rockhoof,"You, uh... what?"
Twilight Sparkle,[panting] They do it all the time. That's what we were trying to tell you.
Applejack,"We know you're used to bein' a hero, Rockhoof. Only what we need here is a teacher."
Rarity,One who doesn't ruin an entire class's friendship quilts. Do you know how hard it is to stitch a pineapple pattern?!
Rockhoof,[sighs] My deepest apologies. I'm not used to living with dragons or much else in this modern time. Professor Fossil made it clear I'm not welcome back in my old village. Seems I don't belong here either.
Pinkie Pie,Wheeeee!
Twilight Sparkle,"So apparently, finding Rockhoof a new job is a lot harder than we thought. Has anypony had any luck?"
Applejack,I-I thought you were gonna try him out at the post office.
Twilight Sparkle,We did.
Rockhoof,[yelling] Do you know where I can find Cranky Doodle Donkey?! I need to deliver his medicine! He has a rash in a very embarrassing place!
Spike,[shudders] I did not need to hear that.
Rarity,Yup. Rockhoof's time as a spa masseuse didn't work out either.
Rockhoof,Now just let me know if this is too much pressure!
Rainbow Dash,"W-Well, at least Rockhoof's really strong. Maybe we could find him a job carrying heavy stuff?"
Pinkie Pie,"I tried that already. Zecora needed somepony to help her get supplies, but..."
Rockhoof,"I know you said you only needed a few leaves, but I figured why not bring you the whole thing?"
Rarity,"Oh, how horrid."
Fluttershy,None of the other Pillars seem to be having trouble fitting into the modern world.
Applejack,Then maybe they can show Rockhoof how they did it. Get him used to livin' in this time.
Twilight Sparkle,Great idea! Rockhoof's old friends would be happy to help. And I bet he'd love to visit them.
Rockhoof,[sighs] Even Canterlot looks different from the old days.
Applejack,"Aww. I'm sure once you see your old pal Flash Magnus, you'll feel right at home."
Flash Magnus,"Trot, two, three, four! Trot, two, three, four! Keep it lively, rookies! Visitors on site! Company, halt! Rockhoof, you old ditch-digger you!"
Rockhoof,"Flash Magnus, as I live and breathe! Is this your squadron?"
Flash Magnus,"After we got out of limbo, I went looking for work for a pony with experience in the Royal Legion. Once a soldier, always a soldier."
Twilight Sparkle,Princess Celestia was happy to find a new drill sergeant for her guard!
Rockhoof,Uh... that's great. She really put you in a job that big so soon?
Flash Magnus,"Ho-ho, this is nothing. You should see what Mistmane is up to."
Rockhoof,They made you the royal landscape artist for the Crystal Empire?
Applejack,Wow...
Twilight Sparkle,Your work is beautiful.
Mistmane,"Oh, thank you. I've never worked with crystal before, but in my heart, I know I'm where I belong."
Rockhoof,You always could find the beauty in things. But there's not much demand for shovel ponies like me nowadays.
Mistmane,Don't give up hope. See Somnambula. She'll help you find your purpose.
Twilight Sparkle,[whispering] Somnambula's a motivational speaker. Bet they didn't even have those back in your time.
Rockhoof,[whispering] Because we didn't need them. Ponies knew what to do with their lives.
Somnambula,Focus on my voice and feel yourself unlock your potential. [inhaling and exhaling] Imagine everything that troubles you as one big cloud. Now let it float away. You are relaxed. Free to do anything you wish.
Applejack,Guess he wished he could take a nap?
Rockhoof,"Mage Meadowbrook, your home looks just the same as the old days. Wish I could say the same for mine."
Mage Meabowbrook,"Well, I've had to expand my clinic a bit. Many creatures need healin' in this modern world. Aww. Looks like you could use some, too. What's got you heartsick, Rockhoof?"
Rockhoof,"Thing is, I can't do my old job like Flash. Or adapt like Mistmane. Or succeed at something new like Somnambula. Or go home, like you."
Mage Meabowbrook,Give it time. Even Star Swirl's still learnin' about friendship.
Applejack,Yeah! And I bet Stygian took plenty o' time to fit in.
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, look what I found! Me and My Shadow, the third hit novel by former villain Stygian! I'm impressed! He's really thriving!"
Twilight Sparkle,Rockhoof? Where are you going?
Rockhoof,I'm not sure. Maybe I just don't belong in this modern world.
Applejack,"Now this here's a right mash of apples. 'Stead of solvin' Rockhoof's problem, we made him feel even worse."
Rainbow Dash,I'll tell you the real problem here. We haven't given Rockhoof the chance to be who he really is.
Pinkie Pie,A pony with a metal shovel and a heart of gold?
Rainbow Dash,Ugh. A hero! What we need to do is find him a job that's as epic as he is!
Twilight Sparkle,Hmm. I might know just the thing.
Rockhoof,"I'm honored to serve in the Hippogriff Navy, General Seaspray! I promise I'll prove my worth."
Seaspray,"Think nothing of it. I know how hard it is to adapt to a new home. After our many years below the waves, land customs seemed strange."
Rockhoof,"Like you didn't fit in, no matter how hard you tried?"
Seaspray,"As though the world had moved on without us. Never fear, Rockhoof. We shall be as brothers in this bright future above the waves."
Applejack,"[whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Uh, why do the Hippogriffs need ships if they can turn into seaponies?"
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe they just like cruises?
Hippogriff Sailor,General! The fog's too thick to see our way out of the harbor!
Seaspray,"Heave to, swabbies! Halt the ship and hold her 'til the fog passes!"
Rockhoof,"Wait, General! We can navigate the same way my Coltic ancestors traveled through the Selkie Mists! We'll look to the stars! There in the northwest sky is the constellation O'Bridle's Pelt! Steer the ship toward that!"
Seaspray,"You heard the pony, crew! Make full sail!"
Applejack,Yee-haw! Rockhoof did it!
Rockhoof,But... I don't understand! The stars have always steered me true!
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, no. Stars can move slowly over time. They must look different now than over a thousand years ago."
Seaspray,"It was an honor serving with you, Rockhoof. But it seems our paths lie in different directions."
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, mistakes happen. We'll think of something else for you to do."
Rockhoof,"Oh, there's no need, lass. I already know what I want to do next."
Applejack,Really? What?
Rockhoof,I heard there's a statue spell that sends creatures into stone sleep. I want you to cast it. On me.
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Rockhoof,Yes!
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Rockhoof,Aye!
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Rockhoof,Aye!
Spike,"Hey, guys. Need me to help you decide something?"
Twilight Sparkle,Rockhoof wants me to cast a spell to turn him into a statue! The answer is no!
Spike,Whoa. I thought you were arguing over ice cream flavors.
Twilight Sparkle,The answer is still no! Why would you want to be turned into stone?
Rockhoof,Because I'm a relic of a bygone age. I belong in a museum. Safe. Preserved. Untouched. I don't belong in this time. It's up to you to make that right.
Twilight Sparkle,But there has to be a better way!
Rockhoof,"Twilight, please understand. I want to be remembered as the hero I was, not the disappointment I've become."
Twilight Sparkle,"But you're not! Rockhoof, wait! Spike, can you teach my class today?"
Spike,"Uh, you're not really going to turn him to stone, are you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Only because it's temporary. As soon as I think of a new solution, we'll wake Rockhoof up. I know he has more to offer the world as a pony than a statue."
Sandbar,Did you hear Rockhoof caught all the bees in the Everfree Forest and gave 'em to Zecora as a gift?
Silverstream,Wow! Terramar said Rockhoof called down the stars and sunk the whole Hippogriff Navy!
Smolder,"He's definitely weird, but in a fun way. You never know what's gonna happen next with him."
Yona,Professor Rockhoof best pony!
Spike,"Hey, class. Welcome to the Theory and Defense of Friendship."
Gallus,Another sub? Let me start by telling you we don't get homework and we only do field trips.
Spike,Yeeeeah. Nice try. Twilight sent me to tell you she won't be in today 'cause she has to cast a stone sleep spell on Rockhoof.
Ocellus,Like Discord?! But why?! Rockhoof isn't a bad guy!
Spike,"[""I don't know"" sound] Your instructions are to write an essay on heroism and what it means to you."
Yona,No!
Spike,"Oh, don't worry. It doesn't have to be a long essay."
Rockhoof,"Maybe like this? Or on three legs? Hmm. What will give the wee birds fewer places to, uh... decorate?"
Yona,Professor Rockhoof! Dragon said you want to turn into stone! Yona not believe it!
Rockhoof,"Aye, I'm afraid it's true, lass."
Yona,But... pony need finish ursa major story for class!
Rockhoof,"Oh, it's sweet of you to try to get me to stay, Yona. But I'm afraid old stories like mine aren't worth anything in this day and age."
Yona,"Fine! If pony no want tell Yona story, then Yona tell pony story! From class report! [reading] ""When Yona come to pony school, Yona not fit in. Pony ways strange. But Yona find friends! Yona meet Professor Rockhoof! Pony brave and strong as yak! Not afraid! Hero! When Yona grow up, Yona want to be just like Professor Rockhoof!"""
Rockhoof,"Well, uh, since you went to the trouble of writing something that nice, I suppose the least I could do is tell you the rest of the story."
Yona,Yona tell whole school Rockhoof is best! Now all want to hear story!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, I have the spell. But will you please reconsider? Rockhoof?"
Rockhoof,The ursa major tried to grab me by the gullet! But I ducked her claws!
Rockhoof,She had me cornered. So I look at her. She looks at me.
Rockhoof,"And I say, ""Sorry you won't be having any dinner tonight, lass! Guess you'll just have to... grin and bear it!"""
Rockhoof,And then I tossed her away with my shovel high into the sky! And she's been a constellation up there ever since! Or so I'm told. And that's the end of my story.
Students,One more story! One more story!
Rockhoof,"No, no. Thank you for listening. But it's time to say goodbye."
Twilight Sparkle,Wait. You said there wasn't anything in this time you were good at. What about telling stories?
Rockhoof,It was just a tall tale.
Twilight Sparkle,One that captured the hearts and imagination of everycreature here.
Yona,"Plus, pony story super fun!"
Twilight Sparkle,"As the Princess of Friendship, I'd like to appoint you as Equestria's official keeper of tales!"
Spike,Can you do that?
Twilight Sparkle,Eh.
Rockhoof,"I, uh... That's very kind of you. But I still think these old bones are more suited to a museum display."
Twilight Sparkle,"You are a living record of our history. Your stories can inspire and teach generations to come. If you're a statue, that's all lost."
Rockhoof,But will I ever really belong in your world?
Yona,Rockhoof Yona's friend. So Rockhoof belongs!
Rockhoof,"You know... That reminds me of another story. Once, there was a small yak that knew more than a great hero."
Smolder,"Hey, don't forget the dragons in this one!"
Rockhoof,"Aye, there were dragons. And ponies. And plenty of Hippogriffs. Plus a changeling and a griffon..."
Twilight Sparkle,"The Tree of Harmony remains one of the most powerful sources of magic known to ponydom. And though it has been at the ""root"" of magic and friendship from the moment it was planted, its ways are mysterious. Almost as if it has a mind of its own."
Smolder,Mind? [scoffs] It's a tree.
Twilight Sparkle,A tree that grew a castle.
Silverstream,Was that before or after Discord made chocolate rain?
Cozy Glow,[whispers] After.
Gallus,I'm never gonna learn pony history!
Twilight Sparkle,"You can all show me what you've learned on tomorrow's test <U+0096> ""Friendship's Effect on the Course of Equestrian History""."
Twilight Sparkle,Remember! Study groups are both fun and effective!
Sandbar,"So, who wants to study together?"
Gallus,"With other students? This is Equestria! If you want the real scoop, there's only one place to go. Hello, oh maaaaagical Equestrian tree! Can you tell me everything I need to know about friendship?"
Smolder,The Elements of Harmony grew the Tree?
Ocellus,No! The Pillars grew the Tree.
Sandbar,"The Tree grew the Elements, and then the box with six locks."
Ocellus,But our professors found six keys and unlocked the box.
Gallus,I'm so gonna fail.
Silverstream,You guys! Check this out!
Gallus,That's a plumbing diagram on how to fix a sink.
Sandbar,What does that have to do with Equestrian history?
Silverstream,Nothing. I just can't believe that's how sinks work! Where's Yona?
Smolder,"[laughs] Apparently, [imitating Yona] yaks no love study groups!"
Yona,[snoring] Spider! No!
Sandbar,"Hey, Cozy. What are you doing here?"
Cozy Glow,"I volunteered to help Professor Sparkle organize these books. So, experts on Equestrian history yet?"
Gallus,I think I'd be better off studying the plumbing book. This stuff is impossible.
Ocellus,"Oh, come on, Gallus! With good friends and solid study habits, anything is possible!"
Smolder,"How about you just tell us what's on tomorrow's test, professor?"
Ocellus,"Now, hold on a sec. I can't give y'all a sneak peek. That there wouldn't be honest."
Cozy Glow,"[clears throat] Golly, it's so inspiring how relaxed you all are about studying friendship, considering your disadvantage."
Yona,What cute pony mean?
Cozy Glow,"Just consider where you all came from. If Sandbar hadn't sacrificed so much of his time to get you up to speed, who knows how behind you'd be?"
Sandbar,That's... not what<U+0097>
Cozy Glow,"[to Ocellus] I mean, growing up as a love-starved changeling? [to Silverstream] Or hiding underwater from an evil king all those years? Trusting anycreature must be so hard for you. [to Gallus] And griffons never want to be around anycreature, even other griffons. [to Smolder] And dragons are so fierce compared to us. There must be days you can't wait to get away from all us cute ponies. [to Yona, imitating Yona] ""Everypony know yaks think yaks are best!"" Making friends with any other creature must seem like a step down. It's just so impressive how you keep trying to understand friendship, even though it isn't in your nature. Oh! I'll let you borrow my notes! It's what friends do. I'll be right back!"
Silverstream,We... should... get back to studying.
Gallus,Could you stop that clicking?! I'm trying to focus!
Sandbar,Dude!
Gallus,What? We have a test. I don't know every detail about every adventure the professors went on like you do.
Ocellus,That's why we're studying together.
Smolder,"Right. To help us ""disadvantaged"" creatures."
Yona,Yona confused. Why we all upset?
Silverstream,"I only glanced at that plumbing book, but I'm pretty sure this isn't supposed to be here."
Ocellus,What are you doing?
Smolder,Dragon. Strange magical cave. What do you think I'm doing?
Silverstream,Did we know this was down here?
Sandbar,I don't think anypony knows this is down here.
Illusion Twilight Sparkle,[stilted] Welcome.
Sandbar,Headmare Twilight? Where are we?
Illusion Twilight Sparkle,[stilted] Where you need to be.
Yona,"Uh, Yona confused."
Illusion Twilight Sparkle,[stilted] It is as I feared. You are not one. What has happened?
Ocellus,"We were studying friendship's effect on history, but then..."
Gallus,"Since friendship just isn't in our nature, what's the point?"
Illusion Twilight Sparkle,[stilted] You do not believe friendship is in your nature? That is NOT acceptable!
Silverstream,"Our headmare is glowing, you guys. What is going on?!"
Ocellus,We should probably get back to studying for the test.
Illusion Twilight Sparkle,"A test. Yes. By sunrise, this door will be closed. Finish the test before then, and you may go. Fail the test, and here you will stay."
Sandbar,Huh?
Gallus,Huh?
Smolder,Huh?
Silverstream,Ooh!
Silverstream,Mount Aris? Headmare Twilight sent me home? Wait. Am I suspended? Hello? Anygriff here? Hmm. They must be topside.
Silverstream,The Storm King?! He's back?!
Gallus,Big room. No exits. Big deal.
Yona,Nothing for yaks to be afraid of. Just empty cave. Nothing in here can hurt<U+0097>
Yona,...Yona.
Smolder,Ugh. Things like this just don't happen in the Dragon Lands. Huh?
Stepford Pony 1,...And I told her she was the cutest pony of all ponies!
Stepford Pony 2,[to Smolder] Ohhh! Aren't you just the most adorable thing? Come join us.
Smolder,No. On so many levels. No.
Smolder,Huh?
Stepford Pony 1,"Come sit by me, and let's compliment each other!"
Ocellus,[gasps] Why do you look like that?
Changeling 1,What do you mean? We all look the same.
Ocellus,Not me.
Changeling 2,Of course not you... your Majesty. We'll go drain the love from those pathetic ponies in Ponyville just as you ordered.
Ocellus,"[whimpers, gasps] Nooooo!"
Illusion Rarity,Oh! Thank heavens we found you!
Illusion Rainbow Dash,"There's an emergency! And we need you, Sandbar!"
Sandbar,"[gasps] My first friendship adventure! Yes! Count me in! Oh, I've been waiting for this<U+0097> Wait! The others!"
Illusion Rainbow Dash,We don't need them! We need you! Come on!
Gallus,"Aah! Come on, Gallus. Get it together. Deep breaths. [inhaling and exhaling] Ah... Ahh... Achoo!"
Gallus,"[panicked whimpering] Okay. If this is a test, there's got to be a way out. It's just a puzzle... that will squash you if you don't figure it out."
Gallus,Oops.
Smolder,[groans] Look. I have to get out of here and find my friends. So just tell me what I have to do to pass this test. I'm not afraid of anything.
Stepford Pony 2,"Um, I dunno. Seems like she's afraid to be cute and adorable, doesn't it?"
Stepford Pony 1,Or maybe she's just afraid to admit she likes being cute and adorable.
Stepford Pony 2,Mm-hmm!
Smolder,"Just this once. [clears throat, cute voice] May I have some tea, please?"
Stepford Pony 1,"Aw, but you can't have tea if you aren't dressed for it."
Smolder,Okay. But let's keep this between us.
Yona,Huh?
Yona,Yona... no mean to scream. Yona love making friends. Spiders friends?
Yona,Wait. What little spider say?
Smolder,What happened to you?
Gallus,What happened to you?
Smolder,You never saw any of that. Got it?
Gallus,Maybe the others got out already and we're the last ones?
Smolder,"[sarcastic] Yeah, that totally seems like something they would do."
Gallus,[groans] Any other dragon or griffon would save themselves and get out of this crazy cave.
Smolder,Guess we aren't just any dragon or griffon anymore.
Gallus,Guess not. You go that way. I'll check over there.
Sandbar,Wait. I really should find my friends.
Illusion Rarity,"Darling, it was so generous of you to take the time to teach those other creatures about friendship."
Illusion Rainbow Dash,"But if you're going to join us and do something that really makes a difference, we need to know where your loyalty lies."
Illusion Rarity,"You do want to impress us, don't you, Sandbar?"
Smolder,Huh? Ocellus?
Ocellus,Go away.
Smolder,We're still in those weird caves beneath the school. We've gotta get out of here. [gasps] Chrysalis! Where's Ocellus?!
Gallus,Hello?!
Gallus,Where are<U+0097>? Whoa!
Silverstream,Shhhh! The Storm King will hear you!
Gallus,The Storm King? He was defeated. We're still under the school. This is all just some crazy test.
Gallus,"Okay, that's horrifying."
Silverstream,I can't find any Hippogriffs or seaponies. They must all be captured! Gallus! Get back down here!
Gallus,It's not real.
Silverstream,"Yes, it is! He's back, and I'm never gonna see another sunset or fly through a cloud bank or study plumbing! He's gonna take away everything I love! I'm gonna be trapped down here forever!"
Gallus,"I'm afraid of being trapped, too! I'm scared of small spaces."
Silverstream,Really?
Gallus,"Yeah. And I was stuck in a room that kept shrinking. But I realized I had to face my fear, and I found the way out. This is your test. He isn't really here."
Silverstream,But what if he is?
Gallus,Then tell him exactly what you think of him.
Silverstream,Ha-ha! I did it! I told him!
Gallus,Okay. Heh. Hug time later. W-We still have to get back to the library.
Smolder,You're a changeling. Just change back.
Ocellus,I can't.
Ocellus,"Maybe my past was so horrible, it's still inside me just waiting to come out again."
Smolder,That's ridiculous. That's not who you are anymore. You've changed.
Ocellus,Maybe we can't really change that much.
Smolder,"[muffled] I like cute, silly stuff."
Ocellus,"I'm sorry, what?"
Smolder,"I like cute, silly stuff! But ever since school started, I've realized that sometimes I kinda don't mind cute stuff."
Smolder,"If a dragon like me can admit she likes tea parties, that's proof we can change. I was gonna invite you to a top-secret tea party with me, but if you want to stay down here..."
Ocellus,Oh! No! I want to come!
Smolder,"I thought that might work. Come on, let's go!"
Silverstream,Where's Yona and Sandbar?
Gallus,The way out is closing!
Smolder,We aren't leaving without them!
Yona,Yona find you guys!
Silverstream,"Hey, Yona. Who's your... spider army?"
Yona,Yona always scared of spiders. But then Yona meet Spindle.
Yona,Yona realize no reason to be afraid. Spiders and yak friends! So Yona ask new friends to help finding old friends!
Gallus,Do you think your new friends can help us find Sandbar?
Smolder,"Of all the strange things that have happened tonight, that's the strangest, right?"
Sandbar,"Okay, enough! I'm not going anywhere without my friends!"
Illusion Rainbow Dash,So you don't care about anypony but your friends? Are you really that selfish?
Illusion Rarity,"Honestly, you really are such a disappointment."
Sandbar,"I've always looked up to you. You would never turn your back on each other, and that's what makes you strong. Now I have a group of friends that I think is every bit as amazing as yours. If I have to give up on them to make you proud, then you aren't the ponies I thought you were. I don't care if I disappoint you. You disappoint me."
Silverstream,Did you just tell our professors you were disappointed in them?
Sandbar,"Something tells me those weren't actually our professors. Besides, they tried to get between me and my friends."
Smolder,"That's all very sweet. Now, can we please get out of here?!"
Sandbar,"[grunting] You! You're not Headmare Twilight, are you?"
Ocellus,[gasps] You're the Tree of Harmony!
Silverstream,The Tree of Harmony turned into a sparkly version of our headmare to talk to us? Did I miss a chapter in class?
Tree of Harmony,"Like all living things, I change as I grow. As I have grown, so have my abilities."
Gallus,I'm a bit rusty on pony history. But since when does the Tree of Harmony trap creatures in a cave with their biggest fears?!
Tree of Harmony,"You chose what you saw in my roots, not me."
Sandbar,[gasps] Our friendship got us past our fears!
Tree of Harmony,"You were more concerned with each other's well-being than your own. You were strong when your friends were weak. You let each other in and showed that you would be there for each other, no matter what. Friendship is in your nature."
Gallus,"W-We just learned a friendship lesson from a tree, didn't we?"
Cozy Glow,You're all right! I came back with my notes and saw this and didn't know what to think!
Silverstream,We're better than all right! We just got tested by the Tree of Harmony! And we totally passed!
Cozy Glow,The Tree of Harmony? Here?
Silverstream,"Yeah! Well, below here. Under the school! We found this and went down and met the Tree, and Gallus was all, [imitating Gallus] ""Friendship is not in our nature."" And the Tree was like, ""Whaaaaat?!"" And it tested us!"
Smolder,"Long story short, friendship is in our nature. The Tree said so."
Ocellus,I guess we should tell somepony there's a giant magical hole in the library.
Ocellus,Or not.
Sandbar,We have to tell our professors about this! They won't believe that<U+0097>!
Cozy Glow,You can't!
Yona,Why no?
Cozy Glow,"Because... it's my fault. You were all getting along so well, and I felt left out. I was jealous. And it upset you so much, the Tree of Harmony had to test you. [gasps] Oh! I'm gonna get expelled for sure! [crying] Please don't tell anypony about this! Especially the professors! Please, please, please<U+0097>!"
Smolder,Okay! [yawns] I'm actually too tired to do anything right now.
Sandbar,"Yeah, but we can't go to sleep. We'll miss the test."
Gallus,[yawns] The test! I almost forgot!
Ocellus,[yawns] We're all gonna fail.
Cozy Glow,"What if I tell Professor Sparkle I needed help organizing these books, and you were all kind enough to pitch in? I'll get you an extension!"
Sandbar,"[yawns] Thanks, Cozy. That's nice of you."
Cozy Glow,I'm just so sorry I caused all of this. You're such good friends. I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
Cozy Glow,You get some rest. Don't give any of this another thought. Just let Cozy take care of everything.
Twilight Sparkle,I can't believe you two are going on a friendship quest! This is amazing!
Applejack,"What do you mean, Twilight? We've been on one together before."
Twilight Sparkle,Exactly! This is the first time the map has teamed up the same ponies for a second quest!
Fluttershy,That is special.
Applejack,Heh. Must be 'cause we're extra good at solvin' friendship problems.
Twilight Sparkle,"I hope so, 'cause it looks like this one might be a little tricky. You're going to the Peaks of Peril."
Fluttershy,The Peaks of... P-P-Peril?!
Applejack,"Aw, it's just a name. It doesn't mean anythin'."
Fluttershy,Like how Cloudsdale is in the clouds and the Crystal Empire's made of crystal?
Applejack,"Fair point. So, what can ya tell us about the place, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Only what Rockhoof told me. Back in his day, nopony knew much about the Peaks of Peril except for the legend on this ancient shield. It says a group called the Kirin used to live there, known for their kindness and truth-speaking."
Applejack,Now we know why the Map called us.
Twilight Sparkle,"Unfortunately, other creatures also lived there. The Nirik, fearsome beasts of pure fire."
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry, Fluttershy. Flanks don't lie."
Applejack,"Aw, I'm sure the two of us'll get that friendship problem solved, no matter what kind o' creature has it."
Applejack,Guess nopony else is goin' out as far as we are.
Fluttershy,Maybe they know something we don't?
Applejack,"Now, Fluttershy, I've told you a dozen times. There's nothin' to be sca<U+0097>"
Ticket Taker Pony,I'm sorry.
Fluttershy,[screams] You really startled us.
Ticket Taker Pony,"Oh, it's just that I'm not used to seeing anypony taking the train to... [ominously] the end of the line. The final destination. The last stop!"
Applejack,We get the picture. Why?
Applejack,"Well, maybe there's a little somethin' to be scared of."
Applejack,Yah!
Fluttershy,There. That should be enough flowers to keep your tree cozy.
Applejack,"Fluttershy! What are you doin'?! This is no time for visitin' varmints! We're on a friendship quest, remember?!"
Fluttershy,"Yes, but actua<U+0097>"
Applejack,Come on! We're burnin' daylight!
Fluttershy,"I know, but what I found out is that<U+0097>"
Applejack,"Now, we gotta get up that peak! I figure if we use some rope and elbow grease, we can make it up half<U+0097>"
Fluttershy,Applejack! Can you please listen to me?! [clears throat] What I'm trying to say is the squirrels told me a shortcut they take to the Kirin village.
Applejack,"Oh. [chuckles] Sorry, Fluttershy. I suppose I got a little too caught up in the adventure."
Fluttershy,"That's all right. If you hadn't come back to get me, I probably would've talked to the squirrels all day. Heh."
Applejack,Show yourself!
Applejack,"Well, hi. I'm Applejack, and this here's Fluttershy."
Fluttershy,"If you have any friendship problems, we're here to help."
Applejack,"Huh. [to Fluttershy] Quiet bunch, ain't they? [clears throat] We're from Equestria, and we're plumb tickled to meet y'all."
Applejack,"S-So, uh... what are your names?"
Applejack,[stressing] Ap-ple-jack! Flut-ter-shy! Remember?
Fluttershy,"[whispering, to Applejack] Maybe they don't understand us."
Applejack,[stressing] Do. You. Un-der-stand. Ponish?
Fluttershy,Oh! But you don't speak?
Applejack,Don't or won't?
Fluttershy,"Will you excuse us for a moment? [to Applejack] You have to ask yes-or-no questions, or they won't answer."
Applejack,Like talkin' to Angel Bunny?
Fluttershy,Not exactly. I can always tell what Angel is feeling. But these Kirin don't show anything.
Applejack,"Well, how are we gonna solve a friendship problem if none of 'em will tell us what it is?"
Applejack,"These Kirin are quieter than an apple blossom on snowfall. Still, there's gotta be some way to make 'em speak. [chuckles] Beautiful day, ain't it?"
Applejack,"[whinny] Knock, knock! Now you say, ""Who's there?"""
Applejack,"Police. ""Police who?"" Police [please] say somethin'!"
Applejack,Uh-oh! I feel a sneeze comin' on! Aaaa-CHOOOOO!
Fluttershy,Gesundheit.
Applejack,[groans] Don't any o' y'all talk?!
Applejack,Now we're gettin' somewhere.
Fluttershy,A dark spooky path that leads into unknown territory?
Applejack,"Tell you what, sugarcube. You stay and see if you can get anythin' outta these here Kirin. I'll go and try to find one that talks."
Fluttershy,Phew! Be careful. And watch out for Niriks!
Applejack,[yelps] Phew! [yelps] Oh. Have you seen a Kirin that talks?
Applejack,Any idea where I should look?
Applejack,"Oh, for the love of Celestia! Can't ya just say somethin'?!"
Autumn Blaze,"[giggles] Gotcha! Sorry, sorry, but that was too good. Oh, you don't know how much I missed jokes. Hi-larity! Am I pronouncing that right? Some words I haven't said in a will. While! While. Hi, I'm Autumn Blaze. You've just arrived, and perhaps you're tired or hungry or reflective and want to sleep and eat and journal? Which you should do, of course! But first<U+0097> Oh! Oh, what joy to talk with another creature! It's been so long! You must tell me everything about you! There's so much to say, so much to do! Oh, look at me. I'm going on, and you haven't seen<U+0097> I mean, have you seen<U+0097>? W-What am I saying? Of course you haven't. So just<U+0097> I<U+0097> yeah<U+0097> I will j<U+0097> Follow me!"
Applejack,"That... was somethin', all right."
Applejack,"Oh, wow. [gasps] This... is amazin'."
Autumn Blaze,"Oh, you think so, too?! The way the light shimmers off everything, like, like it all suddenly woke up the moment you saw it. And you realize maybe the water and the mountains and the forest and the... yes, the rainbow and the stars and the sky are all looking back at you thinking the same thing? That we are a part of the everything. That maybe there's just one thing and we are all it."
Applejack,I was gonna say it's pretty. But yeah.
Autumn Blaze,"[hums, sniffs] Mmmm! And this is just the first stop on a journey of amazing things to see, smell, tiptoe through. Oh, I haven't been able to share all of this with anypony in forever! Since they all took that vow of silence. So it's a lot for me to pro-cess. Process? Uh, deal with."
Applejack,Whoa there. Vow of silence?
Autumn Blaze,"That's, uh... That's why they asked me to leave."
Applejack,"I hope it's not a sore subject, but... you mind explainin' why y'all went quiet in the first place?"
Autumn Blaze,It's a long story.
Applejack,[sighs] You'd rather not talk about it?
Autumn Blaze,No.
Applejack,I-I under<U+0097>
Autumn Blaze,[begins singing] I'd rather... siiiiiiiiiiiing!
Autumn Blaze,"La, la-la-la, la-la La-la-la, la-la-la"
Others,The Kirin used to speak and sing We weren't always quiet We told stories and funny jokes My stand-up was a riot
Others,"But then one day, a fight broke out And hurtful words were said Flaring tempers were inflamed Destruction quickly spread"
Others,And flaming bred from head to head It even burnt our... bread
Others,"Sorry, I forgot how much I love rhyming. Where was I? Oh, right!"
My happy village lay in ruins Relationships got worse Spoiler alert,we quickly learned That words could be a curse
Others,"""No more talking,"" yelled our leader The last thing said aloud Into the Stream of Silence We stepped as a crowd"
Others,The water cooled emotions And peace was soon restored But with no way to speak my thoughts I got super... bored
Others,"Seriously, there's only so long that Sudoku can keep you entertained!"
Others,"'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky Unless you let it rain And shiny apples sometimes come with worms No, you can't give up your laughter 'Cause you're scared of a little pain It's a lesson that the Kirin never learned"
Others,I was stuck in silent prison With the voices in my head 'Til I tripped over my salvation In a helpful flowerbed
Others,I found a cure to clear my pipes And I became quite chatty With years and years of stored-up words I drove my village batty
Others,"They didn't like my jokes and songs And daily dose of news The plays I wrote, the speeches spoke Variety revues"
Others,Or the story about the Kirin who hid below an opera stage
Others,"And fell in love with this opera singer, and he wore a freaky half-mask thing, and he played the organ a lot and got all broody 'cause the singer was in love with another dude, so he took her away on this underground gondola. I mean, who doesn't love musical theater?!"
Others,The village leader made it clear I had to make my choice I could stay and live with them Or I could keep my voice
Others,"So I came here, but left the couch alone They're hard to move With just the view for company Until ya heard me groove"
Others,"Take it away, boys!"
Others,"'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky Unless you let it rain And candles just won't glow until they're burned No, you can't give up your laughter 'Cause you're scared of a little pain It's a lesson that my village never learned"
Others,No matter how hard I schooled them Fear of hurt is still what ruled them Sometimes you gotta let it raaaaaaaain!
Others,"Yeah, sometimes you've gotta let it rain"
Applejack,[gasps] I can't believe it! Nopony should give up feelin'... their feelin's just to keep from gettin' angry!
Autumn Blaze,"That's what I said! You know, after I started talking again."
Applejack,[gasps] I bet this here's the problem that Fluttershy and I came to help y'all with!
Autumn Blaze,"Really? Who's Fluttershy? Oh! Did you name your shadow? Mine's called ""Silhouette Gloom of the Sundown Lands""."
Applejack,"Right... Well, I'm thinkin' if we just go talk to the other Kirin, we can get 'em to welcome you back proper-like. Maybe even convince 'em to take your cure."
Autumn Blaze,"Oh, yes! Yes, of course! Oh, just one small thing. The antidote from my anecdote? It's gone."
Applejack,There's no cure left?!
Autumn Blaze,I used the last of the foal's-breath flowers to make it. And I-I haven't seen them bloom since.
Applejack,"[sighs] Well, this wouldn't be a friendship quest if it was easy. I'm gonna start by gettin' your friends to welcome you back!"
Autumn Blaze,"You know, between you and me, I'm not sure she's gonna convince them. [deep voice] Nope! [normal voice] But... [whispering] I hope she does."
Applejack,[panting] Fluttershy! Guess what!
Applejack,Bet that's a problem the Kirin never have.
Fluttershy,[giggles] No.
Applejack,"Anyhow, we gotta get 'em all talkin' again."
Fluttershy,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no! We can't ever let that happen!"
Applejack,I thought you said you figured out the friendship problem. Was somethin' lost in translation?
Fluttershy,"The Kirin are usually peaceful and kind. But when they get mad, they turn into Niriks, creatures made of fire and vengeance!"
Applejack,Heh. That seemed less scary when it was in a song.
Fluttershy,"The last time they all argued, they got so angry, they accidentally destroyed their whole village. So the Kirin decided to make sure it would never happen again."
Applejack,But that's no reason to stop talkin'.
Fluttershy,"Yes, it is! Fire is dangerous, especially in a forest like this. Why, think of all the animals it could hurt."
Applejack,Not if they don't turn into fire-breathin' Nirik in the first place.
Fluttershy,And how can you be sure that won't happen?
Applejack,There's gotta be a better way than givin' up all your feelin's!
Fluttershy,Applejack! You're not listening!
Applejack,'Cause you're not talkin' any sense!
Fluttershy,"Um, what are they doing?"
Fluttershy,[grunts] Maybe they got worried because we were arguing with each other.
Applejack,"Aw, shucks! We were just havin' a normal, civil disagreement! Honest!"
Applejack,"To the Stream of Silence! If we hit that water, we'll never be able to talk or feel anythin' ever again!"
Autumn Blaze,[distorted] Put them down!
Applejack,It's all right. I think I know this one. And she's tryin' to help.
Autumn Blaze,"Well, yeah! Can't have them silence the only friend who'll speak to me."
Fluttershy,She talks?
Applejack,"You have no idea. Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze."
Fluttershy,"Well, thank you for that... um, wall of fire. But I thought Niriks were dangerous when they're angry. How did you know you could control your temper?"
Autumn Blaze,I didn't. Huh. I guess anger's like other feelings. It's not about having them. It's what you do with them.
Applejack,And givin' up happiness to keep away anger is no kind o' life.
Fluttershy,I never thought of it that way. I can't imagine not being able to talk to my animal friends.
Autumn Blaze,"Fern Flare, you used to love to laugh at everything. And Rain Shine, you sung the most beautiful harmonies. Don't you miss it?"
Applejack,I know you're worried about fightin'. But friends can disagree without causin' a ruckus.
Fluttershy,Everypony gets mad sometimes. Even Applejack and I argue.
Applejack,What?! When do we ever argue?
Fluttershy,[clears throat] On the way here? And about the Kirin being silent? And right now!
Applejack,We don't always see eye-to-eye. But we never let that get in the way of our friendship.
Fluttershy,"And if you're really angry, then take some time away to be a Nirik where it won't hurt anypony."
Applejack,I-I think they're tryin' to say somethin'.
Autumn Blaze,"Okay, are you hungry? Oh, no. Is some Kirin trapped in a well? Okay, ""baby"". ""Baby fish"". ""Ba""<U+0097> ""Ba""<U+0097> No. ""Baby fish mouth""? Uh, something? Anything?! [groans] Just write it down! [groans] This is making me furious. Would you excuse me? I'll be right back. [distorted scream] You were saying?"
Autumn Blaze,Ohhhh! You want the cure for the Stream of Silence!
Fluttershy,"That's wonderful! Uh, isn't it?"
Applejack,"Well, it would be. Except there aren't any flowers left to make the cure."
Fluttershy,Are you sure?
Autumn Blaze,"Oh, beyond sure. Believe me, I've had a lot of alone time lately. I searched the entire forest seventy-three and a half times. Although I wonder if that second half could make a difference."
Fluttershy,Hmm. I wish she'd told us what kind of flowers she's looking for.
Applejack,They're called foal's-breath.
Fluttershy,I've never heard of that.
Applejack,"Uh, Fluttershy? A little help?"
Fluttershy,[gasps] He says he knows where to find more foal's-breath!
Applejack,"Well, what are we waitin' for? Lead the way!"
Fluttershy,[gasps] That's what foal's-breath looks like?!
Applejack,Autumn Blaze never would've made it past the Peaks to search here. I owe you an apology.
Fluttershy,Why?
Applejack,"'Cause if your kindness hadn't made you stop to help the squirrels, we never would've found this here flower."
Fluttershy,"And if your honesty hadn't convinced the Kirin to talk, we wouldn't need to find it."
Applejack,"[chuckles] Guess it's a good thing the map sent both of us, huh?"
Autumn Blaze,"[gasps] You found them?! Where were they?! Tell me everything, and feel free to add complicated descriptions and comedic tangents!"
Autumn Blaze,Oh. Right. First things first.
Rain Shine,"Autumn Blaze, you have given us a gift. The realization that anger is within us, but it is our choice how we let it out. We would very much like it if you came back to live with us. I can't say how much we've missed your beautiful voice."
Autumn Blaze,"'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky  Unless you let it rain  And candles just won't glow until they're burned  No, you can't give up your laughter  'Cause you're scared of a little pain  It's a lesson that my village never learned"
Others,"Oh, yes, 'cause rainbows won't light up the sky  Unless you let it..."
Others,Raaaaaaaain!
Twilight Sparkle,Woo-hoo-hoo!
Spike,Whoa! Ta-da!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, Spike. Now let's try a flip. Remember <U+0096> two flaps, then straight up!"
Spike,Got it!
Twilight Sparkle,"You're doing great, Spike. Now let's see the big finish!"
Spike,Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
Spike,"[grunts] I don't know about ""big"", but I am definitely finished."
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe I should get Rainbow Dash. She's the one who taught me advanced flying techniques.
Spike,"No, thanks. If I'm gonna mess up, I'd rather do it in front of you. I just don't understand why none of your advice is helping."
Smolder,Because she's teaching you to fly like a pony instead of a dragon.
Spike,What's the difference?
Smolder,"Well, we don't have feathers, for starters."
Spike,Ye-he-he-hes!
Spike,Wow! Thank you so much! How did you know I just needed to bend my wings?
Smolder,"Honestly, this is Dragon 101. Usually dragon parents teach this stuff."
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, I've been thinking about our flying lesson."
Spike,Uh-huh...
Twilight Sparkle,"I can't believe I overlooked something as simple as feathers. It's no wonder you were having trouble. I wish I had more ""dragonish"" knowledge to give you. Do you think being raised by ponies has affected you in other ways? Spike?"
Spike,"Did you say something, Twilight? Sorry. I'm just finishing up this ""thank-you"" throw pillow for Smolder. And you know how I get when I'm in the embroidery zone."
Spike,It's a pillow! But not for your head. Although it could be. It's a throw pillow. They're more casual. You can use 'em anywhere. You don't like it.
Smolder,"Uh, it's not that. It's just dragons don't really use pillows. At all."
Spike,What?
Smolder,"Hey, what's that?"
Spike,I don't know. But it's... heading right for us!
Spike,Okay. Now I really owe you for the lesson.
Spike,You all right?
Smolder,Yeah. What happened?
Sludge,To what?
Sludge,Ow...
Spike,Maybe not. But you're hurt and need help. So I'm taking you to Twilight's castle whether you like it or not?
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm glad Spike brought you here, Sludge. I understand you made quite the impression in town."
Pinkie Pie,Literally! There's a hole and everything!
Applejack,It doesn't look like you're in much shape to do anything.
Rarity,"Darling, do be careful."
Sludge,I'm... [groans] ...fine.
Fluttershy,I can't watch!
Rainbow Dash,"You're not the first stubborn dragon we've met, you know?"
Spike,"And sometimes, even dragons need help."
Twilight Sparkle,I promise. My friends and I will only do enough to get you back on your claws.
Twilight Sparkle,"I know you had your reservations, but it's good to see you feeling better."
Sludge,"T-Thanks, I guess."
Rarity,"That's what friends are for, darling."
Sludge,"You're pretty lucky to have friends like these, kid."
Spike,"Actually, I was orphaned as an egg, and Twilight raised me. So these ponies are more than my friends. They're my family."
Twilight Sparkle,"We try our best, but sometimes I worry that maybe Spike is..."
Spike,Missing something deep down and dragonish.
Sludge,Really? Wow. I-I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that.
Applejack,Why in Equestria would you be glad to hear that?
Sludge,"I wasn't gonna say anything since your life seemed so perfect, but I have a confession to make. Coming to Ponyville wasn't an accident. I was looking for you. Spike... [sighs] I'm your father."
Pinkie Pie,[continues gasping] Sorry.
Twilight Sparkle,So you crashed in Ponyville on purpose?
Sludge,"Well, the crash part wasn't on purpose, but heading here was. I've been searching everywhere for you, kid."
Spike,Did you ask in the Crystal Empire? I'm kind of well-known there.
Pinkie Pie,"Actually, Spike's well-known everywhere. Not a lot of dragons were hatched by the Princess of Friendship."
Applejack,Mm-hmm.
Sludge,[choked up] You make it sound so simple. I wish you'd been there to help me search.
Spike,I can't believe it. I have so many questions.
Sludge,"Well, ask away. Answering questions is what dads are for."
Spike,I guess my biggest question is simple. Why was I an orphaned egg?
Sludge,[stammers] You sure you don't want to ask something else? [choked up] It's a lot of painful memories. [sighs] Your mother was the best dragon I'd ever met.
Sludge,"[voiceover] The Dragon Lord even picked her to scout for the Great Migration, and-and even though she just laid your egg, we knew she'd have to go. But finding the Migration route could take a lifetime, and you deserved a chance to know your mother. So I went looking for you, carrying your egg to places no dragon or pony has ever been. Past Mount Aris, the abandoned home of the Hippogriffs..."
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! Did you visit Klugetown?
Sludge,You've been to Klugetown?
Twilight Sparkle,"Also, the Hippogriffs returned to Mount Aris after we helped them defeat the Storm King."
Sludge,"Oh, well, have you heard of the Land of the... Scale Collectors?"
Twilight Sparkle,Uh-uh.
Sludge,[to Spike] Because that's where your mother's trail finally led.
Sludge,"[voiceover] To a prison world of dragon hunters, where I was forced to choose between surrendering myself or surrendering your egg."
Sludge,"[voiceover, choked up] Of course, there was no way I was gonna sacrifice my boy. So they took me instead, and that's where I'd been ever since."
Sludge,Locked up somewhere not even the Princess of Friendship has heard of.
Spike,Whoa... How did you know I was a boy?
Fluttershy,Whatever happened to Spike's mom?
Rainbow Dash,And how did the egg make it all the way back to Equestria by itself?
Pinkie Pie,Hmm?
Spike,"Well, that's all in the past. The only thing that matters now is that we're together. And I'm gonna make up for lost time."
Spike,"I hope you don't mind, but I have a list of all the things I always wanted to do with my dad?"
Sludge,"Mind? Spike, my boy, with you by my side, I feel like we could do anything. What do you want to do first?"
Spike,"Well, I've kind of been working on a list for a long time."
Sludge,"Dude, you want to do all of this?"
Spike,"Oh. I mean, w-we don't have to."
Sludge,"If you think doing everything on this incredibly long list is gonna fill the hole where your dragonishness should be, then that is exactly what we're gonna do!"
Pinkie Pie,Woo-hoo!
Spike,"Oh, yeah!"
Spike,I can't believe we got so many things done. But this is all my stuff. Is there anything you always wanted to do with me?
Sludge,Not really.
Sludge,"Uhhh, I mean, uh, I'm happy to do whatever you want. But if I had a castle like this with all this stuff, I'd probably just lay around all day doing nothing like a real dragon."
Spike,Like a real dragon?
Sludge,Sure! I'm not surprised you don't know any better. Twilight basically raised you as a pony. You're barely a dragon at all.
Spike,Huh?
Twilight Sparkle,"Hey, Spike! How are things going with Sludge?"
Spike,"Honestly, I thought having him around would make me feel more dragonish. But I kind of feel less."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could help."
Sludge,"Awww, shucks. [chewing noisily] I guess I shouldn't have said anything about you being more pony than dragon. I just wish we had more in common."
Twilight Sparkle,"Maybe you two can come up with ways to turn up Spike's, uh, dragonishness."
Spike,You think that's something we can do?
Sludge,"You know what, son? I think it is!"
Sludge,"Spike, I'm gonna teach you a thing or two about being a dragon. So, listen up, my boy, because I'm only gonna say this once."
Others,Look at this castle where you live
Spike,"It's pretty sweet, right?"
Sludge,You can't be a dragon here
Spike,"Uh, I can't?"
Sludge,Look at these books up on the wall
Spike,"Hey, I just finished organizing those!"
Sludge,"This treasure pile's not right, I fear"
Others,"Trust me, I got you covered here. You see all this soft pony stuff you're surrounded with? This has got to be the first thing to go."
Others,"Nothin' 'bout this place says ""dragon den"", there's too much fluff All these fancy robes, toss in a pile Take those goblets, dishes, is that gold? Still not enough! De-ponifying might just take a while"
Others,"Sure, this place is grandiose But to a dragon, it's just gross Time we make the lot all disappear Reality you need a dose To all these ponies, you're too close You just can't be a dragon here"
Others,"Good job, my boy! But this is still just the beginning!"
Others,Each and every dragon has a swagger all his own Watch and I'll show you what I mean You can't move like this with so much stuff to weigh you down A dragon always keeps it lean
Others,"Lose this! This! Ooh, this is nice!"
Others,"Your life is soft, your scales are coiffed These pillows, beds, and sheets are washed A delight, but it's just not right what's underneath Every dragon must be free Look at you, then look at me Since when do dragons brush their teeth?"
Others,Ha! Please!
Others,"Sure, this place is grandiose But to a dragon, it's just gross Time we make the lot all disappear"
Spike,What do I do?
Sludge,"Just grab it all and give to me After that, then you'll be free You just can't be a dragon heeeeere!"
Spike,Ha! You're right! I feel better already!
Sludge,"See? What did I tell you? You're very lucky that I found you. Now, go get me some more."
Spike,You got it! I'm gonna go get you all the cushy pony stuff I've got... Dad.
Sludge,Great! Go get 'em... son!
Twilight Sparkle,Spike? I just thought I'd check to see if you and Sludge had any luck turning up your dragonishness. It's hard not to feel like somehow I let you down all these years.
Twilight Sparkle,Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to barge in on ya!
Sludge,"[grunts, sighs] Ah, don't worry about it. Mi castle es su castle."
Twilight Sparkle,"Right. Well, I'll just get out of your way."
Twilight Sparkle,Oh! Spike! I'm so sorry. My morning is not going well. What is all this? Why'd you leave the castle so early?
Spike,I didn't leave. I spent the night outdoors to get in touch with my dragon side.
Twilight Sparkle,Outdoors?
Spike,Yeah! And Sludge asked me to bring him the best breakfast Ponyville has to offer so he can show me how a real dragon would eat it. See you later!
Twilight Sparkle,...And that's why I thought we could use the map to<U+0097>
Spike,"Hey, gang! Dad was just showing me how a real dragon would act in a throne room."
Sludge,"Dragons like to sprawl when they get their claws done. [blows] Now, if you'll all excuse me, it's time for my bath."
Spike,[sighs] Isn't he the best?
Rarity,I'm not sure that's exactly the word I would use.
Sludge,"Uh, Spike? The bath isn't gonna fill itself, son."
Spike,Be right there... Dad.
Twilight Sparkle,I'm glad you're not spending the night outside again.
Spike,"Oh, I am. I'm just looking for a good bedtime story to read to my dad first."
Twilight Sparkle,It's nice that you have somepony to show you dragon culture. But are you sure that's what Sludge is doing?
Spike,What do you mean?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, taking over your room, making a mess of things..."
Spike,[scoffs] That is dragon culture.
Twilight Sparkle,You never acted like that.
Spike,That's because you raised me. Now I finally have a chance to see how I'm supposed to be.
Twilight Sparkle,I don't think you're supposed to be any different than who you are.
Spike,Maybe you just don't like that I have a real parent now.
Twilight Sparkle,That's not true! I'm glad Sludge is here. I-I just wish he wasn't such a<U+0097>
Spike,"Dragon? Of all ponies, I can't believe you would have a problem with that."
Smolder,What happened to you?
Spike,Just sleeping outside like we're meant to. It's not like dragons are supposed to live in castles.
Smolder,I... guess not. But I live in the school. Nothing says we have to live outside.
Spike,"[sighs] I'm so confused. It's been great having Sludge show me how to be a real dragon, but Twilight just doesn't get it."
Smolder,What do you mean?
Spike,"She can't handle how good at being a dragon Sludge is. Maybe someday, I'll be able to lay around doing nothing as well as he does."
Smolder,What?
Spike,"Well, not now, of course. I'm too busy bringing him pony stuff so he can show me what a dragon would do with it."
Smolder,"So, Sludge just lays around while you wait on him claw and tail? Uh, dragons are rude and rebellious, but they aren't lazy lumps who take advantage of their kids."
Spike,Huh. Now I'm really confused.
Smolder,"Me, too. Why don't you tell me everything Sludge said about being a dragon?"
Sludge,"[chewing noisily] Hey! What's going on, son?"
Spike,"Twilight doesn't like having real dragons in the castle, so I told her we're moving out."
Sludge,[coughs] You what?!
Smolder,Spike! I found the perfect cave where you two can live! There aren't even any comfortable rocks inside!
Spike,That does sound perfect!
Sludge,"No, it doesn't! I-I-I mean, uh, I'm not sure I fully demonstrated all the ways a dragon would live here."
Spike,"But we're not gonna live here anymore, so it doesn't matter."
Sludge,It matters to me! [stammers] I want to make sure you have all the knowledge you need.
Spike,"But I do. Dad, you've already shared so much. [singing] This bed is much too soft Just take that silk robe off We can't be dragons living here"
Sludge,Stop! I'm not your father!
Spike,What?
Sludge,I just said that to get in on this sweet castle life.
Spike,So... you... pretended to be my dad?
Sludge,"Now-now-now-now-now, don't look at me like that, kid. I did what any dragon would do."
Smolder,No. You didn't.
Sludge,"Hey. I saw an opportunity, and I took it. That's what dragons do."
Smolder,No. It isn't.
Sludge,You know what? I don't need this. I'm out of here! Enjoy lovin' pony town!
Sludge,I'm taking this pillow.
Spike,I can't believe I thought somepony like that could show me how to be anything.
Smolder,Uh... it must be hard growing up not really knowing who you are.
Spike,That's the thing. I know exactly who I am. And how I got that way.
Spike,"Um, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,Oh. Hi. Where's your father?
Spike,He's gone. Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all. He also wasn't my real dad.
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, Spike. I'm so sorry."
Spike,"I'm the one who's sorry. You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper. Sludge was just a great big phony."
Twilight Sparkle,"I have to say, I'm not surprised. There's no way a dragon like that was related to you. But if you still want to search for your real family, I'd understand if you spent more time in the Dragon Lands."
Spike,I don't think so. I already know who my real family is.
Twilight Sparkle,"Aww! It's me, right?"
Spike,"Mm-hmm! Besides, there's no way I'm living without pillows."
Cozy Glow,Thank you for the mail delivery. Have a wonderful day!
Cozy Glow,"You're new here, right? I'm Cozy Glow, Professor Sparkle's friendship assistant. Welcome to our school! Your first class is just down that hall."
Cozy Glow,"A seven-letter word for ""teamwork"". Have you tried ""synergy""?"
Silverstream,"That's it! Thanks, Cozy!"
Cozy Glow,What are friends for?
Cozy Glow,"Good morning, Professor Sparkle!"
Cozy Glow,Don't worry. I asked Professor Rainbow Dash to cover for you.
Twilight Sparkle,And she said yes?
Cozy Glow,Uh-huh. I told her how busy you are and how much her loyalty meant to you. I also color-coded your teaching schedule by friendship element and catalogued all the magical artifacts in the school. I hope that's okay.
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay? Cozy, that's amazing! You're like my right-hoof pony! I don't know what I'd do without you."
Cozy Glow,[giggles] It's like you taught me. Helping is what friendship's all about.
Twilight Sparkle,Exactly. And hopefully my class is learning that on their field trip right now.
Cozy Glow,I heard they might do some sightseeing first.
Rainbow Dash,Ta-da! The Pegasus Weather Factory! Every drop of rain or flake of snow from Cloudsdale comes from there.
Rainbow Dash,"I know, right? Hey! The cool stuff's over here!"
Ocellus,Wow! I've never stood on a cloud before!
Starlight Glimmer,"You can't normally. But for our trip, I cast a spell that lets us walk like Pegasi."
Gallus,"Hey, Yona! Come check out this view! Unless you're too scared."
Yona,[teeth chattering] Yona not scared! [screams] Now Yona scared!
Rainbow Dash,Come on! We gotta catch 'em!
Gallus,Gotcha!
Ocellus,"It's okay, Yona! You like flying, remember?"
Yona,"Flying, not falling!"
Starlight Glimmer,I don't understand. It-It's like my spell stopped working. That's... never happened before.
Starlight Glimmer,We have an emergency!
Rainbow Dash,The students dropped out of the sky!
Twilight Sparkle,Slow down. What happened?
Starlight Glimmer,"I cast a spell for our field trip to Cloudsdale, but my magic just failed."
Rainbow Dash,We barely caught everypony in time!
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm glad you're all okay, but I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, Starlight. Maybe you did your spell wrong. Let's take a look."
Twilight Sparkle,I didn't drop that book.
Starlight Glimmer,[sarcastically] Maybe you did your spell wrong?
Rarity,Ow!
Fluttershy,Rarity ran into the door.
Rarity,[sobbing] My magic is go-o-o-one! I even had to use my hooves to coif my tail!
Rainbow Dash,Still think there's nothing to worry about?
Twilight Sparkle,This doesn't make any sense. Magic can't just disappear. Something has to be causing this.
Cozy Glow,"Um, didn't we learn in class about a creature that eats magic? Ter, Tee... Tir-something?"
Fluttershy,[gasps] Tirek!
Rainbow Dash,Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?
Twilight Sparkle,"Spike, what's wrong?"
Spike,"[gagging, belches, sighs] Thanks. I've never had a letter get stuck before. It's from Princess Celestia! We've all been called to an emergency meeting in Canterlot! Look!"
Twilight Sparkle,Pretty sure I know what it's about.
Princess Celestia,"Throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing. Spells going wrong. Potions not working."
Princess Luna,Even raising the moon has become difficult. Are there similar troubles in Ponyville?
Twilight Sparkle,We experienced it first-hoof.
Princess Cadance,"It's the same in my kingdom. The Crystal Heart seems safe for now, but I worry if this continues."
Others,"""Special Delivery"": [panting] Letter for the princess from Star Swirl the Bearded!"
Princess Celestia,Ah! It is even more terrible than we feared! Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
Princess Celestia,"Star Swirl believes the power will drain from our land in three days. First, unicorn magic and spells will fail."
Starlight Glimmer,That's what's happening now.
Princess Celestia,"On the second day, creatures will lose their magic abilities."
Fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, no!"
Princess Celestia,"And finally, magical artifacts will stop working. When the sun sets on the third day, the magic in our world will be gone forever!"
Princess Cadance,But why is this happening now?
Princess Luna,That's the worst part. We have no idea.
Twilight Sparkle,Has anypony checked on Tirek?
Pinkie Pie,"You mean the big, red, scary centaur who eats magic? Why would we wa<U+0097> Ohhhh. Riiiiight."
Princess Celestia,"If he has found some way to escape his prison or work from within it, he could be responsible for this."
Princess Luna,That is the best explanation so far. Somepony should investigate.
Twilight Sparkle,We'll go.
Rarity,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. Not without us, you wo<U+0097> Wait. Did you say ""we""?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I've finally learned that it's okay to count on your friends for help. Um, you do want to come, right?"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, duh!"
Princess Celestia,"Thank you, all. We will search for ways to protect Equestria in your absence."
Princess Luna,"Be careful. Tartarus has changed since you were there. It now holds many dangerous creatures, and you won't be able to rely on your magic."
Applejack,"With her friends by her side, she won't have to."
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay. I left you my lesson plan, all my student files, and my annotated syllabus notes. If anything goes wrong, get Celestia."
Starlight Glimmer,Got it!
Twilight Sparkle,Maybe I should just close the school and send my students home.
Starlight Glimmer,[sighs] Would you go save Equestria already?
Spike,Okay. Cozy packed us all up for a trip to bad guy central.
Cozy Glow,"Don't forget the sandwiches. I marked whose is whose, just in case. [whispering, to Spike] Starlight can't stand mustard."
Starlight Glimmer,"That's so sweet of you, Cozy. But Twilight has asked me to stay here to run the school."
Cozy Glow,Oh. I thought that after what happened last time<U+0097>
Spike,"Once she's survived Discord, anything else is a piece of cake."
Twilight Sparkle,"Plus, she'll have you to help her."
Cozy Glow,"Oh, golly, yes! I promise I'll be the best assistant ever! Come on. We can start working on your substitute headmare plans right now, if you like."
Starlight Glimmer,"Wow. Uh, okay."
Twilight Sparkle,See? Nothing to worry about. Tell me there's nothing to worry about.
Cozy Glow,"Good morning, friendship students! I know we're all sad Professor Sparkle is away. But don't worry, because she left me in charge to do things just the way she would."
Gallus,"Uh, I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare."
Cozy Glow,"She was, but she left me this note. [reading] ""I have to go. Twilight needs my help. I know the school is in good hooves with you, Cozy."" [giggles] Isn't that sweet? We won't let Starlight down, will we?"
Smolder,"It's just kind of weird, isn't it?"
Cozy Glow,I don't know what you mean.
Smolder,"Like, why'd she change her mind? Why did Starlight write a note instead of saying goodbye to us herself? Doesn't make any sense."
Cozy Glow,"[giggles] Oh, Smolder, you forget. We're not scheming dragons. We're ponies. Sounds like somecreature needs to do a little extra friendship homework."
Yona,"Yak not pony either! If Smolder get homework, Yona get homework."
Ocellus,"Me, too!"
Sandbar,I'm in!
Silverstream,Yeah! [laughs] Homework party!
Gallus,[groans] Fine.
Cozy Glow,What loyalty. Professor Rainbow Dash would be so proud. You are such good friends. You all are. And I'm grateful because it will be awfully hard running a whole school alone. Can I count on each of you to help me?
Cozy Glow,"Thank you so much! It's just like our professors taught us. Together, we can get through anything!"
Rarity,Ow! Ugh! I have had it with these horrible flies! [whines] I miss my magic!
Twilight Sparkle,Have you tried using your tail to shoo them away?
Rarity,[gasps] Bite your tongue! It's for decorative purposes only!
Pinkie Pie,Hey! I didn't know we packed green cupcakes.
Fluttershy,"Um, we didn't. They must've gone bad without magic to keep them cold."
Rainbow Dash,"""Magic"" this, ""magic"" that. We don't need magic to go on a little hike."
Rarity,You were saying?
Applejack,"You just need to think more like Earth ponies, y'all. Granny's ""Apple Core No-Bite-No-More""! That'll keep the flies off."
Pinkie Pie,[sniffs] Ugh! It smells just like it looks!
Fluttershy,"Even if our food's spoiled, these blueberries are still good to eat."
Spike,Too bad we can't do anything about the rainstorm.
Rainbow Dash,"I can't stop that storm by myself, but I can still help!"
Twilight Sparkle,I think we have all the magic we need right here. Not that I don't want to get it back. Heh. Let's go!
Others,"""Citrine Spark"": Cozy Glow baked our class cupcakes today!"
Others,S08E01 Unnamed Earth Mare # And she made all of us friendship bracelets!
Others,"""Patty Peppermint"": She's the nicest pony I've ever met. I'm so glad she's headmare!"
Sandbar,"Uh, temporary headmare? Right, guys?"
Others,"""Citrine Spark"": Oh, oh, of course. But if Twilight takes her time coming back, I won't mind."
Silverstream,Finally! We thought you forgot about study club.
Sandbar,Sorry I'm late. Cozy Glow gave our class tickets to a Sapphire Shores concert in Ponyville tonight.
Gallus,You get the feeling Cozy's trying too hard to make us like her?
Ocellus,Or maybe she just wants to help us keep our minds off of how scary it is that magic's disappearing.
Smolder,I don't trust her. What's she up to behind those big eyes and bouncy curls?
Yona,And why Cozy pony coming out of catacombs so late at night?
Gallus,Let's go ask her.
Twilight Sparkle,"This is the only door to Tartarus. The good news is the seal isn't broken, so we know Tirek didn't escape."
Applejack,"Let me guess. You got bad news, too?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Last time I was here, I had to use magic to get in. And according to Star Swirl, all unicorn magic was gone by yesterday's sunset."
Rainbow Dash,Maybe he was wrong.
Pinkie Pie,"Don't worry, Twilight. I got this."
Pinkie Pie,Free pizza delivery!
Pinkie Pie,"Huh. Always worked before. Oh, well."
Applejack,Did any of y'all pack somethin' that could actually help?
Rarity,"These all do magic, but not the kind we're looking for, I'm afraid."
Spike,How about this?
Twilight Sparkle,"The Key of Unfettered Entrance! Where did you find this, Spike?"
Spike,In your bag. Cozy Glow must've packed it for you.
Twilight Sparkle,She really did think of everything.
Fluttershy,"Um, what does it do?"
Twilight Sparkle,It can magically open any door. And since artifacts like this haven't lost their power yet...
Twilight Sparkle,I guess it only works once.
Applejack,Cockatrice!
Rarity,"Do something, Fluttershy!"
Rainbow Dash,Don't look at it! It'll turn you to stone!
Pinkie Pie,I don't feel like stone.
Pinkie Pie,Unless it's really bouncy stone.
Fluttershy,"I think he lost his magic, too. All the creatures here must have."
Twilight Sparkle,Star Swirl said that would happen on the second day.
Spike,"I know it should make me feel safer, but it just makes me sad. We gotta fix this!"
Chancellor Neighsay,Where is Princess Twilight?!
Cozy Glow,"Oh, golly. She's away on a quest. I'm watching the school for her."
Chancellor Neighsay,"Magic is failing across our land, and she left a foal in charge of this facility?"
Cozy Glow,"Yes, sir! Is there anything I can do for you?"
Chancellor Neighsay,"That won't be necessary. Twilight's folly stops here. As of now, I am headstallion. And I have quite a few changes to make."
Pinkie Pie,"If all these monsters lost their magic, then getting past Cerberus should be easy-peasy!"
Rainbow Dash,Look out!
Fluttershy,I'll talk to him.
Fluttershy,"Um, excuse me, puppy?"
Fluttershy,"You're a very good guard dog. Yes, you are. But, um, we were wondering if we could get by to check on Tirek."
Applejack,That looks like a yes.
Rarity,"I'll get you a towel, darling."
Lord Tirek,The Princess of Friendship here for a visit. What have I done to earn the honor of your company?
Twilight Sparkle,"We want answers, Tirek. Magic is disappearing from Equestria."
Lord Tirek,"I know. What a waste of such... [slurping] ...mmmm, delicious power."
Rainbow Dash,So you are behind this!
Lord Tirek,"Silly filly, if I had all of that magic, you think I'd still be locked up in here? But I might know something about it..."
Cozy Glow,What are you doing?! Those are Twilight's student files!
Chancellor Neighsay,"These aren't. Not anymore. With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together. Twilight has endangered us all by skipping off on friendship trips while these dangerous creatures run loose."
Cozy Glow,"You don't think they're the reason magic is disappearing, do you?"
Chancellor Neighsay,"Yes, and I came to warn Twilight. But since she is gone, it falls to me to protect you foals from these monsters."
Chancellor Neighsay,Did you hear something?
Cozy Glow,It sounded like it came from over there!
Chancellor Neighsay,You again. As I suspected.
Chancellor Neighsay,"From now on, this school is pony-only! As nature intended."
Chancellor Neighsay,"Since you refuse to explain your plot against Equestria and return the magic you stole, you will stay here while I summon your guardians to take you home."
Sandbar,"Wait! You were right about them from the beginning, Chancellor. I see that now."
Smolder,What are you saying?!
Silverstream,Sandbar?!
Sandbar,I don't want anything to do with creatures that could threaten Equestria!
Chancellor Neighsay,"Wisely put, colt."
Chancellor Neighsay,Everypony will come to their senses eventually.
Apple Bloom,What in tarnation?!
Sandbar,Sorry. I ran out of apples. I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble. Chancellor Neighsay locked them up.
Apple Bloom,Huh? I thought Cozy Glow was in charge.
Sandbar,"Not anymore. But you guys are good buddies. If you can convince her to distract Neighsay, I can break out my friends. Will you help me?"
Apple Bloom,Do mulberries have seeds?
Apple Bloom,That's a yes.
Twilight Sparkle,"Where is Equestria's magic going, Tirek? What's making it disappear?"
Lord Tirek,"If you let me out, I'm sure it will jog my memory. What do you say? I scratch your back, you scratch mine?"
Rainbow Dash,"How about you tell us what you know or you'll be stuck here forever, because we're out of magic keys and nopony can open the door?"
Rarity,"Oh, dear. I hadn't thought of that."
Spike,We're just as trapped as Tirek?
Lord Tirek,"[chuckles] What a pity. Well, for you. Sweet revenge for me. It seems my little prot<e9>g<e9>'s plan worked after all."
Applejack,Which little prot<e9>g<e9>?
Lord Tirek,"Oh, we've never met. We're pen pals. Each letter had so many questions about draining magic."
Pinkie Pie,And you answered them?!
Lord Tirek,I was bored. So I simply pointed my pen pal in the right direction.
Fluttershy,"Can't you just tell us your pen pal's name? I mean, since we're stuck here anyway?"
Lord Tirek,"Oh, why not? The irony is too perfect. Her name is..."
Sandbar,Cozy Glow! I-I could've sworn I saw her come down this way when she left her office.
Cozy Glow,"Enjoying yourself in there, Starlight? I'm sorry I had to push you in. But what else could I do? You were going to ruin all my plans."
Princess Celestia,Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
Cozy Glow,Didn't we learn about a creature that eats magic?
Princess Luna,Somepony should investigate.
Twilight Sparkle,We'll go.
Gallus,I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare.
Chancellor Neighsay,"With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together."
Sandbar,I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble.
Lord Tirek,It seems my little prot<e9>g<e9>'s plan worked after all.
Twilight Sparkle,Cozy Glow is behind all of this?!
Spike,"Um, there's seven of us."
Twilight Sparkle,I knew we shouldn't have left!
Applejack,"But Starlight's in charge at the school. If anypony can stop Cozy Glow, it's her."
Twilight Sparkle,We have to get out of here. Her students can't handle Cozy on their own.
Rarity,Not everything can be solved with brute force. We need magic to escape.
Pinkie Pie,"Maybe there's a way to get out without magic. Like a secret lever or a secret button or a secret admirer who knows a secret about you but is all, ""Your secret's safe with me because I put it in Tartarus and I have a key!"""
Twilight Sparkle,"I'm afraid not. The most powerful villains and monsters of all time are trapped here. And without our magic, so are we."
Twilight Sparkle,"Unless... These creatures might be losing their magical powers, but there's still a magic that makes up what they are. Maybe we can borrow some of that."
Cozy Glow,"Uh, excuse me? Um, Chancellor Neighsay?"
Chancellor Neighsay,You might as well get used to calling me Headstallion Neighsay. I plan to be here for quite some time.
Cozy Glow,"Gee, it sure is a relief to have somepony in charge, what with the magical crisis going on. And we're all so grateful to you for taking care of those... non-ponies. But doesn't the EEA need you?"
Chancellor Neighsay,What the EEA needs is somepony to protect this school from the threats at Equestria's borders instead of gallivanting off on adventures beyond them.
Cozy Glow,Twilight didn't just run off willy-nilly. She left me in charge. I'm her right-hoof mare!
Chancellor Neighsay,"Another in a long list of mistakes the Princess of Friendship has made. Rest assured, from now on, this school shall be run according to strict EEA guidelines."
Chancellor Neighsay,The way it always should've been.
Cozy Glow,"Well, that sounds just peachy<U+0097>"
Cozy Glow,...Headstallion Neighsay.
Sweetie Belle,Cozy Glow did all of this? How? Why?
Apple Bloom,"I don't know. But come on, y'all. We gotta get Starlight out of there before she comes back."
Sandbar,Wait!
Scootaloo,Sweetie Belle!
Sweetie Belle,Help!
Apple Bloom,That's gotta be what's suckin' up all the magic in Equestria.
Sandbar,"But if that's true, then Twilight and the others went to Tartarus for nothing. And if all of Equestria's magic's getting sucked up in there, there's no way for them to get back!"
Scootaloo,We need to get help!
Sweetie Belle,"But Starlight's trapped here, and there's no way to get word to Celestia or anypony else!"
Apple Bloom,I guess we're on our own.
Smolder,"Still locked, huh?"
Gallus,We gotta at least try to get out.
Ocellus,"Why? If Sandbar's turned his back on us, every other pony probably has, too."
Yona,Sandbar not turn his back! Sandbar is our friend!
Smolder,"Uh, did you miss the part where he said he didn't want anything to do with us?"
Silverstream,Maybe he just said that so one of us could be free to snoop around and figure out what's going on.
Sandbar,I dunno. That sounds too clever for a pony to come up with.
Yona,"[gasps, laughs] Yona knew Sandbar was still our friend!"
Sweetie Belle,We all are.
Scootaloo,Except for Cozy Glow. That pony is not who we thought she was.
Apple Bloom,She's the one draining magic out of Equestria!
Young Six sans Sandbar,What?!
Sandbar,"We'll explain on the way. But right now, we gotta get to get to Chancellor Neighsay."
Gallus,Huh?
Sandbar,"I know he doesn't like non-ponies. But if we tell him what's going on, he'll help."
Chancellor Neighsay,"I am sure you are all concerned about the magic situation. But I want to assure you that this institution is safe, despite the absence of your headmare. As your new headstallion, let me be the first to say that the reign of Princess Twilight is over! From now on, this school will adhere to EEA doctrine, as it should have from the start!"
Cozy Glow,"[claps] Thank you, Chancellor Neighsay, for that rousing speech. I know you're a stallion who truly believes what you say. And when you say this school will be run according to EEA doctrine, I know you mean it. And when you say there won't be any more lessons from the Princess of Friendship at the School of Friendship, I guess you mean that, too."
Chancellor Neighsay,That's not exactly what<U+0097>
Cozy Glow,"But Twilight decided to run her school outside of the EEA guidelines. And even though you tried to stop her, Princesses Celestia and Luna trusted her enough to support her."
Chancellor Neighsay,"Well, I-I wouldn't say that<U+0097>"
Cozy Glow,"So, since I know you mean what you say, my question is really for the students. Are we going to give the pony who already tried to wreck Twilight's school once another chance to do it?"
Cozy Glow,I guess things will have to stay the way Twilight wants them. Which includes leaving me in charge.
Chancellor Neighsay,This<U+0097>! I can<U+0097>! Just<U+0097>!
Sandbar,Okay. So maybe we need a new plan.
Cozy Glow,"Oh, oh, not too tight. We don't want to hurt the Chancellor."
Cozy Glow,"I'm sure Twilight will know what to do with him when she gets back. Now, back to class, everyone. We let the EEA disrupt our friendship studies long enough."
Chancellor Neighsay,[grunting] Why are you doing this? I thought you wanted to have somepony in charge of the school.
Cozy Glow,"Oh, I do. You just aren't the pony I had in mind."
Scootaloo,"Hey, Cozy Glow! What's so funny?"
Sweetie Belle,Are you just happy to be running the school?
Cozy Glow,"Oh, I'm just keeping Twilight's seat warm."
Apple Bloom,"Still, it's pretty impressive."
Sweetie Belle,Is there anything we can do to help?
Scootaloo,We can hang out with you all day if you want.
Cozy Glow,"You know, there is something I need help with."
Chancellor Neighsay,"Oh, wonderful. I suppose you've all come to gloat?"
Silverstream,"Actually, we've come to undo all these chains and free you!"
Chancellor Neighsay,But... But why?
Yona,"Now that nasty pony met even nastier pony, maybe nasty pony not be so nasty."
Sandbar,"Also, we'd kind of like to stop Cozy before she drains all the magic from Equestria."
Chancellor Neighsay,She's behind that as well? I must get word to Celestia and Luna.
Sandbar,"How? Without magic, it'll take forever to get to them."
Chancellor Neighsay,"While it's true that unicorns have lost their ability to cast spells, the most potent magic in Equestria is housed in our... artifacts. The EEA medallion allows me to travel throughout Equestria. Its magic worked when I chained you up. Perhaps it still has enough to send me to the princesses."
Ocellus,I hope he makes it.
Smolder,I hope he doesn't come back and lock us up again.
Gallus,If he comes back.
Silverstream,Everything's gonna be fine! Twilight and the others are probably already on their way!
Fluttershy,"Um, are you sure there's magic in Cerberus? Clarissa the pig has two tails, and while her singing voice is lovely, I don't think it's magical."
Twilight Sparkle,We need to try everything if we want to get out of here.
Pinkie Pie,I don't know. Tartarus isn't so bad. I could hang out here for a while!
Pinkie Pie,Eh. Maybe not forever though.
Lord Tirek,"But that is just what it will be! If my prot<e9>g<e9> has followed my instructions, by sunset tonight, every last vestige of Equestrian magic will disappear into the ether forever!"
Twilight Sparkle,Have you even thought about what losing magic would mean?
Lord Tirek,It means the six of you will be trapped here! Like me!
Spike,Seven!
Twilight Sparkle,Exactly. It means you're trapped here. Forever. With us.
Lord Tirek,Uhhhh... I hadn't thought of it like that.
Spike,"So, what do we do, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Dash and Applejack nearly have Cerberus tired out. If Rarity pitches in, I think they can get him to sit still long enough to try what I have in mind."
Fluttershy,"I'm sure I can get the other monsters to help. [whispering, to Spike] Besides, I would never call them monsters."
Spike,"What about Tirek? He's probably got some magic, too, right?"
Pinkie Pie,Leave him to me.
Rarity,[to Cerberus] Down!
Fluttershy,"Okay, everyone! Time to show Equestria that you aren't monsters! You're wonderful, mystical creatures!"
Pinkie Pie,"I know it's not your birthday, so You get a party, even though We'll sing and dance from one to ten And then we'll do it all again!"
blows,"More tea, Princess Pudding Rock? [high-pitched voice] ""Oh! Don't mind if I do!"" [laughs] I can do this all eternity."
Lord Tirek,Fine! I'll help you leave! Just please stop!
Pinkie Pie,Tirek's in!
Apple Bloom,It's just so excitin' to have a foal our age runnin' things. We should have an ice cream social every day!
Cozy Glow,"That's a splendid idea, Apple Bloom. But to tell you the truth, the thing I need help with most is cleaning."
Sweetie Belle,Say no more. Just take us around the school and show us everything you want cleaned.
Cozy Glow,"Well, actually, you could start right in here."
Scootaloo,It looks pretty clean already.
Cozy Glow,Do you three think you can fool me?! I know a diversion when I see it!
Yona,"Uh, why pony lead us back down here?"
Sandbar,"We obviously can't handle Cozy on our own. But we can't just sit around and wait for help. So, there's one more prisoner I think we should free."
Silverstream,Ooh! I guess Starlight! Is it Starlight?
Yona,"Counselor pony, come out! We need help with nasty pony!"
Sandbar,She can't talk to us from in there. We'll have to figure a way to get her out.
Gallus,"Hey! This is just like chapter twelve in ""Kanthaka's Facts and Artifacts"" from Twilight's class!"
Gallus,"What? I've been studying. Finals are coming up, you know?"
Ocellus,"Actually, I remember that, too! Cozy must've linked these artifacts to act like a mystical magnet, attracting all the magic in Equestria into that orb."
Smolder,"So, we can shut it down by yanking one of these things out, right?"
Ocellus,"Sure, though that would probably cause a magical feedback loop and destroy the whole school!"
Cozy Glow,"Destroy the School of Friendship?! Oh, dear! Chancellor Neighsay was wrong about a lot of things, but I guess he was right about all of you!"
Twilight Sparkle,All right. Is everypony ready?
Rarity,[to Cerberus] Sit! Good! [to Twilight Sparkle] I can't say for how much longer.
Pinkie Pie,All eternity!
Lord Tirek,"Yes, by all means, please! Just get on with it!"
Pinkie Pie,"There's your cue, you evil centaur, you."
Twilight Sparkle,That's it! I think it's working!
Twilight Sparkle,Come on! I don't know how long I can hold it!
Rainbow Dash,[to Cerberus] Good boy!
Fluttershy,"[to creatures] Bye, friends. Hopefully, we'll be able to turn you all back into your normal, wonderful selves soon."
Pinkie Pie,"[to Lord Tirek] Thanks for the assist, your redness!"
Pinkie Pie,Yay! Twilight did it!
Twilight Sparkle,I couldn't have done it without all your help.
Rarity,I'm not sure we did!
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Applejack,Tirek said all of Equestria's magic would be gone at sunset.
Twilight Sparkle,"Without magic, there's no way we'll get back to the school in time!"
Fluttershy,What does that mean?
Twilight Sparkle,It means... we've failed!
Cozy Glow,"After everything Twilight's done for you, why would you want to destroy her school?"
Gallus,We don't! You're the one using these artifacts to drain magic from Equestria!
Cozy Glow,Me?! We all just saw you with your claws all over them! [gasps] It all makes sense. These creatures want magic gone from Equestria because it's the only thing ponies have that they don't!
Ocellus,"Technically, there's a magical component when Silverstream and I transform."
Yona,And Yona's friends' friendship is magic! Twilight said!
Cozy Glow,And you repay her by sending her to Tartarus on a wild goose chase so you could destroy everything she built! [gasps] They've even trapped Starlight in that-that thing! We have to defend this school!
Sandbar,"No! No, don't listen to her!"
Smolder,Gallus!
Others,"""Citrine Spark"": They just sacrificed themselves trying to save their friend. Professor Dash always said there's nothing more loyal than that. Shouldn't we try to save them?"
Cozy Glow,They brought this on themselves. There's nothing we can do.
Others,S08E01 Unnamed Earth Mare # That doesn't seem very generous. Or kind.
Cozy Glow,"Yeah, yeah. The Elements of Harmony are very important. They're just not applicable in every circumstance. And with magic gone from Equestria, I'm not even sure the Tree of Harmony will be as helpful as it once was."
Cozy Glow,What's happening?!
Others,S08E01 Unnamed Earth Mare # They're glowing like the Elements! I think the Tree of Harmony saved them!
Gallus,Guess our friendship is pretty magical after all.
Ocellus,Hurry! Grab the artifacts!
Silverstream,"Um, didn't you say that could destroy the school?"
Ocellus,"But if we don't try, we could lose magic forever!"
Sandbar,You all better get clear!
Cozy Glow,Wait! Where are you going?! Stoooooop!
Yona,[laughs] Counselor pony<U+0097>!
Starlight Glimmer,"Uh, it's nice to see you, too."
Ocellus,I guess magic is back.
Cozy Glow,You've ruined everything! Now Twilight and her ridiculous friends can escape from Tartarus!
Cozy Glow,I mean... Yay! All my friends are safe!
Applejack,"You can drop the act, Cozy Glow! Your pen pal Tirek told us all about how he helped you suck up all that magic!"
Twilight Sparkle,But I still don't understand why.
Cozy Glow,"[growls] Why?! Because friendship is power! You might be the Princess of Friendship, but as headmare of this school, I can collect even more friends than you!"
Twilight Sparkle,"You're the one who doesn't get it, Cozy. Friendship is powerful, but power isn't why you make friends. I'm sorry I couldn't teach you that."
Gallus,"Well, you taught us."
Silverstream,You can't let one bad apple make you think you failed.
Sandbar,And we never could've stopped her if we hadn't learned what you taught us about friendship.
Cozy Glow,"Honesty? Loyalty? Generosity? Blah-blah-blah! I can make more friends without using any of them! And if I can't do it here, I'll do it somewhere else!"
Others,"""Patty Peppermint"": Yeah... I don't think so!"
Chancellor Neighsay,"[sighs] I'm glad you're back in charge of the School of Friendship, Princess."
Chancellor Neighsay,It's clear to me now that there is nopony better suited for the job.
Twilight Sparkle,What's going on?
Silverstream,"Hi, Headmare Twilight! We're just practicing for graduation!"
Twilight Sparkle,Graduation?
Gallus,"Now that we've saved Equestria, we figure we're done with school."
Twilight Sparkle,"Saving Equestria is nice, but I'm afraid it'll take more than one semester to learn all there is to know about friendship."
Spike,[belches] Told ya.
Young Six,Awwww...
Chancellor Neighsay,Your headmare is right. I thought friendship was something only ponies should share with each other. But you all taught me how wrong I was. I suppose true friendship can take a lifetime to understand.
Twilight Sparkle,"If it were easy to learn, we wouldn't need a school."
Apple Bloom,[yelps] We held her off as long as we could!
Scootaloo,But she locked us in this closet!
Sweetie Belle,What happened?! Is everything all right?! Where's Cozy Glow?!
Twilight Sparkle,Everything worked out just fine.
Princess Celestia,"As for Cozy Glow, I can assure you <U+0097> where she's going, she won't be causing any more trouble."
Lord Tirek,Of course it's boring here now! But at least you're not in a cage!
Cozy Glow,"Hey, neighbor. Wanna be friends?"
Rachel Platten,Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Others,"See the ponies trottin' down the street Equestria is where they wanna meet They all know where they wanna go And they're trottin' in time And they're trottin', yeah"
Others,"They got the beat They got the beat They got the beat Yeah, they got the beat"
Others,"Go-go music really makes us dance Do the pony, puts us in a trance Do the watusi, just give us a chance That's when we fall in line"
Others,"'Cause we got the beat We got the beat We got the beat Yeah, we got it!"
Spike,'Scuse me! Dragon on the move! Important princess documents comin' through!
Others,S04E26 Unnamed Earth Mare # Whoa! Everypony from Manehattan to Saddle Arabia is here!
Apple Cobbler,"I know, filly! We almost couldn't book a stable!"
Clear Skies,Princess Twilight must have her hooves full with this giant Festival!
Female Pony 2,Are you kidding?! She's smart and organized and cool under pressure! There's nothing she can't handle!
Twilight Sparkle,"Ommmmm... Ohhhhhhh mmmmy goodness, I can't handle this! Ooh! Nothing is working! I just have to get it together! Just go in there! And ask! This is your Friendship Festival! Everypony's happiness rests in your hooves. [facehoofs] Ohhhh!"
Spike,"Okay, Twilight. Got all your charts and graphs."
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, thank goodness you're here, Spike! I'm just so nervous about this meeting!"
Spike,Whachoo talkin' 'bout?
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] I'm about to ask the three most royal princesses of Equestria for a huge favor! What if they reject me?
Spike,It'll be fine. Just remember the most important thing.
Twilight Sparkle,Smile?!
Spike,"Eh... no. You're a Princess, too."
Twilight Sparkle,"Right! [exhales] Good morning, Princesses. Thank you all for seeing me. I have an idea that I think will make our Friendship Festival the most wonderful celebration Equestria has ever seen!"
Princess Celestia,"Yes, Twilight! We are very excited!"
Princess Cadance,Ponies have been arriving from all over all morning.
Princess Luna,"I'd like to think it's to see us, but Songbird Serenade might be the bigger attraction."
Twilight Sparkle,"Yes, she is the... ""mane"" event! [giggles] And to make it extra special, I could use your help. Spike?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Songbird Serenade's performance is not scheduled to start until after you begin the sunset. And based on my precise calculation, to get the very best lighting for the stage, Princess Celestia, I was hoping you could make sure the sun stays about 28.1<U+00BA> to the south, and, Princess Luna, if you could raise the moon 62<U+00BA> to the north at the same time, it would reflect the sunlight on the other side and really frame the entire stage perfectly!"
Princess Luna,I...
Twilight Sparkle,"But wait! There's more! Cadance, if you could use your crystal magic to create an aurora above the stage, the sun and the moon will shine through it and create a truly amazing light show!"
Spike,"Presenting Songbird Serenade! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Whoa-ho!"
Others,Whoa!
Spike,[weakly] Ta-da...
Princess Luna,So you're saying you want us to move the sun and the moon for the party.
Princess Celestia,"Twilight, each of us uses our powers to serve Equestria in our own way. You are the Princess of Friendship. You already have all the magic you need."
Twilight Sparkle,So... that'd be a no?
Rainbow Dash,Yes!
Rainbow Dash,Sky's cleared and ready for the festival!
Pinkie Pie,Whoa!
Pinkie Pie,"Whoa! Heads up, Fluttershy! Out of control balloooooon!!"
Fluttershy,"Hoo. I don't think it's the balloon that's out of control, Pinkie Pie!"
Applejack,"Hey, y'all!"
Applejack,Anypony up for some free samples of my family's apple cider?
Rainbow Dash,Ah! Thank you! Loved it!
Applejack,"Wow, Rarity. It's a fine job you're doin' there. 'Course it might not get done 'til after the concert."
Rarity,"Applejack, darling, anypony can do ""fine"". Twilight asked me, so clearly, she's going for fabulous, and fabulous takes time."
Rainbow Dash,"Fabulous takes forever! But ""awesome""..."
Fluttershy,Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,...can get done in four seconds flat! Faster if I do my sonic rainboom!
Rarity,"Aah! Nono, oh no! Don't you dare, Rainbow Dash! It looks wretched enough already."
Rainbow Dash,"Oh come on, it's fine!"
Rarity,"If you were raised in a barn! Ahem, no offense, Applejack."
Applejack,None taken. Especially since I wasn't raised in a barn. My family just happens to have a barn. Where I was born. And... spent most of my formative years...
Rainbow Dash,[very quickly] Raised in a barn!
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, just two hundred and eighteen things left to do and we're ready."
Others,"Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Hey, Twilight!"
Rarity,"Hello, Spike."
Spike,"Uh, hi, Rarity. Heh heh."
Applejack,How'd it go with the other Princesses? They like your idea?
Pinkie Pie,I bet they loved it!
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] Not exactly. They think I can make today perfect without their magic.
Rarity,"And they are absolutely right, darling. This festival is your brilliant idea and we know you're up to the task!"
Twilight Sparkle,"But what if I'm not?! What if Songbird Serenade hates the stage?! Or nopony makes a new friend?! And if I fail at the festival, then who am I?!"

Pinkie Pie,Oopsie! Guess my easy bake confetti cake cannon needs a little bit more fine tuning!
Twilight Sparkle,[nickers] Hmmm...
Code Red,"Songbird Serenade? Is it really her? It is, it is!"
Songbird Serenade,Hiya. I'm lookin' for the pony in charge?
Songbird Serenade,I need to set up for my sound check.
Twilight Sparkle,"Ms. Songbird Serenade? Um, I was just going to check on you. [laughs nervously] I'm Princess Twilight, and sorry about the mess. I'm usually not so..."
Female pony,Oh! How embarrassing!
Songbird Serenade,Caked in cake?
Twilight Sparkle,Heh heh.
Vinny,You have visual on buttercream?
Whinnyfield,Visual confirmed. Go for cleanup.
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Storm clouds? I ordered perfect weather! Rainbow Dash?!
Rainbow Dash,Uh... I... don't think those are storm clouds.
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! I bet those are the clowns I ordered!
Pinkie Pie,...Or definitely not the clowns I ordered.
Party Favor,"Brian, no!"
Grubber,"[clears throat, voice echoing] Ponieth of Equethtria, we come on behalf of the fearsome, the powerful, the almighty...Thtorm King!"
Female pony,This is terrible!
Grubber,"And now, to deliver the evil, evil methage, put your hooveth together for Commander Tempeeeetht!"
Twilight Sparkle,Is that a... unicorn?
Spike,"I think so, but what happened to her horn?"
Princess Celestia,"""Tempest"" is it? How may we help you?"
Tempest Shadow,"Oh, I'm so glad you asked. How about we start with your complete and total surrender?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Hi there. Princess of Friendship. Not exactly sure what's going on, but I know we can talk things out."
Tempest Shadow,"Oh, goody. All four Princesses. Here's the deal, ladies. I need your magic. Give it up nicely, please, or we make it difficult for everyone!"
Princess Luna,And why should we cower before you? There's one of you and hundreds of us.
Tempest Shadow,"[chuckles] I was hoping you'd choose ""difficult""."
Princess Celestia,Cadance!
Princess Cadance,[gasps] I can't... stop it!
Princess Celestia,"Luna, quick! Go south beyond the Badlands!"
Princess Luna,Hmph!
Twilight Sparkle,Luna!
Rainbow Dash,Twilight!
Tempest Shadow,[chuckles] Easy as pie.
Grubber,"Oh, I love pie. Oh, you totally got the latht Printheth!"
Tempest Shadow,"That's not the Princess! Grubber, get her now!"
Grubber,"Guyth, we gotta get the Princess!"
Applejack,"Over here, y'all!"
Twilight Sparkle,Come on!
Grubber,Which one of you guyth ith goin' down there?
Grubber,"[sighs] I would, but I jutht had a hearty meal, and I will think and I will thide-cramp. I'm very big-boned. I think quick."
Applejack,Everypony okay?
Rarity,I think my bottom's on backward.
Pinkie Pie,We just got our cupcakes handed to us by the worst party crasher ever!
Rainbow Dash,We gotta go back there and fight!
Spike,"Well, you saw the size of those goons. You seriously wanna go back?"
Applejack,"So now what? We can't hide here forever. And let's be honest, we can't go back. Look at what they did to the Princesses. We gotta keep them from Twilight."
Twilight Sparkle,The Queen.
Pinkie Pie,"Yeah, the Queen! Uh, what queen?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Celestia told Luna to find the Queen of the... ""Hippos"". Luna can't, so I have to."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, hippos? Seriously?"
Pinkie Pie,"I've heard they're surprisingly graceful for their size. Huh, but they're always hungry."
Spike,Hungry?
Applejack,Hippos?
Twilight Sparkle,"They're somewhere south, past the Badlands."
Fluttershy,That means we'll have to... leave Equestria. Oh!
Rarity,I'm not even packed!
Twilight Sparkle,"I understand you're scared, and nopony else has to go. But I have to find this queen. She might be our only hope."
Rainbow Dash,"Well, you're not getting all the glory. We're in this together."
Applejack,We got your back.
Pinkie Pie,Indeedy!
Rarity,I am ready to save Equestria!
Fluttershy,Yay.
Spike,"We're all behind you, Twilight."
Pinkie Pie,Let's go find this hippo!
Spike,"Uh, south?"
Pinkie Pie,"Hehe! Whee! [giggles] Whee! Boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy! Anypony up for a game of ""I Spy""?"
Tempest Shadow,All this power wasted on parties when there are far greater uses.
Tempest Shadow,Well? Answer it!
The Storm King,Where am I supposed to be looking? I never understand how this spell works. Tempest!
Tempest Shadow,"Over here, Your Excellency."
The Storm King,Where?
Tempest Shadow,Over here.
The Storm King,Huh?
Tempest Shadow,"No. No, right. Look right."
The Storm King,My right?
Tempest Shadow,Yep.
The Storm King,"Oh. There you are. Here's the deal. I'm in the middle of a big re-brand here. ""The Storm King"" is tracking well as ""intensely intimidating"", but you know what? I need to back it up. You know what I need to back it up with? A storm! That would be great! You promised me magic that could control the elements, and right now, I'm holding a what? A branch. A twig. Bleh!"
Tempest Shadow,"Uh, that would be the Staff of Sacanas, Your Excellency, and it will..."
The Storm King,Mm-hmm?
Tempest Shadow,...channel the magic of the four rulers of this land.
The Storm King,Mm-hmmmm?
Tempest Shadow,You'll soon have the power of a hundred armies.
The Storm King,"So that would be a yes on your locking down the four Pegacornicuseses, or whatever you call them?"
Tempest Shadow,Give me three days. I'll have everything ready for your arrival.
The Storm King,"[ominous] Remember, Tempest. Only I have the power to make you whole. Make this twig work, and you'll get your reward. Fail me, and your horn won't be the only thing that's broken."
Tempest Shadow,It won't be a problem.
The Storm King,"[upbeat] Great! [warbling] I'm ready to power up, crash and bash, and be the biggest, baddest bugaloooooo..."
Grubber,"Thorry, bad thpell thervice. You want me to call him back?"
Tempest Shadow,Do you have the Princess?
Grubber,"Well, uh, funny thtory. It kinda theemth like she... she might've like, you know, got away... a little bit. I know you're dithappointed, but I got one word for you: ""thpongecake""."
Tempest Shadow,I need all four for the staff to work.
Grubber,"Hey, I know! I want the Thtorm King to fix that crazy horn as badly as you do. It lookth like a crackly chipped tooth on the top of your head. And you know you don't look good in hatth."
Tempest Shadow,That Princess is not gonna keep me from getting my horn back! Prepare my ship!
Grubber,Ihhh!
Tempest Shadow,Please. How far could one little pony get on her own?
Spike,"We could be going in... circles! Endless... sand... [inhales] Nothin' for miles... but sand... [breathes] and this rock... [coughs] and this cactus... [breathes] and this roooooooooaaaaaad.... [breathes, faints, breathes] ...this rooooooad...."
Spike,Whoa!
Rainbow Dash,Cool!
Applejack,What is that?
Pinkie Pie,"Oooh! A city! [scoffs] We are doing it, you guys!"
Rarity,"You know what they say: where there's a city, there's a spa!"
Rainbow Dash,Who says that?
Applejack,"'Case you forgot, we're on a mission to save Equestria."
Rarity,I can multitask.
Pig Creature 1,"Don't worry, little one, we'll let ya go!"
Pig Creature 2,To the highest bidder!
Pig Creature 1,Nice!
Vendor 1,Storm King bobbleheads!
Vendor 2,"Ooh. Hey! You with the horn, you selling?"
Fluttershy,Oh...
Fluttershy,Ooh!
Twilight Sparkle,"Hi there! Ooh, I'm sorry. Here. Lemme help you with that."
Pushkin,Hey! No magic around my merchandise!
Capper,Hmmm... Very interesting...
Twilight Sparkle,Okay. We just gotta stick together. Be careful who you talk to. And try to blend in.
Pinkie Pie,Can I have your attention please?!
Pinkie Pie,Can anypony take us to the Queen of the Hippos?!
Mori,You want something? You gotta give something!
Pinkie Pie,"Well, how about a big warm hug from a grateful pony friend?"
Pinkie Pie,"How about this comb that I've never used? A picture of my sister Maud? This breath mint? Seriously, buddy. Help me help you."
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, you can't just take off! [through clenched teeth] And you don't need to announce to every..."
Pinkie Pie,"Relax, Twilight! I totally got this!"
Louise,How much for the giant gecko?
Mane Six,Huh?
Spike,Who you callin' a gecko?
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, Spike isn't for sale."
Vera,I want that fancy purple hair! I'll give ya two storm bucks for it!
Rarity,Two storm bucks?! It's worth more than that!
Twilight Sparkle,Heh?
Deer Creature,Gimme that pink one!
Pig Creature 1,I'll take the blue one!
Pig Creature 2,No! I want the blue one!
Louise,I need that lizard!
Creature 1,I'll take that picture of your sister!
Deer Creature,I want all seven for my collection!
Capper,"Back up, everyone! Back it up! Y'all in some serious danger! Now you didn't touch any of them, did you? Just look at all those colors! You think that's natural? They're infected with ""pastelis coloritis""."
Applejack,"Now, you listen here, fella, there ain't<U+0097>"
Capper,"Don't worry, don't worry, as long as you're not covered in purple splotches, you'll be fine. Uh-oh."
Mori,[gasps] What do I do?!
Capper,Enjoy your last moments and don't touch anyone. Because parts will fall off.
Mori,[screams] Me parts!
Rainbow Dash,You are awesome!
Capper,Mm-hm.
Spike,Huh!
Capper,"Capper's the name. Charming's my game. So... to the Hippos, then?"
Twilight Sparkle,I don't know if we should trust him.
Pinkie Pie,We could definitely use a friend out here!
Capper,"You know what? Little Cotton Candy Hair is right. And, if I do say so myself..."
Capper,This town is not a nice place For little fillies all alone There are lots of twists and corners That could lead to the unknown
Others,Let me guide your way And I'll be sure to help you through You could really use a friend out here And luckily for you...
Others,"I'm the friend that you need When you're lost and don't know what to do I'm your pal, your amigo Useful and resourceful, too"
Others,"And my help, you'll concede Is a plus guaranteed You can call and I'll come running Just follow my lead 'Cause I'm the friend you need!"
Others,[Klugetown Wool-Seller] He's a friend
Scaly Klugetowner,Quite a friend!
Capper,You need a bud to spot the danger A pal to stop the creep A chum and not a stranger to assist
Others,You need a bro who is cunning That can help you take the leap A friend who knows what's lying in the mist
Others,"Don't fear these darkened alleys They're scary, yes, I know Why, you could use a friend To protect you wherever you go"
Others,And such a dazzling beauty Covered in dirt and muck But now your fate is changing Now you are in luck
Others,"'Cause I'm the friend that you need When you're lost and don't know what to do I'm your pal, your amigo Lookin' out for friends like you"
Others,"And my help, you'll concede Is a plus guaranteed Just call and I'll come running We'll say it's agreed..."
to Needy,"Here. Tell Verko, ""My place, twenty minutes."" I've got something that will ""magically"" erase all my debt."
Others,'Cause I'm the friend you need!
Others,"[Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash] He's a friend"
Rarity,Quite a friend!
Ponies except Twilight Sparkle,He's a friend indeed!
Capper,"Welcome, my little ponies, to my little manor."
Rarity,Ooh! A sort of a roco-hobo-Bohemian hodgepodge.
Capper,Apologies for the state of my litter box. I wasn't expecting guests.
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! So many fun breakables!
Rainbow Dash,Whoa!
Capper,Y'all sure y'all want the Hippos?
Pinkie Pie,Yessirree! The Queen of the Hippos!
Capper,"Not like the Queen of the Lions, or Tigers, or Bears?"
Fluttershy,"Oh, my!"
Twilight Sparkle,Huh?
Grubber,You really think the ponieth got thith far?
Tempest Shadow,"[sniffs] Oh, they're here. Attention! A little purple pony passed this way. Tell me where she is..."
Mori,"You think we're gonna fall for this again? I don't know what kinda scam you're workin' with Capper and the rest of your friends, but--"
Tempest Shadow,"""Friends?"""
Mori,"Poison or no poison, you're gonna pay!"
Grubber,"Ohhhh, Fishman juth got dropped!"
Tempest Shadow,Now...
Mori,Ihhhh...
Tempest Shadow,"...about this... ""Capper""..."
Capper,Stop playin' me! A sonic rainboom? That's not a real thang! Is that a real thing?
Rainbow Dash,I'll show ya!
Capper,"Naw-naw-naw, I don't need you sonic ""rainbooming"" up in my place, thank you very much. Whoa, hey, hold up now. Whoa."
Rarity,"Here you go. I do apologize. If we were back home, I could've done something truly fabulous."
Capper,Okay... What's the catch?
Rarity,"Nothing. After all that you've done for us, consider it a ""thank you""."
Capper,"Oh. Uh, don't thank me. Really."
Twilight Sparkle,"Guys! We've been looking for the wrong queen! We don't need the Queen of the Hippos! We need the Queen of the Hippogriffs! Part pony, part eagle!"
Capper,"Oh! Oh, the Hippogriffs! Now, the trouble with that is... no one knows... where they are..."
Twilight Sparkle,Says here they're on the top of Mount Aris!
Pinkie Pie,You mean the mountain right outside the window?
Capper,Objects in windows may be less mountainous than they appear. Heh heh heh...
Twilight Sparkle,"Let's go, everypony."
Capper,"[gasps] Wait! [cat yowl] You can't<U+0097>you can't make it by y'allselves. You need an airship! And lucky for you, I can get you a ride."
Twilight Sparkle,I think we can get there on our own.
Verko,These ponies better shoot rainbow lasers out their eyes if they're gonna settle your debt! Brought the big cage. Let's load 'em up!
Rarity,You were... You were going to sell us?
Twilight Sparkle,I knew it! We gotta get outta here!
Tempest Shadow,Silly little ponies.
Twilight Sparkle,Tempest!
Tempest Shadow,[resumes chuckling] Trusting strangers? Big mistake. Big...
Grubber,Huge!
Verko,"Hoo-hoo! My goodness! Well, look at you! With your scary broken horn and scowly eyes. What tricks do you know, my little pony-wony?"
Twilight Sparkle,Go! Go!
Tempest Shadow,Get her now!
Grubber,"You gonna be thcared now, ponieth!"
Applejack,I'm... gonna... be... sick!
Twilight Sparkle,We have to get there! To the docks! Hurry!
Applejack,That's it.
Applejack,Don't look down now!
Pinkie Pie,Yay!
Spike,Dah!
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie,Best... escape... plan... ever!
Twilight Sparkle,WHAT?!?! Thwa!
Spike,Shh!
Boyle,Did you hear something?
Boyle,"Eh, probably just the rats. If we find 'em, we'll eat 'em."
Rarity,Rats?
Tempest Shadow,Now... where are they going?
Capper,"Okay. No need for violence. Uh, they're headed..."
Tempest Shadow,"When I get my Princess. Until then, your fate is still... up in the air."
Grubber,"We make a great team. I love it how you thaid hith fate wuth ""up in the air"", and then I thaid, ""you're gonna be in the air on an air-boat!"""
Rainbow Dash,Blugh!
Applejack,"Whadaya think, Twilight? Should we just... ask 'em to take us?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Last time we trusted somepony, he tried to sell us!"
Boyle,"Hey, guys! Come check this out!"
Mullet,Looks like a pack of stowaways.
Lix Spittle,What are we s'posed to do with 'em?
Boyle,I think we tie 'em up!
Lix Spittle,[squawks] We clip their wings!
Mullet,Nah. We scar 'em...
Mullet,...emotionally!
Mullet,"Wai-wai-wai-wait. What say the book, Captain Celaeno?"
Captain Celaeno,"Storm King's rule book says, ""Throw them overboard."""
Mane Six,Huh?
Captain Celaeno,All right! That's lunch!
Twilight Sparkle,What?
Rainbow Dash,Whoa whoa whoa! So you were about to toss us overboard and you stopped for a lunch break?
Boyle,"Storm King only allows one break a day for meals, then it's back to hauling goods."
Spike,So you're delivery guys?
Captain Celaeno,And gals. These uniforms aren't exactly doing us any favors.
Twilight Sparkle,Then can you deliver us to Mount Aris?
Captain Celaeno,Sorry. We do what the Storm King orders or we suffer his wrath.
Twilight Sparkle,Right. Still going overboard.
Lix Spittle,"Eh, it's nothing personal. Pudding?"
Rarity,There's pudding?
Rarity,Oh.
Rainbow Dash,"You weren't always delivery birds, were you? What about before the Storm King?"
Captain Celaeno,Yeah. We used to be much more adventurous.
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! I met that guy in the desert!
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! You used to be pirates?!
Mullet,"Um, we prefer the term ""swashbuckling treasure hunters""."
Rainbow Dash,So... pirates.
Rainbow Dash,"You birds have a choice to make. You could let some cloven-hoofed Storm King tell you how to live your lives, or..."
Rainbow Dash,...you could be awesome again!
Twilight Sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, this really isn't a good time for a<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,I know the world can get you down
Twilight Sparkle,<U+0097>song.
Others,Things don't work out quite the way that you thought Feeling like all your best days are done Your fears and doubts are all you've got
Others,"But there's a light shining deep inside Beneath those fears and doubts, so just squash 'em And let it shine for all the world to see That it is time, yeah, time to be awesome"
Ponies,"Ah, ah, ah-ah, awesome! It's time to be so awesome! Ah, ah, ah-ah, awesome! It's time to be so awesome!"
Captain Celaeno,You've no idea how hard it's been
Ponies,(It's time to be awesome!)
Captain Celaeno,This dull routine we've been forced to do
Rainbow Dash,"Don't let them rob you of who you are Be awesome, it's all up to you"
Captain Celaeno,I feel the light stirring deep inside It's like a tale still yet to be told
Ponies,(It's time to be awesome!)
Rainbow Dash and Captain Celaeno,And now it's time to break the shackles free And start living like the brave and the bold!
All,"It's time to be awesome! Let loose, be true, so awesome! It's time to be awesome! Go big, be you, so awesome!"
Mullet,We used to soar through the clouds in the skies
Lix Spittle,Elaborate schemes we would love to devise
Boyle,We rescued our treasure and stored it away
Captain Celaeno,Saving those gemstones for a rainy day
All,We see that light filling up our skies
Rainbow Dash,So take the Storm King's orders and toss 'em
All,'Cause it's the time to let our colors fly
Captain Celaeno,"Hey, scallywags, it's time to be awesome!"
All,Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Captain Celaeno,Come on! Let's show these little ponies how it's done!
Rainbow Dash,Awesome! I knew you had it in ya! And now for the finishing touch!
Pinkie Pie,Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom!
Twilight Sparkle,No no no no no! No!
Captain Celaeno,Wow!
Twilight Sparkle,Ohhh!
Grubber,"[slurping] Huh? Huh? Looka that rainbow! Looka that rainbow! Whoa, that'th so cool!"
Tempest Shadow,"Yeah. Of them to alert us. Funny, though. [to Capper] They don't seem to be heading to Black Skull Island."
Capper,"Like ""ha ha"" funny or... ha ha..."
Captain Celaeno,Yeah! Ha ha!
Rainbow Dash,Nice!
Captain Celaeno,Storm guards! Looks like they found you!
Twilight Sparkle,Tempest!
Captain Celaeno,"Secure the rigging! Lock down the cargo! Everyone, prepare to be boarded!"
Fluttershy,Oh my goodness!
Rainbow Dash,Ya think she saw my sonic rainboom?
Twilight Sparkle,Are you kidding me?!?!
Spike,Whoa!
Tempest Shadow,Where is the Pony Princess?
Captain Celaeno,"""Princess""? Prin-Cess, Prin-Cess... Nope. All we're hauling is Storm King merchandise."
Tempest Shadow,"You do realize that if you were to shelter fugitives, the Storm King would be quite... explosive."
Twilight Sparkle,[whispering loudly] We have to get off this ship before they tell Tempest we're here!
Rainbow Dash,[whispering loudly] We helped them get their mojo back! They're not gonna give us up!
Pinkie Pie,Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,I've got this!
Tempest Shadow,"Now, I'm gonna count to three, and if you don't tell me where they are, your ship is going down. One..."
Twilight Sparkle,Hold this!
Rainbow Dash,What are you doing?!
Tempest Shadow,...two...
Grubber,"Oh, thith is inteeenth!"
Tempest Shadow,Three!
Tempest Shadow,What?
Rarity,"Oh, for Celestia's sake!!!"
Pinkie Pie,"[screams, laughs] Whee!"
Fluttershy,[yells] I can't look!
Rarity,[screams] Ooh! [resumes screaming] Huh?
Fluttershy,Ooh!
Pinkie Pie,Whee!
Rainbow Dash,Huh?
Applejack,What in the hay is she up to?
Pinkie Pie,Whee-hee-hee!
Rarity,Thank goodness.
Applejack,"Phee-yew! Quick thinkin', Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,Yahoo! Ha ha!
Pinkie Pie,That was fun! Can we do it again?
Rainbow Dash,"Next stop, Mount Aris!"
Twilight Sparkle,We're home free!
Grubber,"There'th no ponieth. But I found thith. It'th a... kind of a cupcake... with thprinkleth... Oh, yeah, and I found thith, too."
Tempest Shadow,Huh.
Grubber,"Wow, this is a real artitht!"
Tempest Shadow,Looks like they're heading to Mount Aris.
Capper,"Really? [stammering and laughing nervously] Mou- Mount Aris? I... Well, that's my mis<U+0097> I didn't know that... Mount Ari... My bad, I didn't... That's my... I'm sorry, I'm very very sorry."
Tempest Shadow,"Now, about your betrayal..."
Rarity,We had to crash the balloon at the bottom of the mountain! That's it! I simply... cannot... even! I have nothing! The bad guys have won! I'm so sorryyyyyyyy-y-y-y!
Rainbow Dash,We're almost there!
Rarity,[growls] Will you stop saying that?!
Rainbow Dash,"No, really! We're actually here!"
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] This is it!
Pinkie Pie,Ooh!
Applejack,"Well, I'll be. [laughs] Hippogriffs, here we come!"
Rarity,[sighs] Time to rest my hooves!
Rarity,Are we sure this is the right place?
Applejack,Hello?! Is anypony home?!
Pinkie Pie,No Hippogriffies here! Or here! Or here! Or here or here or here! Waaaaaiiit! Nope! This place is emp-ty!
Twilight Sparkle,But... Celestia... The map. They have to be here.
Spike,Something bad happened here. Something that turned this whole place into a ghost town.
Fluttershy,A g-g-g-g-ghost town?!
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] It's coming from over there!
Princess Skystar,[gasps] What was that?!
Pinkie Pie,Hey! Wait up! Cannonball!
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie,[sputters] She's gone!
Twilight Sparkle,Now what?
Pinkie Pie,Huh?
Rarity,"Oh, boy. I hate epic adventures."
Pinkie Pie,"Way to leave it to the last minute, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,I didn't make these bubbles!
Fluttershy,Then [pants] who did?
Twilight Sparkle,Hello? We're looking for the Hippogriffs.
Princess Skystar,How do I know I can trust you?
Twilight Sparkle,Please. The Storm King invaded our land. And we need their help.
Princess Skystar,The Storm King?! I'm so glad I saved you guys! I'm totally taking you to my mom!
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] Does your mother know where they are?
Twilight Sparkle,Hoo-hoo!
Princess Skystar,We're almost there!
Mane Six and Spike,Wow!
Princess Skystar,"Mother, look what I found!"
Queen Novo,Is it another shell?
Princess Skystar,Mm-mm.
Queen Novo,"Because I am telling you if it is another shell, I am<U+0097> [gasps loudly] Princess Skystar, whatta you done?! You know surface dwellers are forbidden here! Guards!"
Princess Skystar,"No no n-no! M-M-Mom, please! It is so not like that! The Storm King is trying to destroy their home, too!"
Twilight Sparkle,We need to find the Hippogriffs. Do you know what happened to them?
Queen Novo,"Well, of course I know. I'm the queen. I know everything."
Princess Skystar,"Oh, oh, it's such a good story!"
Queen Novo,Don't you dare tell them!
Princess Skystar,"Once upon a time, like, a while ago, the Hippogriffs did live on Mount Aris."
Mane Six,Oooh!
Queen Novo,"Did I not say don't tell them? But hey, I'm just the queen. Don't mind me."
Princess Skystar,"Fine! I can't tell you! But if I could tell you, I'd say that that horned beast did show up to steal their magic!"
Queen Novo,Seriously?
Princess Skystar,"But, to keep it out of his clutches, their brave and majestic leader, Queen Novo, hid them deep underwater where he could never go! We are... Well, we were the Hippogriffs! Ta-da! [laughs] [whispering] But I totally did not tell you that!"
Queen Novo,"Well, I guess the pearl is out the oyster now. I am Queen Novo."
Applejack,"Hold on now. Lemme get this straight. When the Storm King came, you just abandoned your entire city and fled?"
Princess Skystar,"We didn't flee! We swam! Y'know, in order to flee."
Twilight Sparkle,But... how?
Princess Skystar,"Oh! Can we show them? Huh? These are the first guests we've had in, like, foreveeerrr! Can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we?"
Queen Novo,"Careful, now."
Mane Six,Huh?
Fluttershy,Wow!
Rarity,These fins are divine!
Rainbow Dash,"Hey, Applejack, I'll race ya to that coral!"
Applejack,You're on!
Pinkie Pie,"Woo-hoo! [giggles] Ooh! Try it, Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy,[giggles] Yay.
Spike,Guys? Guys? What is... [puffs] ...happening?!
Fluttershy,"Aw, so cute!"
Twilight Sparkle,"This is amazing! With this, we could transform everypony at home into something powerful enough to face the Storm King's army!"
Queen Novo,Or it could end up in his greedy claws!
Twilight Sparkle,But...
Queen Novo,"Honey, I'm sorry about your home. I truly am. But my responsibility is to protect my subjects. The pearl... is not going anywhere."
Twilight Sparkle,But we've come all this way. And you can't just hide down here! Trapped forever! There's so much you're missing!
Queen Novo,We are one hundred percent okay with that!
Queen Novo,"Yes, Jamal?"
Queen Novo,Ooh! Time for my seaweed wrap.
Queen Novo,"Yes, a massage, too. Mama needs her deep tissue."
Applejack,So that's it? We left home for nothin'?
Princess Skystar,"Oh, my gosh! Best... idea! You can stay with us! Forever! [laughs] There are so many things we can do! We can make friendship bracelets out of shells and... picture frames outta shells and... decorative wastebaskets out of shells... Oh, I have so many projects that involve shells, haha! Now I have someone new to share them with! I mean, aside from my friends, Shelly and Sheldon. Right? ""Shelly""?"
Rarity,"Ooh, ooh..."
Rarity,"That sounds lovely, darling, but you must realize, we can't stay."
Applejack,We've gotta get back to our families.
Princess Skystar,"Oh, no. Of course. Of course. Heh. Of course you have your own friends back home. It's fine. It's fine. Heh. [whispering] Shelly and Sheldon get jealous anyways. Heh. It's probably for the best. [sighs] Yeah, I'll just, um... [sadly] I'll get Mom to, uh, turn you back so you can go home."
Pinkie Pie,"I know we have to go, but you guys saw how disappointed Princess Skystar was. Couldn't we stay for just a little longer?"
Applejack,"Pinkie, we just don't have time for<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,"Oh, no. No no. Pinkie's right."
Rainbow Dash,Say what now?
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, we still need to come up with a plan to get back. A few minutes won't make a huge difference. And if there's anypony who can cram a lifetime of fun into a blink of an eye, it's Pinkie Pie!"
Twilight Sparkle,"So, go ahead and show Skystar the best time ever!"
Pinkie Pie,I won't let you down!
Twilight Sparkle,I'm counting on it.
Pinkie Pie,"[as Shelly] Hey, now, don't be sad [as Sheldon] I know we cannot stay [normal voice] But we've got a couple minutes And a little time to play"
Princess Skystar,"I know you have important things So it's okay, just go"
Pinkie Pie,"But we can still pick one small, little thing To do with you, y'know!"
Others,"One small thing doesn't seem like a lot One small thing, work with the time you've got Soon, one small thing becomes two After two, perhaps another few Then one small thing is not so small One small thing can be the biggest thing of all"
Princess Skystar,"All right now, since you're here Let's see what we can do Swim with the flow until you go Together, me and you"
Pinkie Pie,I've got necklaces for everyfish So what else do ya got?
Princess Skystar,"Well, we could play the bubblefish You'll like this one a lot!"
Pinkie Pie and Princess Skystar,"One small thing, it's a good place to start"
Others,"[Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy] (Just one small thing)"
Pinkie Pie and Princess Skystar,"One small thing, and we don't seem so far apart"
Others,"[Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy] (Don't seem apart)"
All,"Soon, one small thing leads to more It's so much more than there was before Just one small thing, and you will see The start of something big for you and me"
Pinkie Pie,One small thing
Seaponies,Just one small thing
Princess Skystar,Or a tall thing
Seaponies,Just one tall thing
Fluttershy,Or a sing thing
Seaponies,Just one sing-y thing
Rarity,Or a bling thing
All,Just one bling-y thing
Applejack,A conga thing
All,"Yeah, a conga thing"
Rainbow Dash,Or a longah thing
Seaponies,Just one longah thing
Pinkie Pie,"A blue thing, true thing, you thing"
Seaponies,(Oooh-oooh)
Princess Skystar,"A whee thing, sea thing, me thing"
Seaponies,(Oooh-oooh-oooh!)
Pinkie Pie and Princess Skystar,So many things and everything until our time is done There's one small thing for each and everyone!
Princess Skystar,"One small thing, so much we can create You and me, we started something great It's so amazing, look around At all the happy sights and sounds One small thing is big, it's true You did this all for us I just wish there was one small thing An extra special kind of thing"
Princess Skystar and Seaponies,That we could do for you... One small thing!
Princess Skystar,Hmm?
Queen Novo,"Well, I guess there is one small thing we can do."
Pinkie Pie,Ahhh!
Female seapony,"The pearl alarm! Oh, no, the pearl alarm!"
Twilight Sparkle,[struggling] Ow!
Twilight Sparkle,No! Please!
Queen Novo,All of this so you could sneak in and take the pearl?!
Queen Novo,"[to Skystar] This is why we don't bring strangers into our home! [to Twilight, ominously] You don't deserve to be one of us."
Applejack,"What were you thinkin'? I mean, stealin' their pearl?"
Twilight Sparkle,[sighs] It was the only way to save Equestria.
Pinkie Pie,'Cept it wasn't! The Queen was going to say yes! We did what you told us and that's what made her realize we were ponies worth saving! [gasps] Unless... You didn't really want us to show her the best time ever! You just wanted us to distract her!
Twilight Sparkle,"I never would have done it, but this isn't Equestria! We can't just dance around with con artists, make rainbooms in the sky and expect everything to work out! It's not enough! We are not enough!"
Pinkie Pie,"No, Twilight! We stuck together! We were gonna get the help we needed! The only thing that stopped us... was you!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I'm doing the best I can!  It's all on me. I'm the one Tempest wants. I'm the last Princess!"
Pinkie Pie,You're also the only one who doesn't trust her friends!
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, maybe, I would've been better off without friends like you!!!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Pinkie, I..."
Pinkie Pie,[sniffles] I just can't talk to you right now.
Spike,Twilight? It's okay. You'll figure it out.
Spike,"[muffled] Twilight, look out!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[screams, gasps] No no no no no! Noooooo!"
Spike,"[muffled] Twilight, help me!"
Twilight Sparkle,Spiiiiiike!!!
Spike,Twiliiiiiight!!!
Tempest Shadow,"Aww, the ""Princess of Friendship"". With no friends! [chuckles] And no way out."
Twilight Sparkle,Why are you doing this? You're a pony! Just like me.
Tempest Shadow,I'm nothing like you! I'm more than you'll ever be!
Tempest Shadow,It's time you learned a lesson It's time that you understand Don't ever count on anybody else In this or any other land
Others,I once hoped for friendship To find a place among my kind But those were the childish wishes Of someone who was blind
Others,"Open up your eyes See the world from where I stand Me, among the mighty You, caged at my command"
Others,"Open up your eyes Give up your sweet fantasy land It's time to grow up and get wise Come now, little one, open up your eyes"
Others,We all start out the same With simple naive trust Shielded from the many ways That life's not fair or just
Others,But then there comes a moment A simple truth that you must face If you depend on others You'll never find your place
Others,And as you take that first step Upon a path that's all your own You see it all so clearly The best way to survive is all alone
Others,"Open up your eyes See the world from where I stand Me, among the mighty You, caged at my command"
Others,"Open up your eyes And behold the faded light It's time to grow up and get wise Come now, little one, open up your eyes"
Others,Open up your eyes!
Twilight Sparkle,I'm so sorry you felt so alone.
Tempest Shadow,"I saw the truth. My ""friends"" abandoned me when times got tough. Looks like I'm not the only one. Face it, Princess. Friendship has failed you, too."
Twilight Sparkle,Friendship didn't fail me. I failed friendship.
Fluttershy,[sighs] This whole journey was such a mistake. [gasps] All we wanted was somepony to help us.
Applejack,"[sighs] Ya think, maybe it's time we talk to Twilight?"
Spike,She's! Been! Taken!!!
Rainbow Dash,What?!
Spike,[panting] Twilight's been taken! Tempest! She grabbed her! And took her on her ship!
Rainbow Dash,We gotta get her back!
Fluttershy,How? We'll never catch up!
Applejack,And we got no way to defeat those monsters.
Capper,"Well, good thing I happen to know of a group of mighty heroes that could handle this easily!"
Rarity,[angrily] Well! Look what the cat dragged in! Himself!
Capper,"These heroes have faced the Storm King's army and escaped! I've seen them tackle the streets of the roughest towns, break out of the tightest situations, and inspire others to join their cause!"
Rest of the Mane Six and Spike,Ooooh.
Applejack,Now don't get too excited. He's just talkin' about us.
Rest of the Mane Six and Spike,Awww.
Capper,They even escaped certain doom at the hooves of Commander Tempest!
Rainbow Dash,Yeah. That was pretty great.
Captain Celaeno,Are you kidding me?! That was awesome!
Boyle,Figured you could use a claw!
Captain Celaeno,We're on board to help you fight the Storm King! Just not on board our... actual ship.
Mullet,That crazy unicorn sunk it. But you got back our argh! And we're ready to kick some booty.
Spike,Whoa!
Capper,Is that what I think it is?
Princess Skystar,"Hellooooooo!! Me again! [giggles] I'm gonna get so grounded, but I talked things over with Shelly and Sheldon and they pointed out that you were just trying to help your friends."
Pinkie Pie,Ahhhh!
Princess Skystar,So I wanna help too. 'Cause ya know... one small thing... [whispering] can make a really big difference!
Spike,"That's it, right? We didn't make friends with anypony else?"
Capper,"All right, y'all! I think our course is clear. Y'all ready to do this thang?"
Pinkie Pie,"We're coming, Twilight!"
Pinkie Pie,As soon as we bake up a plan!
Songbird Serenade,"I am here and I see your pain Through the storms, through the clouds, the rain I'm telling you you can not escape"
Twilight Sparkle,"Tempest, don't do this. Don't give the Storm King<U+0097>"
Tempest Shadow,Your magic? Did you think you'd keep it all to yourself? Time to share. I'd love for everybody out there to know what I can really do.
The Storm King,"Ooh, fascinating!  What can you really do?"
Grubber,"Your bidding, of courth, Your Mighty One."
The Storm King,"Bidding's good. I like bidding! Um, what are you supposed to be?"
Twilight Sparkle,I'm the Princess of Friendship!
The Storm King,[laughs] Oh. That's nice. [to Tempest] Why is this one still moving?
Tempest Shadow,"She and her friends put up a bit of a fight, but she's alone now. She won't be a problem."
Twilight Sparkle,[struggling] No!
The Storm King,[laughs] Check out the light show! Wow! Wow!
The Storm King,"Let's get this storm started! Ooh, hey, that's good. I should trademark that."
The Storm King,"Not bad. Actually, kinda first rate. What else does it do?"
Tempest Shadow,"Your Excellency, you promised to restore my horn and give me<U+0097>"
The Storm King,"Deh-deh-deh-deh-deh, okay. Hang on."
Capper,"Uh, yeah, I got a delivery here for a Mister ""The Storm King"". I was given explicit instructions to bring this here cake to this here castle's throne room."
Capper,"All right, then. Look here. Could one o' y'all go be a pal, go tell your boss he's not gettin' his ""congratulations on subduing defenseless pastel ponies"" cake? 'Cause I don't wanna be the one responsible for the big guy missin' his special dessert. You know what I'm sayin'?"
Capper,"Thank you kindly, fellas. I'mma be sure and put in a good word for the botha y'all."
Applejack,"[quietly] Pinkie, quit lookin' so happy! Ya ain't foolin' nopony!"
Grubber,"Mmm! Pie! Oh, hello, cake! Ooh! Don't mind if I do!"
Grubber,"Mmm! That's some, like, gourmet ithing! Who putth eyeballth in filling? [hyperventilates] Guards!"
Capper,Uh-oh. Plan B?
Rainbow Dash,The jig is up!
Captain Celaeno,Come on!
Mullet,Harr!
Princess Skystar,Oof! [grunts] Gotcha!
Rarity,Lovely!
Pinkie Pie,Surprise!
Pinkie Pie,Double surprise!!
Fluttershy,[whimpers] Ooh!
Fluttershy,You seem tense. Do you wanna talk about it?
Storm Creature,Huh?
Captain Celaeno,Yeah!
Rainbow Dash,Yeah!
Captain Celaeno,Head for the castle! We'll hold them off!
Rainbow Dash,Come on!
Fluttershy,Let it all out.
Everypony else,Fluttershy!
Fluttershy,"Oh! Sorry, our time is up. Buh-bye!"
Storm Creature,Goodbye!
Princess Skystar,Keep going! Shelly? Sheldon?
Storm Creature,[grunts] I can't see!
Applejack,Uh-oh.
Capper,"[to Spike] Hey, ain't you a fire-breathin' dragon?"
Tempest Shadow,What?! How?!
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] It's... It's the Magic of...
The Storm King,"Yeah, yeah! Friendship, and flowers, and ponies, and bleh! I'm so totally over the cute pony thing. This... ends... now!"
Capper,Uh-oh.
The Storm King,[maniacal laughter] Yeah!
Capper,"Move them hooves, ponies!"
Rainbow Dash,You'd have to be flying faster than a speeding Pegasus to break through that wind!
Pinkie Pie,"[gasps] Excellent idea, Rainbow Dash!"
The Storm King,"Now I truly am the Storm King! And the entire world will bow to my ba-ba-ba-boom, baby!"
Tempest Shadow,"Yes, yes, you are every bit as powerful as I promised, Sire, now, restore my horn and I swear to use my magic to serve you!"
The Storm King,[laughs] Who cares about your dinky little unicorn horn?!
Tempest Shadow,But... we... we had an agreement!
The Storm King,Get with the program! I used you! It's kind of what I do!
The Storm King,Ahh!
The Storm King,Ow!
Twilight Sparkle,Hold on!
Tempest Shadow,Why are you saving me?
Twilight Sparkle,Because this is what friends do.
The Storm King,[sarcastically] Awwww! Isn't that just so sweet! [laughs] Yeah. See ya!
Mullet,You sure about this?
Pinkie Pie,Just do it! Thank you! I'm excited! Who's excited?! Aaah! I've never been so excited!
Pinkie Pie,[laughs] Whee!
The Storm King,[laughs] Ooh!
Pinkie Pie,[weakly] Bull's-eye!
Twilight Sparkle,Pinkie! You all came back! I'm so sorry! I was wrong to<U+0097>
Pinkie Pie,"I'm sorry, too. Friends mess up sometimes, but we never should've<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,"Uh, make up later! This isn't over!"
Twilight Sparkle,"[grunts, gasps] I've gotta get control of it!"
Pinkie Pie,"Go! You've got this, Twilight!"
Twilight Sparkle,No. We've got this. Together.
Pinkie Pie,Whee!
The Storm King,[grunts] The staff belongs to me!
The Storm King,Miiiiiine!! Mine!!!
Applejack,Whoa!
Twilight Sparkle,No!
Pinkie Pie,Twilight! Nooooooooooo!!!
Pinkie Pie,Yay!
Applejack,Yee-haw! [laughs] All right!
Tempest Shadow,Nooo!!
Rainbow Dash,Whoa! I can't believe she did that!
Twilight Sparkle,I can.
Fluttershy,Now what?
Tempest Shadow,Now... we fix everything.
Princess Celestia,[gasps] Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle,Princesses! Oh!
Spike,"[clears throat] Fillies and gentlecolts, get ready for a little..."
Spike,Songbird Serenade!
Songbird Serenade,"And now, to celebrate the fact that we're all still here in one piece, give it up for Princess Twilight and her friends!"
Code Red,"All right! Way to go, guys!"
Bulk Biceps,Yeah! Ha ha ha ha!
Songbird Serenade,"I know you, you're a special one Some see crazy where I see love You fall so low but shoot so high Big dreamers shoot for open sky"
Others,"So much life in those open eyes So much depth, you look for the light"
Capper,Ooh!
Rarity,And perfection!
Songbird Serenade,"But when your wounds open, you will cry"
Princess Skystar,[gasps] Mom!
Songbird Serenade,You'll cry out now and you'll question why
Others,I can see a rainbow In your tears as they fall on down I can see your soul grow Through the pain as they hit the ground I can see a rainbow In your tears as the sun comes out As the sun comes out
Tempest Shadow,"Well, that's one thing that never changes around here. The party."
Twilight Sparkle,"Well, I hope you'll stay. More friends are definitely merrier."
Tempest Shadow,"[sighs] But, um... my horn."
Twilight Sparkle,"You know, your horn is pretty powerful, just like the pony it belongs to."
Tempest Shadow,"I did tell you I wanted to show everypony in Equestria what I could do, right?"
Songbird Serenade,I can see a rainbow In your tears as they fall on down I can see your soul grow Through the pain as they hit the ground
Pinkie Pie,"Nice touch, Tempest!"
Tempest Shadow,"Actually, that's not my real name."
Pinkie Pie,Oooh! What is it?!
Tempest Shadow,"[quietly] It's ""Fizzlepop Berrytwist""."
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] Okay! That is the most awesome name ever!
Songbird Serenade,I can see a rainbow In your tears as they fall on down I can see your soul grow Through the pain as they hit the ground I can see a rainbow In your tears as the sun comes out As the sun comes out
Others,"I am here and I see your pain Through the storms, through the clouds, the rain I'm telling you you can not escape You can do it, just feel, baby"
Others,I can see a rainbow In your tears as they fall on down I can see your soul grow Through the pain as they hit the ground I can see a rainbow In your tears as they fall on down I can see your soul grow Through the pain as they hit the ground In your tears as the sun comes out As the sun comes out
Others,Here comes the sun smiling down Here comes the sun smiling down Here comes the sun smiling down Smiling down
Others,I can see a rainbow In your tears as they fall on down I can see your soul grow Through the pain as they hit the ground I can see a rainbow In your<U+0097> As the sun comes out
Lukas Graham,"So, we wanna stay But can't find peace while sittin' still I guess we never will We're on the way We won't hurry back again The journey is the end (oh)"
Others,"I love this very moment We're speedin' up, not slowin' We might know we can't win But we're dumb enough to try We're going, there's no maybe That's why they call us crazy And we'll say if anybody asks us"
Others,"""Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?"" [clap clap] We're off to see the world We don't need to know (oh) ""Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?"" [clap clap] We're off to see the world We don't need to know"
Others,We never need to know Seekin' boundaries to break Let's forget the ones we've made So we carry on Don't let good things pass us by The time we're gone will be the best time of our life
Others,"I love this very moment We're speedin' up, not slowin' We might know we can't win But we're dumb enough to try We're going, there's no maybe That's why they call us crazy And we'll say if anybody asks us"

Others,So go tell 'em we won't stop We know they can't change us We're gonna go way off the map To get ourselves back on the track
Others,Go tell 'em we won't stop We know they can't change us No need to worry so much We do whatever we want (oh)
Others,"""Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?"" [clap clap] We're off to see the world We don't need to know (oh) ""Hey (hey!), where you gonna go?"" [clap clap] We're off to see the world We don't need to know (oh)"

Alice,"[voiceover] 'Twas a single day left before Hearth's Warming Eve,"
Others,"Everypony was busy, so much to achieve;"
Others,"They hustled and bustled, their heads were a-spin,"
Others,And it's here that our holiday story begins...
Ponies,Hearth's Warming Eve is almost here There's so much left to do
Rainbow Dash,Still need to shop for all my friends But what to get? No clue!
Fluttershy,"This one is nice, and that's so cute Although that's pretty, too"
Rarity,Why do I make all these gifts each year? I doubt I'll make it through
Others,"[Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, and Rarity] One more day before the cheer"
Ponies,Shop! Pay! Box! Wrap! Bow! Repeat!
Others,"[Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, and Rarity] One last chance before the holiday's here"
Ponies,Box! Wrap! Bow! Again!
Others,"[Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, and Rarity] One more day to make the holiday great One more day before we celebrate"
Rarity,"One day, and then it's here"
Others,"[Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, and Rarity] One more chance to bring that holiday cheer"
Pinkie Pie,Hearth's Warming Eve is almost here A day for us to share
Applejack,Friends and family all together
Pinkie Pie,Pies and Apples and a Pear
Applejack,"Together families, lots of work There's so much to prepare"
Pinkie Pie and Applejack,With all the planning we still have to do We've got no time to spare
Ponies,One more day before the cheer
Pinkie Pie,Stuff! Box! Wrap! Card! Bow! Repeat!
Ponies,One last chance before the holiday's here
Pinkie Pie,Stir! Pour! Bake! Again!
Ponies,One more day to make the holiday bright
Wensley,"One more day, and I can sleep at night"
Applejack,The family's almost here
Ponies,One more chance to bring that holiday cheer
Others,"Before the fun, there's preparation (Just around the corner) Shopping, cooking, decorations (The complications)"
Others,"It's all worth it in the end Spreading joy to all your friends Even when it never, ever Ever seems to end Aah!"
Spike,"Hearth's Warming Eve is getting close We're not prepared, I fear Twilight, you should take a break"
Twilight Sparkle,"No time for rest, that much is clear"
Others,"I made a list and checked it twice There's lots to do on here Oh, if I can't get everything done I'll have to wait and celebrate next year"
Ponies,One more day before the cheer Shop! Pay! Box! Wrap! Bow! Repeat! One last chance before the holiday's here Box! Wrap! Bow! Again! One more day to make the holiday great One more day until we celebrate
Cutie Mark Crusaders,"Please, oh, please make it really, really great!"
Parcel Post,"One more gift, try to hurry, don't be late!"
Others,"[Daisy, Rose, and Lily] Box! Wrap! Bow! Repeat! Gotta concentrate!"
All,Just one more day until we all celebrate!
Rainbow Dash,"[grunts, to Twilight] Do we wanna know why you're wrapping up everypony in town?"
Spike,Not wrapping paper. A to-do list.
Twilight Sparkle,Two of these! Three of those! I'm gonna need ten of those! Just in case!
Rarity,"Twilight, darling, are you all right?"
Twilight Sparkle,Sure! Just-grabbing-a-few-things-do-I-need-this-no-that's-silly-I-need-eight!
Applejack,"Hey, y'all! What's everypony<U+0097>? Ohhh. Traditional holiday meltdown?"
Others,"Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Rarity, Spike, Uh-huh."
Applejack,"[calmly and quietly] Hey, Twilight. How's your day?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I got way behind grading midterms, and Cadance and Shining Armor are coming here with Flurry Heart for Hearth's Warming Eve, and I haven't started decorating, and I don't know what to get any of you, and<U+0097>!"
Applejack,Stop! Take a breath.
Applejack,Now let it out sloooooooooowwww...
Applejack,"Now, I think I have an idea that might help. What if we change up how we give gifts this year and do a Hearthswarmin' Helper?"
Fluttershy,What's a Hearthswarming Helper?
Applejack,"Whenever the whole Apple family got together, there were just so many of us, it didn't make sense to buy everypony gifts. So we'd put our names in a hat..."
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, a game of chance! Tell me more."
Applejack,"...then we'd pull a name, but keep it a secret."
Pinkie Pie,A dash of mystery. Good. Good.
Applejack,"Instead of buyin' everypony a present, you just get one for the pony you picked from the hat."
Pinkie Pie,"Wait. So instead of lots of presents, I only buy one of you a present? What kind of game is this?!"
Rarity,"Well, it would save time."
Rainbow Dash,"[clears throat] The less shopping, the better. In!"
Fluttershy,"Will that help, Twilight?"
Twilight Sparkle,I was stressed about shopping.
Pinkie Pie,[sighs] Fine. I will only buy one present for my secret Hearthswarming Helper buddy.
Applejack,We just need to put everypony's name in this here hat.
Applejack,Y'all ready? No peekin'.
Pinkie Pie,So excited! Aah! Too excited! I don't wanna give anything away!
Pinkie Pie,Wheeee!
Rarity,When will the gift exchange occur?
Rainbow Dash,"How about Twilight's castle tomorrow night, Hearth's Warming Eve?"
Applejack,That's perfect! Pinkie and I can spend the evenin' with y'all and the next mornin' with our families!
Twilight Sparkle,"And thanks to all of you, I should be ready to celebrate by then!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, this is so exciting!"
Spike,"Uh... Um, Applejack, is it against the rules to trade names? Like if I had a better idea for somepony special? I mean specific?"
Applejack,"If you can figure out who has the pony you want and they're okay with tradin', I guess it's fine."
Spike,"Great! So, uh, who do you<U+0097>?"
Applejack,I don't have Rarity.
Spike,What?! That's not who I<U+0097>!
Applejack,Uh-huh.
Spike,"Heeeey, Twilight! Whatcha planning to get your secret pony?"
Twilight Sparkle,Not sure. I'm getting the castle ready for my family first. Then I'll shop.
Spike,Maybe something sparkly? Fashionable?
Twilight Sparkle,No! Those aren't really the kind of things my pony likes.
Spike,"Oh. Welp, gotta go! Wish me luck!"
Twilight Sparkle,With shopping?
Spike,"Well, yeah! If everypony's only getting one gift, we have a ton of responsibility to make sure it's extra-special good."
Twilight Sparkle,"I didn't think of it that way. The present I get for Pinkie Pie should make or break her holiday. I can't just go shopping and hope to find something nice. This needs forethought, planning, research! I'll decoarate later. Knowing Pinkie, she probably already has a perfect idea what to get her pony."
Pinkie Pie,I have no idea what to get my pony!
Limestone Pie,"There's a pile of presents right there. Pick one, and you're done."
Pinkie Pie,Those were for when I was getting all of my friends matching harmony Hearth's Warming hats! Now it's just Twilight! [sobs] I can't give one pony a matching present with nothing to match it! I need something special for only her!
Maud Pie,[deadpan] I've got it.
Pinkie Pie,"I don't think Twilight likes rocks as much as you do, Maud."
Maud Pie,[deadpan] Don't rock it 'til you try it.
Pinkie Pie,"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Gummy. But this is the biggest holiday challenge I've ever faced!"
Pinkie Pie,"[to Limestone] Uh, this one's for you. Hey! This is the biggest holiday challenge I've ever faced! How exciting is that?! Am I up for the challenge? I know I'm good at gift-giving, but am I the best at gift-giving?"
Limestone Pie,Who would say they're the best at gift-giving? That's ridiculous.
Marble Pie,Uhhhh<U+0097>
Spike,Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie,I don't have Rarity!
Spike,Whoa!
Rarity,"Oh! [chuckles] How's your shopping going, Spike?"
Spike,"Uh, fine!"
Rarity,[whispering] Which pony did you get?
Spike,I can't... remember?
Rarity,"I've got Applejack, darling. She's going to adore her present. There's a brilliant designer in Manehattan <U+0096> Fedora Felt <U+0096> who makes the most marvelous hats. I asked for a new take on western chic that would be the envy of every farm pony in Equestria."
Spike,"That's a great gift, Rarity. I hope I can find something for my pony as special as you are. Uh, she is! U-Uh, bye!"
Rainbow Dash,"Okay, what about your favorite food?"
Fluttershy,Ooh. I couldn't pick just one. What if it hurt the other foods' feelings?
Rainbow Dash,"Riiiiight... But there's gotta be something you really, really like."
Fluttershy,"I really, really like... everything! Why do you ask?"
Rainbow Dash,"Juuuust getting gift ideas. Uh, for my pony. Who isn't you. So, uh, is there anything you don't like?"
Fluttershy,Hmmm... Not liking things!
Fluttershy,I hope that helped!
Spike,"Hey, Fluttershy! Thinking of getting that for your Hearthswarming Helper?"
Fluttershy,Mm-hmm. She loves shiny things.
Spike,[overacted] I wish I knew what my secret pony wanted. She's so hard to shop for.
Fluttershy,"Oh, no. Maybe I could help. Unless you don't want to<U+0097>"
Spike,Rainbow Dash.
Fluttershy,Oh! I was just talking to Rainbow Dash about these<U+0097>
Spike,Great idea! We should trade ponies!
Fluttershy,Wait. Trade?
Spike,"Well, Applejack said it's not against the rules. And you know what Rainbow Dash likes, so it's perfect. [gasps] Rarity?! What a surprise! [chuckles] Thanks!"
Applejack,There you are! I need your help.
Fluttershy,"Do you want to trade names, too?"
Applejack,What? No. I just need help figurin' out what to get Spike.
Fluttershy,Phew!
Rainbow Dash,Candle. Great. Whatever. Fluttershy-shopping done.
Discord,Ugh. You can't honestly be serious.
Rainbow Dash,Ghost candle!
Discord,A candle is what you buy when you have no idea what to get somepony.
Rainbow Dash,"[groans] What do you want, Discord?"
Discord,"Fluttershy told me about this Hearth's whatever-it's-called. I may not be invited, but I wanted to make sure she gets a quality gift."
Rainbow Dash,"I tried asking her what she likes, but she likes everything."
Discord,"Well, she says that, but her real friends know what she actually likes."
Rainbow Dash,I've known her a lot longer than you have.
Discord,"Then you must surely know that lit candles around adorably flammable animals make her nervous, don't you?"
Rainbow Dash,[groans] Fine. I'll get her something else.
Discord,Perhaps I'll tag along to steer you in the right direction.
Rainbow Dash,Whoa!
Fluttershy,I come to the Rainbow Falls Hearth's Warming Craft Fair every year. They have perfect presents for anypony.
Applejack,"Hopefully, anydragon, too. Wanna split up? Meet back here in an hour?"
Fluttershy,Sure.
Flam,"Oh, no! There's only a few left!"
Flim,"Fillies and gentlecolts, we want you all to have the best holiday your bits can buy! But there are only a limited number left!"
Fluttershy,[to Flam] Limited number of what?
Flam,"Why, you don't know about Holly the Hearth Warmer?"
Flim,You seem like somepony looking for a gift for a very special friend.
Fluttershy,I am!
Flim,A friend who wouldn't want to miss out on the must-have gift everypony is talking about?
Fluttershy,She certainly wouldn't wanna miss out on that.
Flim,A truly awesome friend who deserves something twenty percent cooler than any other gift out there?
Fluttershy,That sounds just like her!
Flim,"Well, look no further! This is it!"
Fluttershy,Ooh! Ooh! How much does it cost?!
Flim,How much do you have?
Prince Rutherford,Yojan! Is that good angle for optimal smashing?!
Pinkie Pie,Guess who!
Prince Rutherford,Yojan?
Pinkie Pie,"No, silly!"
Prince Rutherford,"Ingville? Tormand? No, no, wait! Grimhorn!"
Pinkie Pie,"Nope-ity, nope, nein, and nyet! It's me!"
Prince Rutherford,"Aww, Prince Rutherford knew it Pink Pony all along! Yaks best at guessing."
Prince Rutherford,[exclaims] Not here! Follow this way!
Prince Rutherford,[whispering] Prince Rutherford about to tell honorary yak friend something very top secret.
Pinkie Pie,Honorary yak friend listening.
Prince Rutherford,[whispering] Yaks best at all things except one. Yaks not best at giving gifts.
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] What?!
Prince Rutherford,[whispering] I know! It hard to believe!
Pinkie Pie,How am I gonna figure out how to give Twilight the best Hearth's Warming gift ever?!
Prince Rutherford,"[whispering] Oh, no worry, honorary yak. Prince Rutherford keep secret map in perfectly organized files."
Prince Rutherford,"Best gift givers up northern pass, where sky shimmers and glows. There, secret gift giver grove. Only yak princes and pink honorary yak know."
Pinkie Pie,[muffled] My lips are sealed.
Pinkie Pie,[shouting] Time for my top-secret quest to the Gift Givers!
Derpy,"Oh, hi, Rarity. How can I help you?"
Rarity,"I expected a package today, and I was wondering where that might be."
Derpy,"Oh, okay. Uh, let's check. Name?"
Rarity,"Uh, Rarity?"
Derpy,"[clears throat, mumbles] Oh! Here we go! Your package was delivered to Sweet Apple Acres."
Rarity,What?! It was supposed to be delivered to Rarity's Boutique!
Derpy,"Um... okay... but... now, the package was for Applejack, and she is at Sweet Apple Acres."
Rarity,"[low growl] Yes, it's for Applejack, but I will be delivering it."
Derpy,Uh... that's my job.
Rarity,It's a gift for Applejack from me.
Derpy,"[gasps] What if she opens it?! It shouldn't go to Sweet Apple Acres! Oh! Wait! It went to Sweet Acorn Orchard instead! [laughs] Oh, well, that's a relief."
Rarity,Why is that a relief?!
Derpy,Because Applejack's not in Sweet Acorn Orchard. Do you want me to get the package and deliver it to her?
Rarity,"No! [clears throat] Uh, may I have the address for Sweet Acorn Orchard? I think I'll just collect the package myself."
Derpy,Are you sure? 'Cause I would be happy to<U+0097>
Rarity,You have helped so much already.
Derpy,Break time!
Spike,Shopping for Rarity. No problem. She likes lots of stuff. I just need something special.
Pony Vendor 1,Brand-new top-of-the-line sewing equipment?
Pony Vendor 2,A priceless rhinestone necklace?
Others,"""Top Notch"": A sculpture of Rarity made from smaller sculptures of Rarity?"
Spike,[gasps] Oooh... Wow! Awesome! Shopping for Rarity. Slight problem. She likes lots of stuff. But nothing is special enough!
Discord,"Oh, goodness, no."
Rainbow Dash,Ugh!
Discord,Even worse!
Rainbow Dash,"Oh, come on!  Fluttershy would love a spa day!"
Discord,"Really? Love the stress of deciding which treatment to get? Love worrying that she's not relaxing enough? Or relaxing too much? And what about all those sweet animals she's left alone?! So much to worry about, and all because of you."
Rainbow Dash,She's Fluttershy! Everything makes her worry!
Discord,Now you sound like somepony who knows her!
Rainbow Dash,"Well, if you're such an expert on Fluttershy, what did you get her?"
Discord,"Oh, and you honestly expect me to tell you what I got Fluttershy so that you can one-up me? Well, I have half a mind to stop you entirely."
Rainbow Dash,Good! Please stop helping me! I'm begging you!
Discord,"Well, I suppose I could tell you what my backup present was."
Rainbow Dash,[sarcastically] Great. Still helping.
Discord,It would've made a lovely addition to her animal sanctuary. But you have to be the fastest pony in Equestria to even have a chance of<U+0097>
Rainbow Dash,"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. You're talking to the fastest pony in Equestria! If there's some fast animal out there Fluttershy would love, I'm the one who can get it."
Discord,"Oh, I just don't know."
Rainbow Dash,I'm calling it! Dibs!
Twilight Sparkle,"The ideal gift for Pinkie Pie needs to be A <U+0096> unique, B <U+0096> specific to her personality, and C <U+0096> food-based. What is a unique food? Cupcakes? Nah. Cookies? Nope. Pies? Pastries? Pudding? [gasps] Wait! [echoing] Puuuuuuuuuuuudding! [reading] ""After defeating the Windigos, the Earth pony, Pegasi, and unicorn nations prepared the first Hearth's Warming meal together. Chancellor Puddinghead made a pudding so delicious, legends were written about it!"" This is it! Unique, totally Pinkie, the most incredible dessert ever!"
Twilight Sparkle,Where's the recipe?!
Applejack,"I've narrowed down my choices for Spike to fire-dancing sticks, or a Power Ponies comic. Unenchanted, I think. Aah! What is that?!"
Fluttershy,Holly the Hearth's Warmer doll. Isn't she sweet?
Holly the Hearth's Warmer Doll,Holly the Hearth' [Flim's voice] I love being an expensive toy!
Applejack,Egh. Why'd you think that was a good gift for Rainbow Dash?
Fluttershy,It's the must-have gift of the season. And in short supply.
Applejack,"""Short supply"", huh? How much did that set you back?"
Fluttershy,All my bits. All my bits? Can I borrow some for the train ride home?
Applejack,Somethin' about this here doll seems fishy. And I ain't just talkin' about the smell of that plastic. Where'd you get it?
Applejack,Flim and Flam! What are those two Hearth's Warmin' hooligans up to now?!
Rarity,"Uh, is this Sweet Acorn Orchard?"
Butternut,It is. But we've never had no pony like you visit before.
Rarity,"Rarity. Uh, pleasure. I'm actually here about a package that was recently deliv<U+0097>"
Oak Nut,"Oh, that was from you?"
Rarity,"[sighs] So it did arrive! [chuckles] Uh, if I could just<U+0097>"
Butternut,We don't know how to thank you!
Rarity,Thank me?
Oak Nut,I was just sayin' to Butternut I wish we knew who our Hearth's Warming miracle was.
Butternut,Oak Nut and I couldn't believe it when we opened it. Pistachio said right away whoever sent it just got him.
Oak Nut,"Says when he put it on, he could feel his destiny."
Rarity,As an... acorn farmer?
Pistachio,"[scoffs] A farmer?! Filly, please! This is a Fedora Felt original! Look at this bold stitching. These daring textures. It's a whole new take on western chic. There is no way I would wear it in the grove!"
Butternut,We don't know where he got his fashion sense.
Oak Nut,"Heh. Far as we know, a hat's a hat."
Pistachio,Except when it's art.
Butternut,"Thank you, Rarity."
Pistachio,Rarity? The Rarity?!
Rarity,Mm-hmm.
Pistachio,You have to stay for lunch! I won't take no for an answer!
Rarity,"Oh, well, I, uh... I would be delighted."
Twilight Sparkle,"The recipe for Chancellor Puddinghead's magical pudding was filed under ""Magical Spells"", not ""Recipes"". Only took four hours to figure that out. Let's see. Nutmeg, sugarplums, gingerbread, candy canes... [reading] ""Warning <U+0096> To avoid untold culinary devastation, each ingredient must be measured with exact care."" [laughs] Book, have you met me?!"
Shining Armor and Princess Cadance,Happy Hearth's Harming!
Twilight Sparkle,But you're early. Your scroll said you were coming tomorrow.
Princess Cadance,"Uh, the scroll we sent yesterday?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Yesterday. Right. Welcome! Uh, what are you doing?"
Shining Armor,"Decorations not up. Frazzled mane. Determined look. I've seen this before. What are you obsessing about this time, Twily?"
Twilight Sparkle,Nothing!
Shining Armor,"So, decorations aren't up because...?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Uh, I thought it would be more fun if we all decorated it together!"
Princess Cadance,"Oh, that sounds wonderful. We could start decorating right aw<U+0097>"
Twilight Sparkle,After I finish one quick errand. Just a few ingredients. Nothing to obsess about here! [laughs] Make yourselves at home. Be right back! Promise!
Princess Cadance,She's definitely freaking out about something.
Shining Armor,"Oh, yeah."
Aurora,"By Blitzen's beard, it took you long enough!"
Pinkie Pie,Aah!
Pinkie Pie,Are you sure you were expecting me? My name is<U+0097>
Aurora,Pinkie Pie. I know. Because I know everything.
Alice,"Oh, don't be silly. You only know what's already happened. But you don't know what she's about to ask."
Pinkie Pie and Alice,What am I about to ask? How did you know I was gonna say that?!
Bori,Will you two stop showing off? She doesn't have all Hearth's Warming.
Pinkie Pie,Who are you reindeer?
Aurora,Aurora.
Bori,Bori.
Alice,Alice.
Others,"Aurora, Bori, The Gift Givers of the Grove!"
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! And you can help me give Twilight the best gift ever?!
Bori and Alice,Mm-hmm!
Aurora,What about those matching hats? They were so cute.
Pinkie Pie,"Well, that was<U+0097>"
Bori,"Before she had to get just one gift for Twilight. Try to keep up, Aurora."
Alice,I'm gonna get that box Pinkie is gonna say she likes.
Bori,"Aurora remembers gifts that have already happened. Alice knows the gifts that are going to happen. I just stay in the moment and keep the two of them in line. Speaking of, I believe we have a request for a gift."
Aurora,"The best gift is more precious than gold, but it cannot be sold."
Bori,"When it breaks, it's not ended, for quickly it's mended."
Alice,It can never be bought yet is easily sought. Ah! Here we go!
Pinkie Pie,Ooh! I like that box!
Alice,Told ya.
Pinkie Pie,[gasps] The perfect gift! Wow! I don't get it.
Alice,You will.
Flim,We said no refunds!
Flim,Oh. You.
Applejack,What are y'all doin' with these dolls and that ridiculous getup? Don't you have a resort to run?
Flim,"It's off-season. Besides, we're planning an expansion."
Flam,And expansions cost bits.
Flim and Flam,Flim and Flam's Fro-Yo Flume Ride!
Fluttershy,"Well, that sounds fu<U+0097>"
Applejack,It ain't no excuse for sellin' cheap dolls to ponies.
Flim,We're just giving ponies what they want.
Flam,Shopping for the perfect gift is stressful.
Fluttershy,"Oh, that's true."
Flim,You want to get something that really stands out.
Fluttershy,I do.
Flam,"And when you tell your friend you got them the hottest gift in Rainbow Falls, what'll they say?"
Fluttershy,"""Woo-hoo""?"
Holly the Hearth's Warmer Doll,"Holly the Hearth' [Flim's voice] The more you spend, the more your friend knows you love them!"
Fluttershy,"Oh, right. They really are good at selling things."
Flim,You may not like it.
Flam,"But technically, we're not doing anything wrong."
Flim,Ponies are desperate for the right gift.
Flam,And who are you to tell them this isn't it?
Flim,If ponies get tired of Holly after a few days...
Flam,"...or she falls apart, who really got hurt?"
Flim and Flam,Nopony!
Flim,Don't let the curtain hit ya on the way out.
Fluttershy,"Of course Rainbow Dash wouldn't want this! I'm so mad, I could just... kick!"
Applejack,Convincin' ponies to buy that doll ain't in the holiday spirit!
Fluttershy,But Flim and Flam have a point. We can't tell ponies what to buy.
Applejack,Huh. But maybe we can show 'em!
Rainbow Dash,Guh. Could you try to make less noise?
Discord,We'll move silently.
Discord,Blend into the shadows. The winterchilla will never hear us coming.
Rainbow Dash,Winterchilla?
Discord,"Small, adorable, fuzzy, and fast. But they're so rare, there's no telling where they<U+0097> Oh, there's one right there!"
Discord,"Now, if you're going to get it, I think the first move is to<U+0097>"
Rainbow Dash,Be super fast?
Flim,"Have a wonderful holiday. And remember, no refunds. Next!"
Flam,What are you doing here?
Applejack,Same as everypony else.
Applejack,"I want a Hearth's Warmer. In fact, I want three!"
Flim,Seriously?
Applejack,"[overacted] After I saw my friend here with hers, I knew I had to buy some for my granny, my brother, and my little sister!"
Flim,"Yeah, yeah, great story. Next!"
Fluttershy,"[overacted] But, Applejack, your granny, your brother, and your sister, they are all so different. How can the same doll be the right gift for all of them?"
Others,"""Burning passion"": Oh. Well, that might be true."
Applejack,"[overacted] But, Fluttershy, this is the must-have gift of the season."
Fluttershy,"[overacted] Just because it's must-have for one pony doesn't mean it's must-have for everypony, does it?"
Applejack,[overacted] That's true! I guess I need to put more thought into getting the right gift for each pony. Can I return these?
Flim and Flam,No refunds!
Applejack,"Oh, uh, you want 'em? I'm gonna go pick out gifts that are just as special as the ponies they're for."
Others,"""Minty Bubblegum"" I... think I'm gonna do some more shopping, too."
Flim,"Now, hang on a moment! Wait! Come back!"
Flam,We'll give you a great deal!
Flim and Flam,"Buy one, get one free?!"
Applejack,[sighs] The sweet sounds of the season.
Butternut,It's a shame you got to leave.
Rarity,"Oh, you've been so generous. But I must get home for a previous engagement. I'll be keeping an eye on you, Pistachio. I have the feeling you've got quite the future in fashion."
Pistachio,"Rarity! Rarity! I love my parents, but... they don't understand that we just had lunch with one of the most famous ponies in Equestria."
Pistachio,"I know you didn't send a Fedora Felt original to some nopony you've never met from Nowhere, Equestria. I'm sure this is actually for somepony special, so... if you want it back, I get it."
Rarity,The hat is indeed for somepony very special. And I couldn't bear to see him part with it.
Rarity,"But if I hear you call yourself a nopony again, you shan't be my guest for Fashion Week in Manehattan."
Pistachio,W-What<U+0097>? S-Seriou<U+0097>? Wha<U+0097>?!
Rarity,"[softly] Sorry, Applejack."
Applejack,Puttin' those two in their places makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
Fluttershy,"Ooh. But we never got gifts for Spike or Rainbow Dash, and it's already Hearth's Warming Eve."
Applejack,"It probably ain't what they're expectin', but we still got these. Yay."
Fluttershy,Don't do that.
Princess Cadance,Flurry loved sledding.
Shining Armor,Too bad her aunt wasn't there.
Twilight Sparkle,Shh!
Flurry Heart,Ooh!
Twilight Sparkle,"There. Ingredients measured exactly. Now, what were you saying?"
Shining Armor,"Hi, remember us? We came all the way from the Crystal Empire for some quality family time?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Okay, I did get a little stressed about Hearth's Warming this year."
Flurry Heart,Ooh!
Shining Armor,[laughs] What? You? Never!
Twilight Sparkle,So my friends decided we should do a Hearthswarming Helper and give one pony a present to save time.
Twilight Sparkle,What?
Shining Armor,"Let me guess. You got super worried about making sure the present was perfect and went all Twily-nanas, didn't you?"
Twilight Sparkle,"I wasn't Twily-nanas! Okay, fine. A little Twily-nanas."
Princess Cadance,"Twilight, we know you get overwhelmed. You should have just told us. We could've helped."
Twilight Sparkle,"The good news is Pinkie's present is almost done, and it's just friends and family and a calm, quiet Hearth's Warming Eve."
Discord,"[tearfully] Goodbye. Enjoy your exclusive pony-only holiday gathering. I'll just be home, spending quality time with... myself."
Rainbow Dash,"Uh... I wouldn't have this little fella without you, so... if you wanna join, Fluttershy would love having you. And I wouldn't totally hate it."
Discord,"Great! Awesome! In that case<U+0097> Oh, look! Sunset! It's officially Hearth's Warming Eve!"
Rainbow Dash,What is it doing?
Discord,"Oh. Uh, did I forget to mention that the winterchilla transforms into a winterzilla when the sun sets?"
Fluttershy,How did everypony's shopping go?
Rarity,Well...
Pinkie Pie,Uh...
Applejack,Yeeeeeah...
Spike,Coming!
Pinkie Pie,Did you get attacked by a party?
Spike,I fell asleep. On somepony's present.
Twilight Sparkle,Run!
Twilight Sparkle,The pudding is coming!
Rainbow Dash,Run! The winterzilla is coming!
Rainbow Dash,What is that?!
Twilight Sparkle,Magic pudding! What is that?!
Rainbow Dash,A winterchilla!
Twilight Sparkle,They turn into winterzillas after dark!
Rainbow Dash,Does everypony know this except me?!
Spike,Aah!
Twilight Sparkle,[gasps] You like the sparkly?
Twilight Sparkle,Just follow it this way!
Spike,Is this honestly the best plan we can come up with?!
Rainbow Dash,Can't you do something?!
Discord,I did! This is Fluttershy's gift.
Rainbow Dash,What?!
Rarity,"[grunting] A little help, please!"
Shining Armor,I've got this!
Princess Cadance,"Which one of us can fly, darling?"
Rarity,Whoa!
Shining Armor,Your mom sure is something.
Princess Cadance,[giggles] You're not so bad yourself.
Twilight Sparkle,No-no-no! Not that sparkly! This one!
Spike,[grunts] I'm okay if he doesn't want to chase me anymore!
Applejack,How are we gonna get rid of this thing?!
Discord,"Oh, for Scorpan's sake!"
Discord,Hello?! If only one of you had a way with animals?!
Fluttershy,"Oh, my."
Fluttershy,Uh... [clears throat] Excuse me.
Fluttershy,"Whoa! This is supposed to be the happiest time of year! So if this is how you plan on behaving, you can march yourself right back to where you came from!"
Fluttershy,"Awww. Your family is gone for the holidays, and you're all alone?"
Fluttershy,"I'm so sorry. If you calm down, I'm sure you could join us."
Pinkie Pie,"Uh, maybe leave the baking to me next time. [giggles, chewing] Actually, it's pretty good."
Twilight Sparkle,Chancellor Puddinghead's recipe.
Pinkie Pie,"Now, that's an impressive dessert!"
Twilight Sparkle,It's your Hearth's Warming present!
Pinkie Pie,Really? That's so thoughtful.
Twilight Sparkle,"It took a lot of research, but I<U+0097>"
Shining Armor,"Maybe focus on the task at hoof, Twily?"
Twilight Sparkle,"Right. The recipe needed to be exact. I think Flurry Heart added something while I wasn't looking, but I have no idea what to add to adjust it. A teaspoon of nutmeg, three sugarplums, extra<U+0097>"
Pinkie Pie,Gingerbread? Four more candy canes?
Twilight Sparkle,How do you know the recipe?
Pinkie Pie,I don't get it.
Alice,You will.
Pinkie Pie,"Happy Hearth's Warming, Twilight! I'm your Hearthswarming Helper!"
Discord,"Uh, a bit reindeer ex machina, but... two thumbs way up! Whoo!"
Twilight Sparkle,"Sorry for failing as a Hearthswarming Helper, Pinkie."
Rarity,"[sighs] At least Twilight has something to show for her effort. I ordered you a fabulous farm hat, Applejack. Alas, it decided it belonged to somepony else."
Applejack,Pops said sometimes the hat chooses the pony when he gave me this. Hopefully my gift inspired whoever's wearin' it to be the best farmer ever.
Rarity,"Uhhh, ooh... Something like that."
Fluttershy,We're really sorry about your gifts.
Applejack,We got a bit distracted with Flim and Flam's shenanigans.
Holly the Hearth's Warmer Doll,Holly the Hearth' [Flim's voice] Commercialism is the greatest gift of all!
Rainbow Dash,They're better than my gift. [sighs] Sorry about the winterzilla.
Fluttershy,"[giggling] Oh, he's a big sweetheart. And he ended up being really helpful."
Fluttershy,It was actually kind of nice to be the pony who saved the day for once.
Discord,"Oh, really? You mean a giant beast that only Fluttershy could tame, making her the hero of Hearth's Warming Eve, was a great gift?"
Discord,Imagine that.
Rainbow Dash,"[stutters, blows] You mean you tricked me into putting my friend in danger on purpose so you<U+0097>?!"
Rainbow Dash,Let's just say it was from both of us.
Applejack,I guess Hearthswarming Helper was kind of a disaster.
Princess Cadance,I don't know. Ponyville always seems to have way more exciting holidays than the Crystal Empire.
Spike,"There's one gift left, but I messed up, too. Your present's only kind of finished, Rarity, but I guess it's better than nothing."
Spike,"I wanted to get you Something oh, so rare A gift to show I care But nothing can compare"
Others,"To you, that's easy to see But I got stressed and overthought Until the day was shot And it was all for naught But now it's clear to me"
Others,I'm not gifted at gifting It's really pretty sad I tried to show I care But it turned out bad
Others,I'm not gifted at gifting So all that's left to say Is that I really hope my gifting Didn't ruin your holiday
Rarity,"Oh, Spike. A song is a lovely present."
Spike,I wanted to get you the best gift ever. I just couldn't figure out what it was.
Pinkie Pie,"Ooh, ooh! The Gift Givers told me that! Oh, what was it? The best gift is more precious than gold, but it cannot be sold. When it breaks, it's not ended, for quickly it's mended. It can never be bought yet is easily sought."
Pinkie Pie,What's so funny?
Twilight Sparkle,"It's a riddle, and the answer is ""friendship""!"
Twilight Sparkle,The most magical gift That I can recall It could've been big or small Or even nothing at all
Others,"It doesn't matter, you see If it's from my friends on whom I depend No matter what you spend It will be perfect to me"
Others,The true gift of gifting Is what it means inside We can show we care Spreading love far and wide
Others,The true gift of gifting Is totally free And you're the best there is at givin' it With the friendship that you give to me
All,We've all been friends forever And look how far we've come (how far we've come) The holiday brings us close And now it's time for fun (it's now begun)
Pinkie Pie,The greatest gift you give to me Is more precious than gold
All,Ah-ah-ah-ah
Pinkie Pie,"Never ended, always mended And it can't be bought or sold"
All,The true gift of gifting Is what it means inside We can show we care Spreading love far and wide
Others,The true gift of gifting Is totally free And you're the best there is at givin' it With the friendship that you give to me
Alice,"And so it worked out,"
Others,"And a lesson was learned, there's no need to obsess;"
Others,Gift-
Others,Friendship is the best gift of all.
